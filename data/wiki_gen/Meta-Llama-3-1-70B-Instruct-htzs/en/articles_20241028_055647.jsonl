The republic was formed after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and was marked by a complex and tumultuous relationship with Ukraine and Russia.\n\n## Crimean ASSR\n\nThe Crimean Peninsula had been part of the Russian Empire since 1783, but after the Russian Revolution, it became an Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (ASSR) within the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) in 1921. In 1954, the Crimean ASSR was transferred to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (USSR) by Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, reportedly as a gesture of goodwill to Ukraine. This decision had significant implications for the region, as it led to an influx of Ukrainian settlers and the marginalization of the indigenous Crimean Tatar population.\n\n## Name change in 1992\n\nFollowing the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Crimean ASSR declared its independence as the Republic of Crimea on May 5, 1992. This move was largely driven by the peninsula's Russian-speaking population, who felt a strong cultural and historical affinity with Russia. The new republic's president, Yuri Meshkov, was a vocal advocate for reunification with Russia and sought to establish close economic and military ties with Moscow.\n\n## Relations with Ukraine\n\nThe Ukrainian government, however, refused to recognize the Republic of Crimea as a sovereign state, viewing it as a separatist movement. Ukraine's president, Leonid Kravchuk, saw the peninsula as an integral part of Ukrainian territory and sought to maintain control over its governance and economy. The two sides engaged in a series of tense negotiations, with Ukraine offering Crimea a degree of autonomy within the Ukrainian state, but Meshkov and his government refused to compromise on their demands for independence.\n\n## Relations with Russia\n\nMeanwhile, Russia's president, Boris Yeltsin, was sympathetic to the Crimean cause and saw the peninsula as a vital strategic location for Russian interests. Russia maintained a significant military presence on the peninsula, and Yeltsin's government provided economic and diplomatic support to the Republic of Crimea. However, Russia ultimately stopped short of recognizing the republic as a sovereign state, reportedly due to concerns about the potential consequences for its relations with Ukraine and the international community.\n\n## Name change in 1995\n\nIn 1995, Ukraine's president, Leonid Kuchma, launched a concerted effort to reassert Ukrainian control over Crimea. In March of that year, the Ukrainian parliament passed a law abolishing the Republic of Crimea and establishing the Autonomous Republic of Crimea in its place. Meshkov's government was dissolved, and a new administration was installed, with a Ukrainian-appointed governor at its head. The peninsula's status as an autonomous republic within Ukraine has remained unchanged to this day.\n\n## See also\n\n* Crimean Tatars\n* Ukrainian-Russian relations\n* History of Crimea\n* Post-Soviet conflicts\n\n## Notes\n\nThis article provides a factual account of the Republic of Crimea's existence from 1992 to 1995.

The season is scheduled to run from 16 March to 30 September, with the 18 teams competing in a 23-round home-and-away season, followed by a four-week finals series.\n\n#Background\n\nThe 2023 AFL season follows a tumultuous 2022 season, which saw the COVID-19 pandemic continue to impact the league, with multiple games postponed or played behind closed doors. The 2022 season also saw a significant increase in player injuries, particularly to key players, which had a major impact on team performances. The 2023 season is expected to be highly competitive, with several teams expected to challenge for the premiership.\n\n#Coach appointments\n\nSeveral coaching changes were made during the off-season, with the most notable being the appointment of Alastair Clarkson as the new senior coach of the North Melbourne Football Club. Clarkson, a four-time premiership coach, replaced David Noble, who was sacked by the club in July 2022. Other coaching changes included the appointment of Craig McRae as the new senior coach of the Collingwood Football Club, replacing Craig McRae, and the appointment of Andrew McLeod as an assistant coach at the Adelaide Football Club.\n\n#Club leadership\n\nSeveral club leadership changes were made during the off-season, with the most notable being the appointment of former player, Chris Judd, as the new chief executive officer of the Carlton Football Club. Judd, a former Brownlow Medallist, replaced Cain Liddle, who resigned from the position in August 2022. Other leadership changes included the appointment of former player, Matthew Pavlich, as the new president of the Fremantle Football Club, replacing Dale Alcock.\n\n#Pre-season\n\nThe pre-season commenced on 14 February, with the first round of the AFL pre-season competition, the AAMI Community Series. The series featured 18 games, with each team playing three games. The series concluded on 12 March, with the Western Bulldogs defeating the Gold Coast Suns in the final game.\n\n#Season events\n\n##Increased focus on dangerous tackles\n\nThe 2023 season has seen an increased focus on player safety, particularly in relation to dangerous tackles. The AFL has implemented a number of rule changes, including the introduction of a new \"dangerous tackle\" rule, which sees players penalized for making contact with an opponent's head or neck. The rule change has been implemented in an effort to reduce the number of concussions and other head injuries in the game.\n\n##Hawthorn historical racism allegations\n\nIn August 2022, the Hawthorn Football Club was rocked by allegations of historical racism, with several former players and staff members alleging that they had experienced racism during their time at the club. The allegations led to an investigation by the AFL, which concluded that the club had failed to provide a safe and inclusive environment for all players and staff. The club has since implemented a number of changes, including the appointment of a new chief executive officer and the establishment of a reconciliation action plan.\n\n#Home-and-away season\n\n##Round 1\n\nThe home-and-away season commenced on 16 March, with the first round of games.

The outbreak, which began in May 2022, has affected multiple countries and territories worldwide, with cases reported in Africa, Europe, North America, South America, Asia, and Australia. This article provides an overview of the outbreak, including its background, characteristics, transmission, interventions, social aspects, and responses from global health authorities.\n\n#Background\n\n##Emergency preparedness prior to outbreak\n\nPrior to the 2022 outbreak, the World Health Organization (WHO) had been monitoring the monkeypox virus for several years, recognizing its potential for human-to-human transmission and the risk of widespread outbreaks. In 2019, the WHO included monkeypox in its list of priority diseases for which research and development of medical countermeasures, such as vaccines and treatments, were needed. Additionally, the WHO had developed guidelines for the surveillance, investigation, and response to monkeypox outbreaks.\n\n##Endemic mpox in Africa\n\nMonkeypox is endemic in several African countries, with cases reported in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Republic of Congo, Cameroon, Central African Republic, and Nigeria. The virus is typically transmitted through contact with infected animals, such as rodents, and can cause severe illness in humans. In Africa, monkeypox outbreaks are often associated with hunting and consuming bushmeat, which increases the risk of transmission from animals to humans.\n\n#Outbreak characteristics\n\n##Phylogenetics\n\nPhylogenetic analysis of the monkeypox virus has identified two distinct clades: the Congo Basin clade and the West African clade. The 2022 outbreak is primarily associated with the West African clade, which is considered to be less virulent than the Congo Basin clade.\n\n##Long incubation periods\n\nThe incubation period of monkeypox is typically 6-13 days, although it can range from 5-21 days. The long incubation period can make it challenging to identify and contain outbreaks, as individuals may be infectious before symptoms appear.\n\n##Mild clinical manifestations\n\nThe clinical manifestations of monkeypox are typically mild, with symptoms including fever, headache, muscle aches, and a characteristic rash. In severe cases, monkeypox can cause pneumonia, encephalitis, and death. The mild symptoms of the disease may contribute to underreporting and delayed diagnosis.\n\n##Fear of zoonotic spread\n\nThere is a concern that the monkeypox virus could spread from animals to humans, potentially leading to widespread outbreaks. The virus is present in several animal species, including rodents, and can be transmitted through contact with infected animals or contaminated materials.\n\n#Chronology\n\n##Deaths outside of Africa\n\nAs of [date], there have been [number] reported deaths outside of Africa, primarily in individuals with underlying health conditions. The deaths have been reported in [countries].\n\n#Transmission\n\n##Transmission patterns\n\nMonkeypox is primarily transmitted through close contact with an infected individual, including:\n\n* Direct contact with the rash or lesions\n* Contact with contaminated clothing or bedding\n* Respiratory droplets\n* Contact with infected animals or contaminated materials\n\n##Wastewater surveillance\n\nWastewater surveillance has been implemented in several countries to detect the presence of the monkeypox virus in sewage systems. This can provide an early warning system for potential outbreaks and help identify areas where the virus is present.\n\n#Interventions\n\n##Testing and containment\n\nTesting for monkeypox is typically performed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests. Containment measures, including isolation and contact tracing, have been implemented in several countries to slow the spread of the virus.\n\n##Vaccination\n\nSeveral vaccines are available for the prevention of monkeypox, including the ACAM2000 and JYNNEOS vaccines. Vaccination campaigns have been implemented in several countries, primarily targeting high-risk individuals, such as healthcare workers and laboratory personnel.\n\n#Social aspects\n\n##Misinformation\n\nMisinformation and disinformation about the monkeypox outbreak have been widely reported, potentially contributing to public anxiety and mistrust of health authorities. Social media platforms have been criticized for allowing the spread of false information, and efforts have been made to combat misinformation through public health campaigns and fact-checking initiatives.\n\n#Responses\n\n##World Health Organization\n\nThe WHO has played a key role in coordinating the global response to the monkeypox outbreak, providing technical assistance, and disseminating information to member states. The WHO has also activated its Incident Management System to coordinate the response.\n\n##Countries\n\nSeveral countries have implemented measures to respond to the outbreak, including:\n\n* Enhanced surveillance and testing\n* Contact tracing and isolation\n* Vaccination campaigns\n* Public health education and awareness campaigns\n\n##Dependent territories\n\nDependent territories, such as Puerto Rico and Guam, have also been affected by the outbreak, and efforts have been made to provide support and assistance to these territories.\n\n#Cases per country and territory\n\n##Timeline of first confirmed cases by country or territory\n\n* [Country/territory]: [date]\n* [Country/territory]: [date]\n* [Country/territory]: [date]\n\n##Timeline of suspected cases by country or territory\n\n* [Country/territory]: [date]\n* [Country/territory]: [date]\n* [Country/territory]: [date]\n\n##Timeline of first deaths by country or territory (in countries with initial 2022 detection from 6 May onwards)\n\n* [Country/territory]: [date]\n* [Country/territory]: [date]\n* [Country/territory]: [date]\n\n#See also\n\n* Monkeypox\n* World Health Organization\n* Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\n#References\n\n*Note: References have been omitted in accordance with the requirements.*\n\n#External links\n\n*Note: External links have been omitted in accordance with the requirements.*", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022–2023_mpox_outbreak\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Emergency preparedness prior to outbreak\n##Endemic mpox in Africa\n#Outbreak characteristics\n##Phylogenetics\n##Long incubation periods\n##Mild clinical manifestations\n##Fear of zoonotic spread\n#Chronology\n##Deaths outside of Africa\n#Transmission\n##Transmission patterns\n##Wastewater surveillance\n#Interventions\n##Testing and containment\n##Vaccination\n#Social aspects\n##Misinformation\n#Responses\n##World Health Organization\n##Countries\n##Dependent territories\n#Cases per country and territory\n##Timeline of first confirmed cases by country or territory\n##Timeline of suspected cases by country or territory\n##Timeline of first deaths by country or territory (in countries with initial 2022 detection from 6 May onwards)\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He is widely regarded as one of the most influential mathematicians of all time, and his work had a profound impact on the development of mathematics and science.\n\n# Biography\n\n## Youth and education\n\nJohann Carl Friedrich Gauss was born on April 30, 1777, in Braunschweig, Germany, to a family of modest means. His father, Gebhard Dietrich Gauss, was a gardener and a bricklayer, while his mother, Dorothea Benze, came from a family of butchers. Gauss's exceptional mathematical abilities were evident from an early age. At the age of three, he corrected an error in his father's calculations, and by the age of seven, he was performing complex arithmetic operations with ease.\n\nGauss's education began at a local elementary school, where he was taught by a strict and demanding teacher, J.G. Büttner. Büttner recognized Gauss's exceptional abilities and provided him with additional mathematical training. In 1788, Gauss entered the Martino-Katharineum, a secondary school in Braunschweig, where he excelled in mathematics and languages.\n\n## Private scholar\n\nIn 1791, Gauss's mother obtained a small stipend from the Duke of Braunschweig, which allowed Gauss to pursue his mathematical studies independently. During this period, Gauss made significant progress in number theory, algebra, and geometry, and he began to develop his own mathematical theories.\n\n## Professor in Göttingen\n\nIn 1807, Gauss was appointed as a professor of mathematics at the University of Göttingen, a position he held until his death in 1855. During his tenure, Gauss taught a wide range of mathematical subjects, including number theory, algebra, geometry, and astronomy. He also supervised several doctoral students, including Bernhard Riemann and Richard Dedekind.\n\n## Gauss's brain\n\nAfter his death, Gauss's brain was preserved and studied by the pathologist Rudolf Wagner. Wagner found that Gauss's brain had several unusual features, including a highly developed cerebral cortex and a large number of neurons. These findings have been interpreted as evidence of Gauss's exceptional cognitive abilities.\n\n## Family\n\nGauss married Johanna Osthoff in 1805, and they had three children together. After Johanna's death in 1809, Gauss married Minna Waldeck in 1810, and they had three children together. Gauss was known to be a devoted father and husband, and he placed great importance on his family life.\n\n## Personality\n\n### Scholar\n\nGauss was a prolific scholar who worked tirelessly throughout his life. He was known for his exceptional mathematical abilities, his attention to detail, and his ability to think critically. Gauss was also a master of several languages, including Latin, Greek, and French.\n\n### Private man\n\nDespite his fame and reputation, Gauss was a private and introverted person who preferred to avoid the spotlight. He was known to be modest and humble, and he never sought to draw attention to himself. Gauss was also a deeply religious person who believed in the importance of morality and ethics.\n\n# Scientific work\n\n## Algebra and number theory\n\n### Fundamental theorem of algebra\n\nGauss's most famous contribution to algebra is the fundamental theorem of algebra, which states that every non-constant polynomial equation has at least one complex root. Gauss proved this theorem in 1799, when he was just 22 years old.\n\n### Disquisitiones Arithmeticae\n\nIn 1801, Gauss published his magnum opus, the Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, a comprehensive treatise on number theory. This work introduced several new concepts, including the theory of congruences, the law of quadratic reciprocity, and the concept of a prime number.\n\n### Further investigations\n\nGauss continued to work on number theory throughout his life, making significant contributions to the field. He introduced the concept of the Gaussian distribution, and he developed the theory of elliptic curves.\n\n## Analysis\n\n### Numeric analysis\n\nGauss made significant contributions to numeric analysis, including the development of the Gaussian method for solving systems of linear equations. He also introduced the concept of the Gaussian error function, which is used to model the distribution of errors in measurement.\n\n## Chronology\n\nGauss's work on chronology involved the study of the timing of celestial events, including solar eclipses and planetary transits. He developed a new method for calculating the orbits of celestial bodies, which was more accurate than previous methods.\n\n## Astronomy\n\nGauss's work on astronomy involved the study of the orbits of celestial bodies, including planets, asteroids, and comets. He developed a new method for calculating the orbits of celestial bodies, which was more accurate than previous methods.\n\n## Theory of errors\n\nGauss's work on the theory of errors involved the study of the distribution of errors in measurement. He introduced the concept of the Gaussian distribution, which is used to model the distribution of errors in measurement.\n\n## Arc measurement and geodetic survey\n\nGauss's work on arc measurement and geodetic survey involved the study of the shape of the Earth and the measurement of its size. He developed a new method for measuring the shape of the Earth, which was more accurate than previous methods.\n\n## Differential geometry\n\nGauss's work on differential geometry involved the study of the properties of curves and surfaces.

It was founded in 1994 and is operated by the Football Association of Indonesia (PSSI). The league is contested by 18 clubs and operates on a system of promotion and relegation with Liga 2.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\n### Origins\n\nThe Indonesian football league system was first established in 1930, with the formation of the Persatuan Sepakbola Seluruh Indonesia (PSSI). However, the league was not professional and was dominated by amateur clubs. In the 1970s and 1980s, Indonesian football began to gain popularity, and the PSSI started to explore the possibility of creating a professional league.\n\n### Foundation\n\nIn 1994, the PSSI founded the Liga Indonesia, which was the precursor to the current Liga 1. The league was initially contested by 28 clubs and was divided into two divisions. The top division, known as the Liga Indonesia Premier Division, was contested by 10 clubs, while the second division, known as the Liga Indonesia First Division, was contested by 18 clubs.\n\n### Dualism\n\nIn 2011, the PSSI and the Indonesian Professional Sports Agency (BOPI) signed an agreement to establish a new professional league, known as the Indonesian Super League (ISL). The ISL was contested by 15 clubs and was operated by the PT Liga Indonesia, a subsidiary of the PSSI. However, the PSSI and the PT Liga Indonesia had different visions for the league, which led to a period of dualism in Indonesian football.\n\n### Government intervention and FIFA suspension\n\nIn 2015, the Indonesian government intervened in the dispute between the PSSI and the PT Liga Indonesia, and the PSSI was suspended by FIFA. The suspension was lifted in 2016, after the PSSI and the PT Liga Indonesia reached an agreement to merge the two leagues. The new league, known as the Liga 1, was established in 2017.\n\n### Name change\n\nIn 2017, the PSSI announced that the Liga Indonesia would be rebranded as the Liga 1. The name change was made to reflect the league's new status as the top professional division of Indonesian football.\n\nCompetition format\n-------------------\n\n### Competition\n\nThe Liga 1 is contested by 18 clubs, with each club playing the others twice, once at home and once away. The club with the most points at the end of the season is crowned the champion.\n\n### Promotion and relegation\n\nThe Liga 1 operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the Liga 2. The bottom three clubs in the Liga 1 are relegated to the Liga 2, while the top three clubs in the Liga 2 are promoted to the Liga 1.\n\n### Video assistant referee\n\nThe Liga 1 uses video assistant referees (VARs) to assist with decision-making. VARs are used to review decisions made by the on-field referee, such as goals, penalties, and direct red cards.\n\nClubs\n------\n\n### Champions\n\nThe following clubs have won the Liga 1 title:\n\n* 2017: Bhayangkara\n* 2018: Persebaya\n* 2019: Bali United\n* 2020: Not awarded (season cancelled due to COVID-19 pandemic)\n* 2021-22: Bali United\n* 2022-23: PSM Makassar\n\n### Performance by clubs\n\nThe following table shows the performance of each club in the Liga 1:\n\n| Club | Seasons | Matches | Wins | Draws | Losses | Goals for | Goals against | Points |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Bali United | 6 | 141 | 74 | 32 | 35 | 233 | 145 | 254 |\n| Persebaya | 6 | 141 | 63 | 36 | 42 | 206 | 163 | 225 |\n| PSM Makassar | 6 | 141 | 62 | 34 | 45 | 202 | 174 | 220 |\n| Bhayangkara | 6 | 141 | 59 | 35 | 47 | 201 | 181 | 212 |\n| Persija Jakarta | 6 | 141 | 56 | 36 | 49 | 192 | 184 | 204 |\n\n### 2024-25 season\n\nThe 2024-25 Liga 1 season is scheduled to start in July 2024.

The film is based on the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the director of the Manhattan Project, which developed the atomic bomb during World War II. The film explores Oppenheimer's complex personality, his relationships, and his involvement in the development of the atomic bomb.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe film tells the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a brilliant and charismatic physicist who is recruited to lead the Manhattan Project. As Oppenheimer becomes increasingly obsessed with the project, he must navigate the complexities of his personal relationships and the moral implications of his work. The film explores Oppenheimer's relationships with his colleagues, including Enrico Fermi and Ernest Lawrence, as well as his romantic relationships with Jean Tatlock and Katherine \"Kitty\" Posen.\n\nAs the project progresses, Oppenheimer becomes increasingly consumed by the pressure to succeed, and his relationships begin to suffer. The film culminates with the successful detonation of the atomic bomb in the Trinity test, and Oppenheimer's subsequent grappling with the consequences of his creation.\n\n# Cast\n\n* Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer\n* Emily Blunt as Katherine \"Kitty\" Posen\n* Matt Damon as Leslie Groves\n* Robert Downey Jr. as Lewis Strauss\n* Josh Hartnett as Ernest Lawrence\n* Dane DeHaan as Kenneth Nichols\n* Alden Ehrenreich as Donald Hornig\n* Rami Malek as Lyndon B.

Nolan was drawn to Oppenheimer's complex personality and the moral implications of his work on the atomic bomb.\n\nIn 2019, Nolan announced that he would be directing a film about Oppenheimer, with Cillian Murphy set to star in the title role. The film was set to be produced by Nolan's production company, Syncopy, in association with Atlas Entertainment and Universal Pictures.\n\n## Writing\n\nNolan spent several years researching and writing the screenplay for Oppenheimer. He drew on a range of sources, including Oppenheimer's personal letters and diaries, as well as historical accounts of the Manhattan Project.\n\nThe screenplay explores Oppenheimer's complex personality and his relationships, as well as the moral implications of his work on the atomic bomb. Nolan has said that he was drawn to Oppenheimer's contradictions - his brilliance and charisma, but also his insecurities and flaws.\n\n## Casting\n\nCillian Murphy was Nolan's first choice to play Oppenheimer, and he was officially cast in the role in 2019. Murphy had previously worked with Nolan on several films, including Batman Begins and Dunkirk.\n\nThe rest of the cast was announced over the course of 2020 and 2021, with Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, and Robert Downey Jr. all joining the film. The cast also includes several younger actors, including Dane DeHaan and Alden Ehrenreich.\n\n## Filming\n\nPrincipal photography on Oppenheimer began in January 2022, and lasted for several months. The film was shot on location in the United States and the United Kingdom, with Nolan using a combination of digital and IMAX cameras.\n\nThe film's cinematographer, Hoyte van Hoytema, worked closely with Nolan to develop a distinctive visual style for the film. The film's color palette is muted and subdued, with a focus on blues and greys.\n\n## Post-production\n\nPost-production on Oppenheimer began in the spring of 2022, and lasted for several months. The film's editor, Jennifer Lame, worked closely with Nolan to develop a complex and nuanced edit for the film.\n\nThe film's visual effects were created by a team of artists and technicians at DNEG, a leading visual effects company. The film's VFX supervisor, Andrew Whitehurst, worked closely with Nolan to develop a range of effects, including the Trinity test sequence.\n\n# Music\n\nThe film's score was composed by Ludwig Göransson, who had previously worked with Nolan on Tenet. The score is a complex and nuanced blend of orchestral and electronic elements, with a focus on percussion and strings.\n\nThe film also features a range of period-specific music, including jazz and blues tracks from the 1940s.\n\n# Marketing\n\nMarketing for Oppenheimer began in the spring of 2023, with the release of a teaser trailer. The trailer was widely praised for its atmospheric and evocative tone, and generated significant buzz for the film.\n\nThe film's official trailer was released in the summer of 2023, and featured a range of footage from the film. The trailer was widely praised for its intensity and emotion, and helped to generate further buzz for the film.\n\n# Release\n\n## Theatrical\n\nOppenheimer was released in theaters on July 21, 2023, in the United States and the United Kingdom. The film was released in IMAX and Dolby Cinema formats, with a range of premium audio and visual options.\n\nThe film received widespread critical acclaim, with many praising its performances, direction, and historical accuracy.\n\n### Classifications and censorship\n\nOppenheimer received an R rating from the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) for its language, violence, and some suggestive content.\n\nThe film was also rated 15 by the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) for its strong language, violence, and some suggestive content.\n\n## Home media\n\nOppenheimer was released on home media in the fall of 2023, with a range of options including digital, DVD, and Blu-ray.\n\nThe film's home media release included a range of special features, including deleted scenes, behind-the-scenes footage, and a making-of documentary.\n\n# Reception\n\n## Box office\n\n### United States and Canada\n\nOppenheimer grossed $45 million in its opening weekend in the United States and Canada, with a per-screen average of $10,000.\n\nThe film went on to gross over $150 million in the United States and Canada, making it one of the highest-grossing films of the year.\n\n### Japan\n\nOppenheimer grossed $20 million in its opening weekend in Japan, with a per-screen average of $5,000.\n\nThe film went on to gross over $50 million in Japan, making it one of the highest-grossing foreign films of the year.\n\n### Other territories\n\nOppenheimer grossed over $100 million in other territories, including the United Kingdom, Australia, and China.\n\nThe film's worldwide gross was over $300 million, making it one of the highest-grossing films of the year.\n\n## Critical response\n\nOppenheimer received widespread critical acclaim, with many praising its performances, direction, and historical accuracy.\n\nThe film holds a 92% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 8.5/10.\n\nThe film also holds a 90% approval rating on Metacritic, with an average rating of 8.5/10.\n\n## Influence on legislation\n\nOppenheimer's portrayal of the development of the atomic bomb and its consequences helped to raise awareness of the need for stricter regulations and safeguards around nuclear technology.\n\nThe film's release coincided with a renewed debate around nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, with many calling for greater international cooperation and action to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.\n\n# Accuracy and omissions\n\nWhile Oppenheimer is based on real events and figures, some artistic liberties were taken to enhance the storytelling and drama.\n\nThe film's portrayal of Oppenheimer's relationships and personal life was based on historical records and accounts, but some details were altered or omitted for dramatic effect.\n\n# Accolades\n\nOppenheimer received widespread critical acclaim and won numerous awards and nominations, including several Academy Awards.\n\nThe film's cast and crew were recognized for their outstanding work, including Cillian Murphy, who won several awards for his portrayal of Oppenheimer.\n\n# See also\n\n* J.

The case has garnered significant attention and sparked intense debate about the handling of sensitive information, executive privilege, and the rule of law.\n\n#Background\n\nIn January 2021, the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) requested that the Trump administration return presidential records, including documents marked as classified, that were still in the possession of the former president. After months of negotiations, Trump's representatives handed over 15 boxes of documents to NARA in January 2022. However, upon review, NARA discovered that some of the documents contained markings indicating they were classified.\n\nIn February 2022, the Department of Justice (DOJ) launched an investigation into the handling of classified documents by Trump. The investigation was led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and focused on whether Trump had mishandled classified documents, potentially violating the Espionage Act.\n\n#Indictments and Arraignments\n\n##Original Indictment\n\nOn June 8, 2023, a grand jury in the Southern District of Florida indicted Trump on 32 counts related to the mishandling of classified documents. The indictment alleged that Trump had willfully retained, concealed, and failed to return classified documents, including those related to national defense and the nuclear programs of other countries.\n\n##Superseding Indictment\n\nOn July 18, 2023, a superseding indictment was unsealed, adding 16 new counts and charging two additional defendants: Waltine Nauta, a former Trump aide, and Carlos De Oliveira, a Trump employee. The superseding indictment alleged that Nauta and De Oliveira had assisted Trump in concealing and removing classified documents from the White House.\n\n##Assignment of District Judge\n\nThe case was assigned to District Judge Aileen Cannon of the Southern District of Florida. Judge Cannon had previously served as a law clerk to Judge Steven Colloton of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.\n\n##Arraignments\n\n###Trump\n\nTrump was arraigned on June 13, 2023, at the federal courthouse in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. He pleaded not guilty to all charges.\n\n###Nauta\n\nNauta was arraigned on July 20, 2023, and also pleaded not guilty to all charges.\n\n###De Oliveira\n\nDe Oliveira was arraigned on July 21, 2023, and pleaded not guilty to all charges.\n\n#Pretrial Proceedings\n\n##2023\n\nIn June 2023, Trump's lawyers filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, arguing that the charges were unconstitutional and that the DOJ had overstepped its authority. The motion was denied by Judge Cannon in July 2023.\n\n##2024\n\n###Trump's Request to Indefinitely Delay Trial\n\nIn January 2024, Trump's lawyers filed a motion to indefinitely delay the trial, citing the need for more time to review the large volume of evidence and to prepare for the trial. The motion was opposed by the DOJ, which argued that the trial should proceed as scheduled.\n\n#Dismissal and Appeal\n\nOn March 15, 2024, Judge Cannon granted Trump's motion to dismiss the indictment, citing the need for further review of the evidence and the potential for executive privilege claims. The DOJ appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.\n\n#Response\n\n##To Indictment\n\n###Trump\n\nTrump responded to the indictment by calling it a \"witch hunt\" and claiming that the charges were \"fake\" and \"politically motivated.\"\n\n###Other Republicans\n\nMany other Republicans, including some of Trump's former allies, condemned the indictment and argued that it was an overreach by the DOJ.\n\n###Democrats\n\nDemocrats praised the indictment, arguing that it was a necessary step to hold Trump accountable for his actions and to protect national security.\n\n##To Dismissal\n\n###Trump\n\nTrump responded to the dismissal of the indictment by claiming victory and arguing that the decision vindicated his claims of a \"witch hunt.\"\n\n###DOJ\n\nThe DOJ expressed disappointment with the decision and vowed to appeal, arguing that the dismissal was incorrect and that the charges should be reinstated.\n\n#See also\n\n* List of federal politicians convicted of crimes\n* List of lawsuits involving Donald Trump\n\n#References\n\n[Note: No references or citations are included, as per the request.]\n\n#External links\n\n[Note: No external links are included, as per the request.]", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Federal_prosecution_of_Donald_Trump_(classified_documents_case)\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Indictments and arraignments\n##Original indictment\n##Superseding indictment\n##Assignment of district judge\n##Arraignments\n###Trump\n###Nauta\n###De Oliveira\n#Pretrial proceedings\n##2023\n##2024\n###Trump's request to indefinitely delay trial\n#Dismissal and appeal\n#Response\n##To indictment\n###Trump\n###Other Republicans\n###Democrats\n##To dismissal\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This approach to game development allows for a collaborative and community-driven process, where developers and players can contribute to the game's creation and improvement.\n\nDefinition and differentiation\n-----------------------------\n\nOpen-source video games are distinct from free-to-play games, which are games that can be played without a upfront cost but may have restrictions on gameplay or in-game purchases. Open-source games are also different from freeware games, which are games that can be downloaded and played for free but whose source code is not made available. Open-source games are typically distributed under licenses that allow users to modify and distribute the code, such as the GNU General Public License (GPL) or the MIT License.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nThe concept of open-source software has been around since the 1980s, but it wasn't until the 1990s that the idea of open-source game development began to take shape. The rise of the internet and the availability of game development tools and resources made it possible for developers to collaborate on game projects and share their code with others.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\n### Beginnings and early games\n\nOne of the earliest examples of an open-source video game is the 1993 game \"Doom,\" which was released by id Software under a permissive license that allowed users to modify and distribute the game's source code. This led to the creation of numerous modifications, or \"mods,\" that added new features and gameplay mechanics to the game.\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, other open-source games began to emerge, such as \"FreeCiv\" and \"FreeDoom.\" These games were often created by small teams of developers who were passionate about game development and wanted to create games that were free and open to the public.\n\n### 3D games and source releases\n\nThe release of the source code for the 3D game engine \"Quake\" in 1999 marked a significant milestone in the development of open-source games. The \"Quake\" engine was widely used in the game development industry, and its release under an open-source license allowed developers to create their own 3D games using the engine.\n\nOther 3D game engines, such as the \"Unreal Engine\" and the \"id Tech 3\" engine, were also released under open-source licenses, allowing developers to create complex and visually stunning games. This led to the creation of numerous open-source 3D games, such as \"Unvanquished\" and \"Nexuiz.\"\n\n### Rise in popularity and diversity\n\nIn the mid-2000s, open-source games began to gain popularity, with the release of games such as \"Battle for Wesnoth\" and \"Glest.\" These games were created by large communities of developers and featured complex gameplay mechanics and engaging storylines.\n\nThe rise of digital distribution platforms, such as Steam and GOG.com, also helped to increase the visibility of open-source games. These platforms allowed developers to distribute their games to a wide audience and provided a convenient way for players to discover and download open-source games.\n\n### Greater organization\n\nAs the open-source game development community grew, so did the need for greater organization and coordination. The creation of websites such as OpenGameArt.org and Open Source Games provided a central hub for developers to share their work and collaborate on projects.\n\nThe rise of social media and online communities also helped to facilitate communication and collaboration among developers.

Born and raised in Tokyo, Japan, Tsumyoki's music often incorporates elements of Japanese culture, folklore, and mythology, setting him apart from other electronic music artists.\n\nEarly Life\n------------\n\nTsumyoki was born on November 12, 1995, in Tokyo, Japan. Growing up in a culturally rich and vibrant city, he was exposed to a wide range of musical influences from an early age. His parents, both music lovers, encouraged his interest in music, and he began taking piano lessons at the age of 6. As he grew older, Tsumyoki became increasingly fascinated with electronic music, particularly the works of Japanese artists such as Ryuichi Sakamoto and Haruomi Hosono.\n\nCareer\n--------\n\n### 2018–2019: Early Beginnings\n\nTsumyoki's music career began in 2018 when he started producing tracks in his bedroom studio. He was largely self-taught, learning the basics of music production through online tutorials and YouTube videos. Initially, his music was heavily influenced by Western electronic dance music, but as he delved deeper into his Japanese heritage, he began to incorporate traditional Japanese sounds and instruments into his productions.\n\nIn 2019, Tsumyoki released his debut single, \"Sakura,\" which gained moderate attention on social media platforms. The track's unique blend of traditional Japanese instruments and modern electronic beats caught the attention of several Japanese music bloggers, who praised Tsumyoki's innovative approach to electronic music.\n\n### 2019–present: Rise to Success\n\nTsumyoki's breakthrough came in 2019 with the release of his debut EP, \"Kokoro.\" The EP's lead single, \"Kintsugi,\" featuring Japanese vocalist Aimer, became a viral hit on YouTube and TikTok, racking up millions of views and streams. The track's success led to Tsumyoki signing with a major Japanese record label, Pony Canyon, and embarking on his first national tour.\n\nSince then, Tsumyoki has released several critically acclaimed albums and EPs, including \"Yūgen\" (2020) and \"Garden\" (2022). His music has been praised for its unique blend of traditional Japanese sounds and modern electronic production, and he has collaborated with several high-profile artists, including Japanese rapper Zorn and British producer Four Tet.\n\nGoa Trap Culture\n-----------------\n\nTsumyoki is often credited with helping to popularize the \"Goa Trap\" genre, a subgenre of electronic dance music that combines elements of Goa trance and trap music. Goa Trap emerged in the early 2010s, primarily in Japan and India, and is characterized by its fast-paced, psychedelic rhythms and often incorporates traditional Indian and Japanese instruments.\n\nTsumyoki's music often incorporates elements of Goa Trap, particularly in his earlier works. However, he has also experimented with a wide range of other styles, including ambient, house, and techno. His music is known for its atmospheric soundscapes and often features intricate melodies and rhythms.\n\nDiscography\n------------\n\n### Albums\n\n* \"Yūgen\" (2020)\n* \"Garden\" (2022)\n\n### EPs\n\n* \"Kokoro\" (2019)\n* \"Sora\" (2021)\n\n### Singles and Collaborations\n\n* \"Sakura\" (2019)\n* \"Kintsugi\" (feat.

The storm was the first named storm of the 2022 Atlantic hurricane season, which officially began on June 1. Alex brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to several countries in the Caribbean and Florida, causing significant disruptions and damage.\n\n#Meteorological history\n\nTropical Storm Alex originated from a tropical wave that emerged off the west coast of Africa on May 27, 2022. The wave moved westward across the Atlantic, gradually developing a closed circulation and increasing convection. By June 2, the system had become a tropical depression, located about 1,200 miles (1,900 km) east of the Lesser Antilles. The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Alex on June 3, with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (65 km/h).\n\nAlex moved west-northwestward across the Atlantic, passing north of the Lesser Antilles on June 4. The storm encountered favorable environmental conditions, including low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures, which allowed it to strengthen further. Alex reached its peak intensity on June 5, with maximum sustained winds of 70 mph (115 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 991 mbar (29.26 inHg).\n\nOn June 6, Alex began to interact with a mid-level trough, which caused the storm to slow down and turn northwestward. The storm made landfall in Cuba on June 7, bringing heavy rainfall and strong winds to the island. Alex then moved into the southeastern Gulf of Mexico, where it encountered cooler waters and increasing wind shear, causing it to weaken.\n\n#Preparations and impact\n\n##Cuba\n\nTropical Storm Alex brought significant impacts to Cuba, particularly in the western and central regions of the island. Heavy rainfall caused widespread flooding, with some areas receiving over 10 inches (250 mm) of rain. Strong winds also caused power outages and damage to buildings and infrastructure.\n\nThe Cuban government issued a tropical storm warning for the entire island, and evacuations were ordered for low-lying areas. Emergency responders were deployed to affected areas to assist with rescue and relief efforts.\n\n##Florida\n\nTropical Storm Alex also brought significant impacts to southern Florida, particularly in the Miami-Dade and Broward counties. Heavy rainfall caused flooding in several areas, including Miami Beach, where waters rose to over 3 feet (90 cm) in some areas. Strong winds also caused power outages and damage to buildings and infrastructure.\n\nThe National Weather Service issued a tropical storm warning for the Miami-Dade and Broward counties, and a flood watch was issued for several areas. Emergency responders were deployed to affected areas to assist with rescue and relief efforts.\n\n##The Bahamas\n\nTropical Storm Alex also brought impacts to the Bahamas, particularly in the northern islands. Heavy rainfall caused flooding in several areas, and strong winds caused power outages and damage to buildings and infrastructure.\n\nThe Bahamian government issued a tropical storm warning for the entire archipelago, and evacuations were ordered for low-lying areas. Emergency responders were deployed to affected areas to assist with rescue and relief efforts.\n\n#See also\n\n* 2022 Atlantic hurricane season\n* Tropical cyclones\n* List of Atlantic hurricanes\n* List of tropical cyclones\n\n#References\n\n*Note: This article does not include references as per the requirements*\n\n#External links\n\n* National Hurricane Center (NHC)\n* National Weather Service (NWS)\n* Cuban Meteorological Institute (INSMET)\n* Bahamian Meteorological Department (BMD)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Tropical_Storm_Alex_(2022)\" following this outline:\n\n#Meteorological history\n#Preparations and impact\n##Cuba\n##Florida\n##The Bahamas\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The couple is joined by a group of wealthy and influential patrons, including a food critic, a wealthy couple, and a businessman.\n\nAs the evening progresses, the guests begin to realize that something is off. The chef's behavior becomes increasingly erratic, and the guests start to vanish one by one. It becomes clear that the chef has a sinister plan, and the guests are trapped on the island with no way to escape.\n\nAs the night wears on, the guests are subjected to a series of gruesome and humiliating challenges, all designed to test their worthiness to dine at the exclusive restaurant. The film builds towards a shocking climax, as the guests fight for survival and the true nature of the chef's plan is revealed.\n\n# Cast\n\n* Ralph Fiennes as Chef Julian Slowik\n* Anya Taylor-Joy as Maddy\n* Nicholas Hoult as Tyler\n* Hong Chau as Elsa\n* Janet McTeer as Lillian Bloom\n* Reed Birney as Richard\n* Judith Light as Anne\n* Paul Adelstein as Ted\n* Rob Yang as Bryce\n* Arturo Castro as Soren\n\n# Production\n\n## Development\n\nThe Menu was written by Seth Reiss and Will Tracy, and was inspired by their own experiences with fine dining and the exclusivity of high-end restaurants.

The election was called after the resignation of Prime Minister Mario Draghi and the subsequent collapse of his government.\n\n# Background\n\nThe 2022 Italian general election was the third general election to be held in Italy in the last five years, following the 2018 general election and the 2020 regional elections. The election was also the first to be held since the COVID-19 pandemic, which had a significant impact on Italian politics and society.\n\nThe election was marked by a high level of fragmentation among the parties, with several new parties and alliances emerging in the run-up to the election. The centre-left Democratic Party (PD) and the centre-right Forza Italia (FI) were the two largest parties in the outgoing government, but they faced significant challenges from the Five Star Movement (M5S) and the League (Lega), two populist parties that had gained significant support in recent years.\n\n# Electoral Campaign\n\nThe electoral campaign was marked by a high level of polarization and controversy, with several parties and candidates engaging in negative campaigning and personal attacks. The campaign was also marked by a significant increase in the use of social media and online platforms, which played a major role in shaping public opinion and influencing the outcome of the election.\n\n## Main Parties' Slogans\n\nThe main parties' slogans for the 2022 Italian general election were:\n\n* Democratic Party (PD): \"Scegliamo il futuro\" (\"We choose the future\")\n* Five Star Movement (M5S): \"Il cambiamento è possibile\" (\"Change is possible\")\n* League (Lega): \"Prima gli italiani\" (\"Italians first\")\n* Forza Italia (FI): \"L'Italia per gli italiani\" (\"Italy for Italians\")\n* Brothers of Italy (FdI): \"L'Italia ai primi posti\" (\"Italy in the top spots\")\n\n## Electoral Debates\n\nThere were several electoral debates held during the campaign, featuring the leaders of the main parties. The debates were broadcast on television and online platforms, and were widely followed by the public.\n\n# Electoral System\n\nThe electoral system used in the 2022 Italian general election was a mixed system, combining elements of proportional representation and first-past-the-post (FPTP) voting. The system was introduced in 2017, and was used for the first time in the 2018 general election.\n\nUnder the system, 37% of the seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 34% of the seats in the Senate of the Republic were allocated using FPTP voting in single-member constituencies. The remaining seats were allocated using proportional representation in multi-member constituencies.\n\n# Electoral Lists\n\nThere were several electoral lists that contested the 2022 Italian general election, representing a wide range of parties and alliances.\n\n## Lists with Parliamentary Representation\n\nThe main lists with parliamentary representation were:\n\n* Centre-left coalition: Democratic Party (PD), Left Ecology Freedom (SEL), and Italian Socialist Party (PSI)\n* Centre-right coalition: Forza Italia (FI), League (Lega), and Brothers of Italy (FdI)\n* Five Star Movement (M5S)\n* Free and Equal (LeU)\n* More Europe (+Eu)\n\n## Lists without Parliamentary Representation\n\nThere were several lists that did not have parliamentary representation, including:\n\n* Italian Radicals (Rad)\n* Communist Party (PC)\n* New Force (FN)\n* CasaPound (CPI)\n\n## Lists Running Only in Overseas Constituencies\n\nThere were several lists that ran only in the overseas constituencies, representing the interests of Italian citizens living abroad. These lists included:\n\n* Italian Democratic Party (PDI)\n* Union of Italians in the World (UMI)\n* Associative Movement of Italians Abroad (MAIE)\n\n# Opinion Polls\n\nThere were several opinion polls conducted during the campaign, which showed a high level of fragmentation among the parties and a significant increase in support for the centre-right coalition.\n\n# Voter Turnout\n\nThe voter turnout for the 2022 Italian general election was 63.8%, which was down from the 72.9% turnout in the 2018 general election.\n\n# Results\n\n## Chamber of Deputies\n\n### Overall Results\n\nThe overall results for the Chamber of Deputies were:\n\n* Centre-right coalition: 237 seats (43.8% of the vote)\n* Five Star Movement (M5S): 105 seats (15.4% of the vote)\n* Centre-left coalition: 85 seats (19.1% of the vote)\n* Free and Equal (LeU): 12 seats (3.2% of the vote)\n* More Europe (+Eu): 2 seats (2.5% of the vote)\n\n### Proportional and FPTP Results\n\nThe proportional and FPTP results for the Chamber of Deputies were:\n\n* Proportional representation: Centre-right coalition 114 seats, Five Star Movement (M5S) 72 seats, Centre-left coalition 54 seats\n* FPTP voting: Centre-right coalition 123 seats, Five Star Movement (M5S) 33 seats, Centre-left coalition 31 seats\n\n### Aosta Valley\n\nThe results for the Aosta Valley constituency were:\n\n* Centre-right coalition: 1 seat (43.5% of the vote)\n* Centre-left coalition: 0 seats (31.4% of the vote)\n* Five Star Movement (M5S): 0 seats (13.6% of the vote)\n\n### Overseas Constituencies\n\nThe results for the overseas constituencies were:\n\n* Europe: Centre-right coalition 2 seats, Centre-left coalition 1 seat, Five Star Movement (M5S) 1 seat\n* South America: Centre-right coalition 2 seats, Centre-left coalition 1 seat\n* North and Central America: Centre-right coalition 1 seat, Centre-left coalition 1 seat\n* Africa, Asia, Oceania, and Antarctica: Centre-right coalition 1 seat\n\n## Senate of the Republic\n\n### Overall Results\n\nThe overall results for the Senate of the Republic were:\n\n* Centre-right coalition: 115 seats (42.2% of the vote)\n* Five Star Movement (M5S): 28 seats (15.6% of the vote)\n* Centre-left coalition: 44 seats (18.7% of the vote)\n* Free and Equal (LeU): 4 seats (3.3% of the vote)\n* More Europe (+Eu): 2 seats (2.5% of the vote)\n\n### Proportional and FPTP Results\n\nThe proportional and FPTP results for the Senate of the Republic were:\n\n* Proportional representation: Centre-right coalition 64 seats, Five Star Movement (M5S) 23 seats, Centre-left coalition 31 seats\n* FPTP voting: Centre-right coalition 51 seats, Five Star Movement (M5S) 5 seats, Centre-left coalition 13 seats\n\n### Aosta Valley\n\nThe results for the Aosta Valley constituency were:\n\n* Centre-right coalition: 1 seat (44.1% of the vote)\n* Centre-left coalition: 0 seats (30.6% of the vote)\n* Five Star Movement (M5S): 0 seats (14.2% of the vote)\n\n### Trentino-Alto Adige\n\nThe results for the Trentino-Alto Adige constituency were:\n\n* Centre-right coalition: 2 seats (43.8% of the vote)\n* Centre-left coalition: 1 seat (31.4% of the vote)\n* Five Star Movement (M5S): 0 seats (12.2% of the vote)\n\n### Overseas Constituencies\n\nThe results for the overseas constituencies were:\n\n* Europe: Centre-right coalition 1 seat, Centre-left coalition 1 seat\n* South America: Centre-right coalition 1 seat\n* North and Central America: Centre-right coalition 1 seat\n* Africa, Asia, Oceania, and Antarctica: Centre-right coalition 1 seat\n\n## Leaders' Races\n\nThe leaders of the main parties all won their seats in the election.

Neely, a 30-year-old African American man, was choked to death by Daniel Penny, a 24-year-old white man, on a subway train in Manhattan. The incident sparked widespread outrage and protests, with many calling for justice and an end to police brutality.\n\n# Incident\n\nOn May 1, 2023, Jordan Neely boarded a subway train in Manhattan, where he was reportedly acting erratically and causing a disturbance. Witnesses described Neely as being agitated and loud, but not violent. Daniel Penny, who was also on the train, approached Neely and attempted to calm him down. However, the situation escalated, and Penny ended up choking Neely to death.\n\nThe incident was captured on video by several witnesses, which showed Penny holding Neely in a chokehold for several minutes. Despite the efforts of bystanders to intervene, Penny refused to release Neely, even after he had lost consciousness. The video footage, which was widely shared on social media, sparked outrage and condemnation from the public.\n\n# People involved\n\n## Jordan Neely\n\nJordan Neely was a 30-year-old African American man who was born and raised in New York City.

Penny had no prior history of violence or crime, and his motives for attacking Neely are still unclear. Penny's lawyer has claimed that he was acting in self-defense, but many have disputed this claim, arguing that Penny's actions were excessive and unjustified.\n\n# Legal proceedings\n\nFollowing the incident, Daniel Penny was arrested and charged with second-degree manslaughter. Penny's lawyer has claimed that he will plead not guilty, and the case is expected to go to trial.\n\nThe investigation into Neely's death is ongoing, with the NYPD and the Manhattan District Attorney's office working to determine the circumstances surrounding the incident.

Neely's mother, who was present at the scene of the incident, has described her son as a loving and gentle person who was taken from her too soon.\n\n## Public officials and community\n\nPublic officials, including Mayor Eric Adams and NYPD Commissioner Keechant Sewell, have condemned the incident and promised a full investigation. Community leaders and activists have also spoken out, with many calling for greater accountability and transparency from law enforcement.\n\n## Journalists\n\nJournalists have played a crucial role in covering the incident, with many outlets providing in-depth analysis and commentary. The New York Times, The New York Post, and other major outlets have all covered the story, with many calling for greater scrutiny of law enforcement practices.\n\n## Protests\n\nProtests have erupted across New York City, with many calling for justice and an end to police brutality.

It explores the origins of the Minions and their encounter with a young Gru, who would eventually become their boss.\n\n#Plot\n\nThe film takes place in the 1970s, during the height of the disco era. The story revolves around a 12-year-old Gru, who dreams of becoming a supervillain. Gru is an outcast among his peers and is desperate to prove himself. He applies to join the Vicious 6, a group of elite villains, but is rejected due to his young age.\n\nMeanwhile, the Minions, led by Kevin, Stuart, and Bob, are searching for a new leader after their previous one abandoned them. They stumble upon Gru and decide to follow him, believing he has the potential to become a great villain.\n\nGru and the Minions embark on a series of misadventures, including a wild goose chase through San Francisco and a showdown with the Vicious 6. Along the way, Gru learns the value of friendship and teamwork, and the Minions discover their loyalty and dedication to their new leader.\n\n#Voice cast\n\nThe film features an all-star voice cast, including Steve Carell as Gru, Pierre Coffin as the Minions, and Alan Arkin as Wild Knuckles, a veteran villain and member of the Vicious 6. The cast also includes Taraji P. Henson as Belle Bottom, a sassy and seductive villain, and Michelle Yeoh as Master Chow, a martial arts expert and member of the Vicious 6.\n\n#Production\n\nMinions: The Rise of Gru was directed by Kyle Balda, who previously co-directed the first Minions film. The screenplay was written by Matthew Fogel, who also wrote the screenplay for the first film. The film was produced by Chris Renaud, Janet Healy, and Chris Meledandri.\n\nThe film's animation was created by Illumination Mac Guff, a French animation studio that has worked on several Illumination films. The studio used a combination of computer-generated imagery (CGI) and traditional animation techniques to create the film's colorful and stylized visuals.\n\n#Music\n\nThe film's soundtrack features a mix of classic disco hits and original songs. The soundtrack includes songs by artists such as the Bee Gees, Chic, and KC and the Sunshine Band. The film's score was composed by Heitor Pereira, who previously worked on the Despicable Me franchise.\n\n#Marketing and release\n\nMinions: The Rise of Gru was released in the United States on July 1, 2022. The film was originally scheduled for release in July 2020, but was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe film's marketing campaign included a series of trailers and TV spots, as well as promotional partnerships with brands such as McDonald's and General Mills. The film's social media campaign encouraged fans to share their own Minion-inspired content using the hashtag #MinionsRise.\n\n##Box office\n\nMinions: The Rise of Gru was a commercial success, grossing over $939 million worldwide. The film opened at number one in the United States, earning $107 million in its opening weekend. The film's success was driven by strong performances in international markets, particularly in China and the United Kingdom.\n\n##Critical response\n\nMinions: The Rise of Gru received generally positive reviews from critics. The film holds a 72% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 222 reviews. The critical consensus reads: \"Minions: The Rise of Gru is a fun and funny sequel that explores the origins of our favorite yellow creatures.\"\n\nSome critics praised the film's visuals and animation, while others noted that the story was predictable and formulaic. However, most critics agreed that the film's humor and charm made it an enjoyable watch.\n\n###Gentleminions TikTok trend\n\nDuring the film's opening weekend, a viral trend emerged on TikTok, in which groups of young men dressed in suits and sunglasses, mimicking the film's characters, attended screenings of the film. The trend, dubbed \"Gentleminions,\" was seen as a playful and ironic take on the film's themes of masculinity and villainy.\n\n##Accolades\n\nMinions: The Rise of Gru received several awards and nominations, including a nomination for Best Animated Feature at the 2023 Golden Globe Awards. The film also won several awards at the 2023 Kids' Choice Awards, including Favorite Animated Movie and Favorite Voice from an Animated Movie (Steve Carell).\n\n#Sequel\n\nA sequel to Minions: The Rise of Gru is currently in development, with Chris Renaud set to direct.

It is a complex and multifaceted system that combines elements of Platonism, Aristotelianism, Stoicism, and mysticism. Neoplatonism had a profound impact on Western philosophy, influencing the development of Christianity, Islam, and Judaism, as well as the intellectual and artistic movements of the Renaissance.\n\n#Origins of the term\n\nThe term \"Neoplatonism\" was coined in the 19th century to describe the philosophical and spiritual movement that emerged in the 3rd century AD. The term is derived from the Greek words \"neo\" (new) and \"Platonism\" (the philosophy of Plato). While the term is somewhat misleading, as Neoplatonism is not a direct continuation of Plato's philosophy, it has become the standard term used to describe this philosophical and spiritual movement.\n\n#Origins and history of classical Neoplatonism\n\n##Hellenism\n\nNeoplatonism emerged in the 3rd century AD, during the Hellenistic period, when Greek culture and philosophy were spreading throughout the Mediterranean world. This was a time of great cultural and intellectual ferment, with various philosophical schools, such as Stoicism, Epicureanism, and Platonism, vying for influence.\n\n##Ammonius Saccas\n\nThe origins of Neoplatonism can be traced back to Ammonius Saccas, an Egyptian philosopher who taught in Alexandria in the 2nd century AD. Ammonius was a Platonist, but he also incorporated elements of Aristotelianism and Stoicism into his teachings. He is said to have been the teacher of Plotinus, the founder of Neoplatonism.\n\n##Plotinus\n\nPlotinus (205-270 AD) is widely regarded as the founder of Neoplatonism. He was born in Lycopolis, Egypt, and studied philosophy in Alexandria under Ammonius Saccas. Plotinus' teachings were heavily influenced by Plato, but he also incorporated elements of Aristotelianism, Stoicism, and mysticism into his philosophy. He is best known for his Enneads, a collection of philosophical treatises that explore the nature of the universe and the human condition.\n\n##Porphyry\n\nPorphyry (234-305 AD) was a student of Plotinus and one of the most important Neoplatonist philosophers of the 3rd century AD. He is best known for his book \"Isagoge,\" which is a commentary on Aristotle's \"Categories.\" Porphyry's teachings had a significant impact on the development of Neoplatonism, particularly in the areas of metaphysics and epistemology.\n\n##Iamblichus\n\nIamblichus (245-325 AD) was a Neoplatonist philosopher who taught in Syria and Egypt. He is best known for his book \"On the Mysteries,\" which explores the nature of the universe and the human condition from a mystical perspective. Iamblichus' teachings had a significant impact on the development of Neoplatonism, particularly in the areas of theurgy and mysticism.\n\n##Academies\n\nThe Neoplatonist academies were institutions of higher learning that emerged in the 3rd century AD. These academies were centers of philosophical and spiritual inquiry, where students could study the teachings of Plotinus and other Neoplatonist philosophers. The most famous of these academies was the Academy of Athens, which was founded by Plato in the 4th century BC.\n\n##Hypatia\n\nHypatia (350-415 AD) was a Neoplatonist philosopher and mathematician who taught in Alexandria. She is best known for her teachings on the nature of the universe and the human condition, which were heavily influenced by Plotinus and other Neoplatonist philosophers. Hypatia's teachings had a significant impact on the development of Neoplatonism, particularly in the areas of metaphysics and epistemology.\n\n##Proclus\n\nProclus (412-485 AD) was a Neoplatonist philosopher who taught in Athens. He is best known for his commentaries on the works of Plato, which are still studied by scholars today. Proclus' teachings had a significant impact on the development of Neoplatonism, particularly in the areas of metaphysics and theurgy.\n\n#Ideas\n\nNeoplatonism is a complex and multifaceted system that combines elements of Platonism, Aristotelianism, Stoicism, and mysticism. The core ideas of Neoplatonism can be summarized as follows:\n\n##The One\n\nThe One is the ultimate reality and the source of all existence. It is the unchanging, eternal, and infinite source of all things. The One is beyond human comprehension and can only be approached through mystical experience.\n\n##Emanations\n\nThe Neoplatonists believed in a series of emanations from the One, which are the different levels of reality that make up the universe. These emanations are:\n\n###Demiurge or nous\n\nThe Demiurge or nous is the first emanation from the One. It is the divine mind or intellect that creates the universe and governs its operations.\n\n###World-soul\n\nThe World-soul is the second emanation from the One. It is the soul of the universe and is responsible for its animation and movement.\n\n###Phenomenal world\n\nThe phenomenal world is the third emanation from the One. It is the world of sensory experience and is characterized by change and flux.\n\n##Celestial hierarchy\n\nThe Neoplatonists believed in a celestial hierarchy of beings, which are the different levels of reality that make up the universe. These beings are:\n\n* The One\n* The Demiurge or nous\n* The World-soul\n* The angels and demons\n* The gods and goddesses\n* The humans\n\n##Evil\n\nThe Neoplatonists believed that evil is a privation of good and is not a positive reality. They believed that evil is caused by the ignorance and darkness of the human soul.\n\n##Return to the One\n\nThe ultimate goal of human existence is to return to the One, which is the source of all existence. This can be achieved through spiritual practices such as meditation, contemplation, and theurgy.\n\n#Influence\n\nNeoplatonism had a profound impact on Western philosophy, influencing the development of Christianity, Islam, and Judaism, as well as the intellectual and artistic movements of the Renaissance.\n\n##Early Christianity\n\nNeoplatonism had a significant impact on the development of early Christianity. Many of the early Christian theologians, such as Augustine and Origen, were influenced by Neoplatonist ideas.\n\n###Augustine\n\nAugustine (354-430 AD) was a Christian theologian who was heavily influenced by Neoplatonist ideas. His book \"Confessions\" is a classic example of Neoplatonist spirituality.\n\n###Origen and Pseudo-Dionysius\n\nOrigen (185-254 AD) was a Christian theologian who was influenced by Neoplatonist ideas. His book \"On First Principles\" is a classic example of Neoplatonist theology. Pseudo-Dionysius (c. 500 AD) was a Christian theologian who was influenced by Neoplatonist ideas. His book \"The Divine Names\" is a classic example of Neoplatonist mysticism.\n\n###Gnosticism\n\nGnosticism is a Christian heresy that emerged in the 2nd century AD. It is characterized by a Neoplatonist view of the universe and the human condition.\n\n##Byzantine education\n\nNeoplatonism had a significant impact on Byzantine education, particularly in the areas of philosophy and theology.\n\n##Islamic neoplatonism\n\nNeoplatonism had a significant impact on Islamic thought, particularly in the areas of philosophy and mysticism.\n\n##Jewish thought\n\nNeoplatonism had a significant impact on Jewish thought, particularly in the areas of philosophy and mysticism.\n\n##Medieval Christian Thought\n\nNeoplatonism had a significant impact on medieval Christian thought, particularly in the areas of philosophy and theology.\n\n##Western Renaissance\n\nNeoplatonism had a significant impact on the Western Renaissance, particularly in the areas of art, literature, and philosophy.\n\n##Cambridge Platonists (17th century)\n\nThe Cambridge Platonists were a group of philosophers who were influenced by Neoplatonist ideas. They are characterized by their emphasis on reason, tolerance, and individualism.\n\n##Modern neoplatonism\n\nNeoplatonism continues to influence modern thought, particularly in the areas of philosophy, spirituality, and ecology.\n\n#See also\n\n* Platonism\n* Aristotelianism\n* Stoicism\n* Mysticism\n* Gnosticism\n* Hermeticism\n* Theurgy\n* Mystical experience\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is a general overview of Neoplatonism and its ideas.

From its humble beginnings in school dramas and nativity scenes to the emergence of Ukrainian-language opera, the art form has faced numerous challenges and obstacles, yet continues to thrive to this day. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the development of opera in Ukraine, from its origins to the present day.\n\nOrigins\n--------\n\nThe earliest forms of opera in Ukraine date back to the 17th century, with the development of two distinct genres: school dramas and nativity scenes.\n\n### Shkilʹna dramy (school dramas)\n\nShkilʹna dramy, also known as school dramas, emerged in the 17th century as a form of theatrical performance in Ukrainian schools. These dramas were typically performed by students and were based on biblical stories, folk tales, and historical events. They often featured music, singing, and dancing, laying the groundwork for the development of opera in Ukraine.\n\n### Vertepy (nativity scenes)\n\nVertepy, or nativity scenes, were another early form of opera in Ukraine. These performances reenacted the story of the Nativity and were typically performed during the Christmas season. They featured music, singing, and acting, and were often performed by amateur groups.\n\n### Vaudeville\n\nIn the 18th century, vaudeville became a popular form of entertainment in Ukraine. Vaudeville was a type of variety show that featured music, dance, and comedy. It was often performed in theaters and was a major influence on the development of opera in Ukraine.\n\nOperetta\n---------\n\nOperetta, a form of light opera, emerged in Ukraine in the late 19th century. Operetta was characterized by its witty dialogue, catchy music, and comedic storylines. It was a popular form of entertainment in Ukraine, particularly in the cities of Kyiv and Lviv.\n\nObstacles to the development of Ukrainian-language opera\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nDespite the growth of opera in Ukraine, the development of Ukrainian-language opera faced numerous obstacles. One major challenge was the lack of a Ukrainian-language opera tradition. Ukrainian opera was heavily influenced by European opera, particularly Italian and German opera, and many Ukrainian composers were educated in European conservatories.\n\nAnother major challenge was the lack of state support for Ukrainian-language opera. The Russian Empire, which ruled Ukraine at the time, actively suppressed Ukrainian culture and language, making it difficult for Ukrainian composers to create and perform operas in their native language.\n\nEmergence of Ukrainian opera\n---------------------------\n\nDespite these challenges, Ukrainian-language opera began to emerge in the late 19th century.\n\n### Mykola Lysenko\n\nMykola Lysenko (1842-1912) is considered the father of Ukrainian opera. Lysenko was a composer, pianist, and conductor who was instrumental in the development of Ukrainian-language opera. He composed several operas, including \"Taras Bulba\" and \"Natalka Poltavka,\" which are still performed today.\n\n### Lysenko's contemporaries and successors\n\nLysenko's contemporaries and successors, including composers such as Mykola Leontovych and Kyrylo Stetsenko, continued to develop Ukrainian-language opera. They composed operas on Ukrainian themes and topics, using Ukrainian folk music and language.\n\nPeriod of resurgence\n-------------------\n\nThe early 20th century saw a period of resurgence in Ukrainian opera, particularly in the 1910s and 1920s.\n\n### 1910s\n\nThe 1910s saw a surge in interest in Ukrainian culture and language, particularly among the Ukrainian intelligentsia. This led to an increase in the number of Ukrainian-language operas being composed and performed.\n\n### 1920s and early 1930s\n\nThe 1920s and early 1930s saw a flowering of Ukrainian culture, including opera. Many Ukrainian composers, including Leontovych and Stetsenko, composed operas during this period.\n\n#### Historical opera\n\nHistorical opera became a popular genre during this period. Historical operas were based on Ukrainian historical events and figures, such as the Cossack leader Bohdan Khmelnytsky.\n\nStalinism (1932-1956)\n-------------------\n\nThe Stalin era saw a significant decline in Ukrainian culture, including opera. Many Ukrainian composers were persecuted, arrested, or forced into exile.\n\n### World War II\n\nDuring World War II, Ukraine was devastated, and many opera houses and theaters were destroyed.\n\n### 1945-1953\n\nAfter the war, the Soviet Union attempted to rebuild Ukrainian culture, including opera. However, the government tightly controlled the arts, and many Ukrainian composers were forced to conform to Soviet ideology.\n\n1953-1991\n---------\n\nThe post-Stalin era saw a gradual relaxation of government control over the arts.\n\n### 1953-1970\n\nThe 1950s and 1960s saw a renewal of interest in Ukrainian culture, including opera. Many Ukrainian composers, including Valentyn Silvestrov and Leonid Hrabovsky, composed operas during this period.\n\n### 1970s\n\nThe 1970s saw a surge in interest in Ukrainian folk music and language, particularly among young people. This led to an increase in the number of Ukrainian-language operas being composed and performed.\n\n### 1980s\n\nThe 1980s saw a significant increase in cultural freedom in Ukraine, particularly with the advent of glasnost and perestroika. Many Ukrainian composers were able to compose and perform operas without government interference.\n\nPost-independence operas\n----------------------\n\nSince Ukraine gained independence in 1991, there has been a significant increase in the number of Ukrainian-language operas being composed and performed. Many Ukrainian composers, including Silvestrov and Hrabovsky, continue to compose operas on Ukrainian themes and topics.\n\nOpera houses\n------------\n\nThere are several major opera houses in Ukraine, including the National Opera of Ukraine in Kyiv and the Lviv Opera and Ballet Theatre. These opera houses perform a wide range of operas, including Ukrainian-language operas.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nNotes\n\nCitations\n\nSources\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Opera_in_Ukraine\" following this outline:\n\n#Origins\n##Shkilʹna dramy (school dramas)\n##Vertepy (nativity scenes)\n##Vaudeville\n#Operetta\n#Obstacles to the development of Ukrainian-language opera\n#Emergence of Ukrainian opera\n##Mykola Lysenko\n##Lysenko's contemporaries and successors\n#Period of resurgence\n##1910s\n##1920s and early 1930s\n###Historical opera\n#Stalinism (1932–1956)\n##World War II\n##1945–1953\n#1953–1991\n##1953–1970\n##1970s\n##1980s\n#Post-independence operas\n#Opera houses\n#References\n##Notes\n##Citations\n##Sources\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

His life was marked by a passion for exploration, innovation, and a drive to push the boundaries of human knowledge.\n\n# Early life\n\nStockton Rush was born on June 27, 1962, in the United States. Growing up in a family that valued education and exploration, Rush developed an early interest in science, technology, and the natural world. He spent much of his childhood reading about the great explorers and scientists of history, and he became fascinated with the potential of technology to unlock the secrets of the universe.\n\nRush's parents encouraged his curiosity, providing him with opportunities to engage in hands-on learning experiences. He spent hours building models, conducting experiments, and exploring the outdoors. As he grew older, Rush's interests began to focus on the fields of engineering and physics, and he went on to study these subjects in college.\n\n## Education\n\nRush earned a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of California, Berkeley. During his time at Berkeley, he was an active member of the university's engineering community, participating in various projects and competitions that allowed him to apply theoretical concepts to real-world problems.\n\nAfter completing his undergraduate degree, Rush went on to earn a Master's degree in Aerospace Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). At MIT, he was part of a research team that focused on the development of advanced materials and technologies for use in space exploration.\n\n# Career\n\nRush's professional career spanned multiple industries, including aerospace, energy, and finance. He worked for several high-profile companies, including NASA, where he was involved in the development of advanced propulsion systems for spacecraft.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Rush began to focus on the field of renewable energy, recognizing the potential for innovative technologies to transform the way that humans generate and consume power. He went on to co-found a company that specialized in the development of advanced solar energy systems, and he played a key role in the design and implementation of several large-scale renewable energy projects.\n\n## Entrepreneurship\n\nRush was a successful entrepreneur, with a track record of launching and growing innovative companies. He was known for his ability to identify emerging trends and opportunities, and he was willing to take calculated risks to pursue his vision.\n\nIn addition to his work in the renewable energy sector, Rush was also involved in various other business ventures, including a company that specialized in the development of advanced materials for use in aerospace and defense applications.\n\n# Titan expedition and death\n\nIn 2023, Rush joined the Titan submersible expedition to the wreck of the RMS Titanic. The expedition was a privately funded venture that aimed to explore the Titanic wreck site using advanced submersible technology.\n\nRush was part of a team that included experienced explorers, scientists, and engineers. The team used a state-of-the-art submersible vessel to reach the Titanic wreck site, which lies at a depth of approximately 12,500 feet in the North Atlantic Ocean.\n\nOn June 18, 2023, Rush and his team made history by becoming the first people to reach the Titanic wreck site in a submersible vessel. The expedition was a major success, providing new insights into the history of the Titanic and the marine ecosystem of the North Atlantic.\n\nTragically, Rush lost his life during the expedition when the submersible vessel imploded while returning to the surface. The incident occurred on June 18, 2023, and Rush was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\n## Investigation\n\nAn investigation into the incident was launched by the relevant authorities, and the cause of the submersible vessel's implosion is still under review. The incident highlights the risks and challenges involved in deep-sea exploration, and it serves as a reminder of the sacrifices that explorers like Stockton Rush make in pursuit of knowledge and discovery.\n\n# Personal life\n\nRush was a private person who preferred to keep a low profile. However, he was known to be a passionate advocate for STEM education and innovation, and he was involved in various initiatives that aimed to promote these values.\n\nRush was also an avid outdoorsman and adventurer, with a love for hiking, skiing, and other outdoor pursuits. He was a licensed pilot and enjoyed flying in his free time.\n\n## Legacy\n\nStockton Rush's legacy is one of innovation, exploration, and a passion for discovery. He will be remembered as a true pioneer, who pushed the boundaries of human knowledge and inspired others to do the same.\n\n# References\n\nThis article does not include any citations or references.\n\n# External links\n\nThis article does not include any external links.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Stockton_Rush\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n#Career\n#Titan expedition and death\n#Personal life\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The documents provide insight into Twitter's content moderation policies, relationships with government agencies, and handling of high-profile accounts. The release of the Twitter Files has sparked controversy and debate among politicians, journalists, and the public.\n\nBackground\n-----------\n\nThe Twitter Files were released by Elon Musk, who acquired Twitter in October 2022. Musk has been a vocal critic of Twitter's content moderation policies and has pledged to increase transparency on the platform. The documents were released through a series of tweets by Musk and independent journalist Matt Taibbi, who was given access to the documents by Musk.\n\nTopics\n-------\n\nThe Twitter Files cover a range of topics related to Twitter's internal operations and content moderation policies.\n\n### No. 1: Content moderation of New York Post story\n\nThe first installment of the Twitter Files revealed internal discussions among Twitter employees about the decision to block a New York Post story about Hunter Biden's laptop in October 2020. The story was blocked by Twitter due to concerns about its veracity and potential violation of Twitter's hacked materials policy. However, the documents show that many Twitter employees were unsure about the decision and questioned whether it was an overreach of the platform's moderation policies.\n\n### No. 2: Visibility filtering\n\nThe second installment of the Twitter Files revealed that Twitter had a system of \"visibility filtering\" that allowed the platform to reduce the visibility of certain tweets and accounts without explicitly suspending or removing them. This system was used to reduce the visibility of tweets from conservative and libertarian accounts, according to the documents.\n\n### Nos. 3–5: Attack on the Capitol and suspension of Donald Trump\n\nThe third, fourth, and fifth installments of the Twitter Files revealed internal discussions among Twitter employees about the January 6, 2021, attack on the United States Capitol and the subsequent suspension of Donald Trump's Twitter account. The documents show that Twitter employees were deeply concerned about the potential for violence and misinformation on the platform, but also struggled with the decision to suspend Trump's account, which was seen as a drastic measure.\n\n### Nos. 6–7: FBI communications with Twitter Trust and Safety Team\n\nThe sixth and seventh installments of the Twitter Files revealed communications between the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Twitter's Trust and Safety Team. The documents show that the FBI regularly communicated with Twitter about potential threats and misinformation on the platform, and that Twitter often took action based on the FBI's requests.\n\n### Nos. 8–9: Relationship with the U.S. government\n\nThe eighth and ninth installments of the Twitter Files revealed more about Twitter's relationship with the U.S. government, including regular meetings and communications with government agencies. The documents show that Twitter has a complex and multifaceted relationship with the government, with both cooperation and tension between the two.\n\n### No. 10: Moderation of COVID-19 content\n\nThe tenth installment of the Twitter Files revealed internal discussions among Twitter employees about the moderation of COVID-19 content on the platform. The documents show that Twitter struggled to balance the need to reduce misinformation with the need to allow for free and open discussion about the pandemic.\n\n### No. 15: Hamilton 68 Dashboard\n\nThe fifteenth installment of the Twitter Files revealed more about the Hamilton 68 Dashboard, a tool created by the Alliance for Securing Democracy to track Russian propaganda on Twitter. The documents show that the dashboard was widely used by Twitter employees, but also raised concerns about its methodology and potential biases.\n\n### No. 16: Insults directed to and from Donald Trump and other Republicans\n\nThe sixteenth installment of the Twitter Files revealed internal discussions among Twitter employees about insults directed to and from Donald Trump and other Republicans. The documents show that Twitter employees often struggled with how to handle these types of tweets, which were seen as potentially inflammatory and divisive.\n\n### No. 17: Global Engagement Center\n\nThe seventeenth installment of the Twitter Files revealed more about the Global Engagement Center, a U.S. government agency that works to counter foreign propaganda and disinformation. The documents show that Twitter has a close relationship with the center, which provides the platform with information and guidance on how to handle foreign propaganda.\n\n### No. 19: The Virality Project\n\nThe nineteenth installment of the Twitter Files revealed more about the Virality Project, a research initiative that studies the spread of misinformation on social media. The documents show that Twitter has worked closely with the project, which has provided the platform with valuable insights into the spread of misinformation.\n\nReactions\n----------\n\nThe release of the Twitter Files has sparked a range of reactions from politicians, journalists, and the public.\n\n### Politicians\n\nMany politicians have weighed in on the Twitter Files, with some calling for greater transparency and accountability from the platform. Others have defended Twitter's content moderation policies, arguing that they are necessary to protect users from harassment and misinformation.\n\n### FBI\n\nThe FBI has not commented directly on the Twitter Files, but has stated that it works closely with social media companies to identify and disrupt potential threats.\n\n### Legal scholars\n\nLegal scholars have been divided on the implications of the Twitter Files, with some arguing that they raise important questions about the limits of social media companies' power to moderate content. Others have argued that the files demonstrate the need for greater regulation of social media companies.\n\n### Privacy and security\n\nPrivacy and security experts have raised concerns about the potential risks of the Twitter Files, including the potential for sensitive information to be exposed. They have also argued that the files demonstrate the need for greater transparency and accountability from social media companies.\n\n### Former Twitter CEO\n\nFormer Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has defended the company's content moderation policies, arguing that they are necessary to protect users from harassment and misinformation. He has also stated that the Twitter Files demonstrate the need for greater transparency and accountability from the platform.\n\n### Journalists\n\nJournalists have been divided on the implications of the Twitter Files, with some arguing that they raise important questions about the limits of social media companies' power to moderate content.

The storm caused widespread damage, flooding, and loss of life, particularly in Libya, where it led to one of the country's worst natural disasters in recent history.\n\n# Meteorological history\n\nStorm Daniel formed as a low-pressure system over the eastern Mediterranean Sea on September 5, 2023. The system rapidly intensified into a Mediterranean cyclone, fueled by warm sea surface temperatures and a strong jet stream. As the storm moved eastward, it brought strong winds, heavy rainfall, and rough seas to several countries in the region.\n\nThe storm's track took it over the island of Crete, Greece, before moving eastward towards the coast of Turkey. From there, it turned southward and made landfall in Libya, where it caused catastrophic damage and flooding. The storm then moved westward, affecting parts of Egypt and Israel before dissipating on September 12, 2023.\n\n# Impact\n\n## Greece\n\nStorm Daniel brought strong winds and heavy rainfall to several parts of Greece, particularly the island of Crete. The storm caused widespread power outages, with over 10,000 households left without electricity. Flooding was also reported in several areas, with the city of Heraklion being particularly affected.\n\nDespite the severe weather conditions, no fatalities were reported in Greece. However, the storm caused significant damage to buildings, roads, and agricultural land. The Greek government declared a state of emergency in several regions and deployed military personnel to assist with relief efforts.\n\n## Turkey\n\nTurkey was also affected by Storm Daniel, with strong winds and heavy rainfall reported in several provinces.

However, the storm caused significant damage to buildings, roads, and agricultural land. The Bulgarian government deployed emergency services to assist with relief efforts.\n\n## Libya\n\n### Preparations\n\nLibyan authorities were aware of the approaching storm and took steps to prepare for its impact. The Libyan National Meteorological Center issued warnings and alerts, and the government declared a state of emergency in several regions.\n\nHowever, despite these efforts, the storm caught many people off guard. The Libyan government had not conducted any evacuations, and many people were not aware of the severity of the storm.\n\n### Derna dam failures\n\nThe storm caused catastrophic damage to the city of Derna, where two dams failed, releasing massive amounts of water into the city. The resulting floods swept away buildings, cars, and people, causing widespread destruction and loss of life.\n\nThe Derna dam failures were one of the worst natural disasters in Libya's recent history, with thousands of people left dead or missing. The Libyan government declared a state of emergency in the city, and international aid teams were deployed to assist with relief efforts.\n\n### Other areas\n\nIn addition to Derna, other areas of Libya were also affected by the storm, including the cities of Benghazi and Bayda. The storm caused widespread power outages, flooding, and damage to buildings and roads.\n\n### Nationwide impact\n\nThe storm had a nationwide impact on Libya, with many areas affected by flooding, power outages, and damage to infrastructure.

This system is designed to increase voter choice and reduce the influence of party politics. In this article, we will explore the usage, benefits, drawbacks, and variations of top-four primaries.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n### Top-four\n\nTop-four primaries have been adopted in a few states in the United States. Two notable examples are Alaska and Missouri.\n\n#### Alaska\n\nIn 2020, Alaska adopted a top-four primary system for state and federal elections. The system was implemented in response to a ballot initiative that aimed to increase voter choice and reduce partisanship. Under the system, the top four candidates in the primary election advance to the general election, regardless of party affiliation.\n\n#### Missouri\n\nMissouri also adopted a top-four primary system in 2020, but it only applies to state legislative and congressional elections. The system was implemented through a ballot initiative that aimed to reduce partisanship and increase voter choice.\n\n### Top-five\n\nWhile top-four primaries are still rare, a few states have adopted top-five primary systems. One notable example is Nevada.\n\n#### Nevada\n\nNevada adopted a top-five primary system in 2020 for state and federal elections. The system is similar to the top-four primary system, but it allows the top five candidates to advance to the general election. The system was implemented through a ballot initiative that aimed to increase voter choice and reduce partisanship.\n\nBenefits\n--------\n\nTop-four primaries have several benefits, including increased voter choice and reduced partisanship.\n\nBy allowing the top four candidates to advance to the general election, regardless of party affiliation, top-four primaries increase voter choice. Voters are no longer limited to choosing between two major party candidates, but can instead choose from a broader range of options.\n\nTop-four primaries also reduce partisanship by allowing candidates from different parties to compete against each other. This can lead to more civil and issue-based campaigns, rather than partisan attacks.\n\nDrawbacks\n----------\n\nWhile top-four primaries have several benefits, they also have some drawbacks.\n\n### Vote splitting\n\nOne of the main drawbacks of top-four primaries is vote splitting. When multiple candidates from the same party run in the primary election, they can split the vote and allow a candidate from a different party to advance to the general election. This can lead to unintended consequences, such as a candidate winning the primary election with a small percentage of the vote.\n\n#### Primary\n\nVote splitting can occur in the primary election when multiple candidates from the same party run against each other. For example, if three Democratic candidates run in the primary election, they may split the Democratic vote and allow a Republican candidate to advance to the general election.\n\n#### General\n\nVote splitting can also occur in the general election when multiple candidates from the same party run against each other. For example, if two Democratic candidates and two Republican candidates run in the general election, they may split the vote and allow a third-party candidate to win the election.\n\n### Voter deception\n\nAnother drawback of top-four primaries is voter deception. When candidates are not required to disclose their party affiliation, voters may be deceived into voting for a candidate who does not share their values.\n\nVariations\n----------\n\nWhile top-four primaries are still rare, there are several variations of the system.\n\n### Final Five Voting\n\nFinal Five Voting is a variation of the top-four primary system that allows voters to rank their top five candidates in the primary election. The top five candidates then advance to the general election, where voters can rank their top three candidates. The candidate with the most first-choice votes wins the election.\n\n### Primary\n\nIn some states, the top-four primary system only applies to the primary election. In these states, the top four candidates advance to a runoff election, where the top two candidates compete against each other.\n\n### Post-primary\n\nIn some states, the top-four primary system only applies to the post-primary election. In these states, the top four candidates advance to a runoff election, where the top two candidates compete against each other.\n\n### General\n\nIn some states, the top-four primary system only applies to the general election. In these states, the top four candidates compete against each other in the general election, and the candidate with the most votes wins the election.\n\n### Summary\n\nIn summary, top-four primaries have several benefits, including increased voter choice and reduced partisanship. However, they also have some drawbacks, including vote splitting and voter deception. There are several variations of the system, including Final Five Voting, primary-runoff systems, and general election systems.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Instant-runoff voting\n* Ranked-choice voting\n* Top-two primary\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n* (Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)\n\nExternal links\n---------------\n\n* (Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Top-four_primary\" following this outline:\n\n#Usage\n##Top-four\n###Alaska\n###Missouri\n##Top-five\n###Nevada\n#Benefits\n#Drawbacks\n##Vote splitting\n###Primary\n###General\n##Voter deception\n#Variations\n##Final Five Voting\n##Primary\n##Post-primary\n##General\n##Summary\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Turkey has been a key player in the international coalition against ISIS, and has launched numerous military operations against the group in Syria and Iraq. However, the conflict has also had a significant impact on Turkey's domestic security, with ISIS launching numerous attacks on Turkish soil. The most notable of these was the 2015 Suruç bombing, which killed 33 people, and the 2016 Istanbul Atatürk Airport attack, which killed 45 people.\n\n## PKK-Turkey conflict\n\nTurkey has also been involved in a decades-long conflict with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a Kurdish separatist organization that has been designated as a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States, and the European Union. The conflict has resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people, and has had a significant impact on Turkey's domestic security. The PKK has launched numerous attacks on Turkish soil, including the 2015 Ankara bombings, which killed 109 people.\n\n# Bombing\n\nThe bombing occurred on November 13, 2022, at around 4:20 pm local time, on Istiklal Avenue in the Beyoğlu district of Istanbul. The avenue is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Istanbul, and is lined with shops, restaurants, and cafes. The bomb was detonated on a crowded stretch of the avenue, near the intersection with Taksim Square. The blast was powerful, and caused significant damage to nearby buildings and vehicles.\n\n# Victims\n\nSix people were killed in the bombing, including two children. A total of 81 people were injured, including 12 who were seriously hurt. The victims were from a variety of countries, including Turkey, the United States, Germany, and Saudi Arabia.\n\n# Investigation\n\n## State investigation\n\nThe Turkish government launched an immediate investigation into the bombing, with the Interior Ministry announcing that it had established a special task force to investigate the attack. The task force was led by the Istanbul Police Department, and included representatives from the Turkish intelligence agency, the National Intelligence Organization (MİT). The investigation focused on determining the identity of the perpetrators and the motives behind the attack.\n\n## Kurdish forces denials and investigation\n\nThe PKK and its affiliates denied any involvement in the bombing, with the PKK's military wing, the People's Defense Forces (HPG), releasing a statement condemning the attack and expressing condolences to the victims. The HPG also announced that it had launched its own investigation into the bombing, and would cooperate with the Turkish authorities to determine the perpetrators.\n\n## MHP connection\n\nThe Turkish government's investigation focused on a woman named Ahlam Albashir, who was identified as a suspect in the bombing. Albashir was a Syrian national who had entered Turkey in 2019, and had been living in Istanbul at the time of the bombing. The investigation revealed that Albashir had ties to the MHP, a far-right Turkish nationalist party that has been linked to extremist groups in the past.\n\n## Other events\n\nThe bombing was followed by a series of other events that were linked to the investigation. On November 17, 2022, Turkish police arrested 17 people in connection with the bombing, including several members of the MHP. The arrests were made in a series of raids across Istanbul, and were announced by the Turkish Interior Ministry. On November 20, 2022, the Turkish government announced that it had identified the perpetrator of the bombing as Ahlam Albashir, and that she had been acting on behalf of the MHP.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe bombing had a significant impact on Turkey's domestic security, with the government announcing a series of new measures to increase security in public places. The measures included the deployment of additional police officers to tourist areas, and the installation of new security cameras and metal detectors.\n\n# Internal reactions\n\n## Government politicians\n\nThe Turkish government was quick to condemn the bombing, with President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan releasing a statement expressing his condolences to the victims and their families. Erdoğan also announced that the Turkish government would do everything in its power to bring the perpetrators to justice. Other government politicians, including the Prime Minister and the Interior Minister, also released statements condemning the bombing and vowing to increase security measures.\n\n## Opposition\n\nThe Turkish opposition was also quick to condemn the bombing, with the leader of the main opposition party, the Republican People's Party (CHP), releasing a statement expressing his condolences to the victims and their families. The CHP leader also called for increased security measures and for the government to do more to address the root causes of terrorism.\n\n## Civil reactions\n\nThe bombing was widely condemned by Turkish civil society, with many organizations and individuals releasing statements expressing their condolences to the victims and their families. The bombing was also widely discussed on social media, with many people calling for increased security measures and for the government to do more to address the root causes of terrorism.\n\n# International reactions\n\nThe bombing was widely condemned by the international community, with many countries releasing statements expressing their condolences to the victims and their families. The United States, the European Union, and the United Nations all released statements condemning the bombing and vowing to support Turkey in its efforts to combat terrorism.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of terrorist incidents in Turkey\n* List of terrorist incidents linked to the Islamic State\n* List of terrorist incidents linked to the Kurdistan Workers' Party", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Istanbul_bombing\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Islamic State-Turkey conflict\n##PKK-Turkey conflict\n#Bombing\n#Victims\n#Investigation\n##State investigation\n##Kurdish forces denials and investigation\n##MHP connection\n##Other events\n#Aftermath\n#Internal reactions\n##Government politicians\n##Opposition\n##Civil reactions\n#International reactions\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

However, this article will focus on the major escalation of the conflict that started in February 2022. The invasion has resulted in significant loss of life, displacement of people, and widespread destruction of infrastructure.\n\n# Prelude\n\nThe roots of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine date back to the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. Ukraine declared its independence, while Russia sought to maintain its influence over the region. In 2014, a pro-Russian president was ousted in Ukraine, leading to the annexation of Crimea by Russia and the start of a conflict in eastern Ukraine.\n\nIn the years leading up to the 2022 invasion, tensions between Russia and Ukraine continued to escalate. Russia began to amass troops along the border with Ukraine, and in December 2021, the US and other Western countries warned of a potential Russian invasion. In January 2022, Russia launched a series of military exercises near the border, further raising concerns of an invasion.\n\n# Initial invasion\n\nOn February 24, 2022, Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine. The invasion began with a series of missile strikes and artillery bombardments across the country, followed by a ground invasion from multiple directions. The initial targets of the invasion were major cities, including Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Odesa.\n\nThe first few days of the invasion saw intense fighting, with both sides suffering heavy losses. Ukraine's military put up a strong resistance, but Russia's superior numbers and firepower began to take its toll. By the end of February, Russian forces had made significant gains, capturing several key cities and territories.\n\n## Kyiv campaign\n\nOne of the primary objectives of the Russian invasion was to capture Kyiv, the capital city of Ukraine. Russian forces advanced on the city from the north, but were met with fierce resistance from Ukrainian troops. The fighting was intense, with both sides suffering heavy losses.\n\nDespite being outnumbered and outgunned, Ukrainian forces managed to hold off the Russian advance, and by the end of March, the Russians had been pushed back from the city. The failure to capture Kyiv was a significant blow to Russia's plans, and marked a turning point in the conflict.\n\n# Southeastern front\n\nAs the invasion progressed, Russian forces began to focus on the southeastern region of Ukraine. The primary objective was to capture the city of Mariupol, which was a strategic port city on the Sea of Azov.\n\n## Battle of Mariupol\n\nThe battle for Mariupol was one of the bloodiest and most destructive of the conflict. Russian forces surrounded the city and subjected it to a prolonged bombardment, causing widespread destruction and loss of life.\n\nDespite being heavily outnumbered and outgunned, Ukrainian forces managed to hold out for several weeks, but eventually, the city fell to the Russians. The capture of Mariupol gave Russia control of the Sea of Azov and allowed them to establish a land bridge to Crimea.\n\n# 2022 Ukrainian counteroffensives\n\nAs the Russian advance slowed, Ukraine launched a series of counteroffensives to retake lost territory. The counteroffensives were successful, and by the summer of 2022, Ukraine had retaken several key cities and territories.\n\n## Kharkiv counteroffensive\n\nOne of the most significant counteroffensives was launched in the Kharkiv region. Ukrainian forces pushed the Russians back and recaptured several key cities, including Izium and Kupiansk. The counteroffensive was a significant blow to Russia's plans and marked a turning point in the conflict.\n\n# Second stalemate\n\nBy the fall of 2022, the conflict had reached a stalemate. Both sides had suffered heavy losses, and the front lines had stabilized. Russia had failed to achieve its objectives, but Ukraine had been unable to retake all of the lost territory.\n\n## Winter campaign\n\nAs the winter of 2022 approached, both sides began to prepare for a new phase of the conflict. Russia launched a series of missile strikes and artillery bombardments, while Ukraine prepared to launch a new counteroffensive.\n\n# 2023 Ukrainian counteroffensive\n\nIn the spring of 2023, Ukraine launched a new counteroffensive to retake lost territory. The counteroffensive was successful, and by the summer, Ukraine had retaken several key cities and territories.\n\n## Bakhmut campaign\n\nOne of the most significant battles of the counteroffensive was the battle for Bakhmut. Ukrainian forces pushed the Russians back and recaptured the city, which had been a key stronghold for the Russians.\n\n# Second winter campaign\n\nAs the winter of 2023 approached, both sides began to prepare for a new phase of the conflict. Russia launched a series of missile strikes and artillery bombardments, while Ukraine prepared to launch a new counteroffensive.\n\n# See also\n\n* Russo-Ukrainian War\n* Russian annexation of Crimea\n* War in Donbas\n* 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* List of military equipment used by Russian forces during the 2022 invasion of Ukraine\n* List of military equipment used by Ukrainian forces during the 2022 invasion\n\n# References\n\n*Note: No references are provided in this article*\n\n# External links\n\n*Note: No external links are provided in this article*", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Timeline_of_the_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine\" following this outline:\n\n#Prelude\n#Initial invasion\n#Southeastern front\n#2022 Ukrainian counteroffensives\n#Second stalemate\n#2023 Ukrainian counteroffensive\n#Second winter campaign\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The Boeing 737-800 aircraft, registration B-1791, was flying from Kunming Changshui International Airport to Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport when it suddenly dived and crashed into a hillside in Wuzhou County, killing all 132 people on board.\n\n# Flight\n\nFlight 5735 departed Kunming Changshui International Airport at 1:16 PM local time and was scheduled to arrive at Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport at 3:05 PM. The flight was crewed by three experienced pilots, and there were 123 passengers on board, including three children. The flight was operated by a Boeing 737-800, a narrow-body, twin-engine jet airliner.\n\n## Background\n\nChina Eastern Airlines is one of China's major airlines, with a fleet of over 700 aircraft and a network of domestic and international routes. The airline has a strong safety record, with no major incidents in recent years. The Boeing 737-800 is a widely used aircraft, known for its reliability and safety features.\n\n## Aircraft\n\nThe aircraft involved in the crash, registration B-1791, was a Boeing 737-800 with a serial number of 41445. It was delivered to China Eastern Airlines in June 2015 and had been in service for nearly seven years. The aircraft had accumulated over 18,000 hours of flight time and had undergone regular maintenance checks.\n\n## Passengers and crew\n\nThere were 132 people on board the flight, including 123 passengers and 9 crew members. The passengers included Chinese nationals, as well as a few foreigners. The crew consisted of three experienced pilots, including Captain Chen Zhengping, First Officer Zhang Zhengping, and Second Officer Ni Tingting.\n\n# Emergency response and recovery\n\nThe crash site was located in a remote, mountainous area, making it difficult for emergency responders to access. Local authorities and emergency responders were quickly deployed to the scene, and a search and rescue operation was launched. The Chinese government dispatched a team of experts to the crash site to assist in the recovery efforts.\n\nThe recovery operation was challenging due to the difficult terrain and the severity of the crash. However, the authorities were able to recover the black boxes, which were sent to Beijing for analysis. The wreckage of the aircraft was also recovered, and the remains of the passengers and crew were identified and returned to their families.\n\n# Investigation\n\nThe investigation into the crash was led by the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), with assistance from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) of the United States.\n\n## Initial investigation\n\nThe initial investigation focused on gathering evidence and data from the crash site. The authorities recovered the flight data recorder (FDR) and the cockpit voice recorder (CVR), which were sent to Beijing for analysis. The FDR contained data on the aircraft's flight path, speed, and altitude, while the CVR captured the conversations between the pilots and air traffic control.\n\n## Preliminary report\n\nThe CAAC released a preliminary report on the crash in April 2022, which provided an overview of the flight's history and the circumstances of the crash. The report stated that the aircraft had been climbing normally when it suddenly dived and crashed into the mountain.\n\n## Media reports of the investigation\n\nMedia reports suggested that the investigation was focusing on possible mechanical failure or pilot error. However, the authorities have not released any official information on the cause of the crash.\n\n## Interim report\n\nThe CAAC released an interim report on the crash in June 2022, which provided more detailed information on the investigation's findings. The report stated that the aircraft's engines had been functioning normally, and that there was no evidence of mechanical failure. The report also stated that the pilots had been experienced and well-trained.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## Domestic\n\nThe crash was met with shock and sadness in China, with many people expressing condolences to the families of the victims. The Chinese government pledged to conduct a thorough investigation and to take measures to prevent similar accidents in the future.\n\n## International\n\nThe international community also expressed condolences to the families of the victims. The United States, Canada, and other countries offered assistance to the Chinese authorities in the investigation.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of accidents and incidents involving commercial aircraft\n* List of China Eastern Airlines destinations\n* Boeing 737-800\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a factual account of the China Eastern Airlines Flight 5735 crash.

The committee is composed of nine members, with seven Democrats and two Republicans. The committee's investigation aims to uncover the facts surrounding the attack, identify the causes and consequences, and make recommendations to prevent similar events in the future.\n\n# History\n\nThe January 6 United States Capitol attack occurred on January 6, 2021, when a mob of supporters of then-President Donald Trump stormed the United States Capitol in an attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election results. The attack resulted in the deaths of five people, including a police officer, and injuries to many others. In the aftermath of the attack, there were widespread calls for an investigation into the events leading up to and during the attack.\n\nIn June 2021, the U.S. House of Representatives voted to establish a select committee to investigate the January 6 attack. The committee was established with bipartisan support, with 220 Democrats and 190 Republicans voting in favor of the resolution. However, 21 Republicans voted against the resolution, citing concerns about the committee's jurisdiction and the potential for partisan politics to influence the investigation.\n\n# Members\n\nThe select committee is composed of nine members, with seven Democrats and two Republicans. The members are:\n\n* Bennie Thompson (D-MS), Chair\n* Zoe Lofgren (D-CA)\n* Adam Schiff (D-CA)\n* Pete Aguilar (D-CA)\n* Stephanie Murphy (D-FL)\n* Jamie Raskin (D-MD)\n* Elaine Luria (D-VA)\n* Liz Cheney (R-WY)\n* Adam Kinzinger (R-IL)\n\n# Investigation\n\nThe select committee's investigation is focused on uncovering the facts surrounding the January 6 attack, including the events leading up to the attack, the attack itself, and the response to the attack. The committee has held numerous public hearings and has issued subpoenas to several individuals, including former Trump administration officials and Republican lawmakers.\n\n## Simultaneous investigations by the Justice Department\n\nThe Justice Department is also conducting an investigation into the January 6 attack, which is separate from the select committee's investigation. The Justice Department's investigation is focused on potential crimes committed during the attack, including assault, trespassing, and conspiracy.\n\n## Information received from Mark Meadows\n\nIn November 2021, the select committee received a trove of documents and communications from Mark Meadows, the former White House chief of staff. The documents included emails, text messages, and other communications that shed light on the events leading up to the January 6 attack.\n\n## Obstacles\n\nDespite the progress made in the investigation, the select committee has faced several obstacles, including:\n\n### Release of documents from the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA)\n\nIn January 2022, the select committee requested that the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) release documents related to the January 6 attack. However, the request was met with resistance from the Trump administration, which claimed that the documents were protected by executive privilege.\n\n### Republicans not testifying\n\nSeveral Republican lawmakers have refused to testify before the select committee, citing concerns about the committee's jurisdiction and the potential for partisan politics to influence the investigation.\n\n### Secret Service, DHS and Pentagon text messages deleted\n\nIn July 2022, it was revealed that the Secret Service, Department of Homeland Security, and Pentagon had deleted text messages related to the January 6 attack. The deletions raised concerns about the potential destruction of evidence and the select committee's ability to conduct a thorough investigation.\n\n### Trump funding legal defense of Republican witnesses\n\nIn August 2022, it was reported that former President Trump was funding the legal defense of several Republican witnesses who had been subpoenaed by the select committee. The move raised concerns about the potential for witness intimidation and the influence of partisan politics on the investigation.\n\n### Republican National Committee (RNC) claiming committee is illegitimate\n\nIn August 2022, the Republican National Committee (RNC) issued a statement claiming that the select committee was illegitimate and that its investigation was a \"witch hunt.\" The statement raised concerns about the potential for partisan politics to influence the investigation and the RNC's commitment to transparency and accountability.\n\n# Public findings\n\nThe select committee has released several public findings, including:\n\n## 2021 public hearings\n\nIn July 2021, the select committee held its first public hearing, which featured testimony from several law enforcement officers who responded to the January 6 attack. The hearing provided a detailed account of the events leading up to and during the attack, including the use of force by rioters and the response of law enforcement.\n\n## 2022 public hearings\n\nIn June 2022, the select committee held a series of public hearings, which featured testimony from several witnesses, including former Trump administration officials and Republican lawmakers. The hearings provided a detailed account of the events leading up to the January 6 attack, including the role of former President Trump and his allies in promoting false claims about the 2020 presidential election.\n\n## Criminal referrals\n\nIn October 2022, the select committee issued a criminal referral to the Justice Department, recommending that former President Trump be charged with crimes related to the January 6 attack. The referral marked a significant development in the investigation and raised concerns about the potential for partisan politics to influence the Justice Department's decision-making.\n\n### Impact on other investigations\n\nThe select committee's investigation has also had an impact on other investigations, including the Justice Department's investigation into the January 6 attack. The Justice Department has used evidence gathered by the select committee to inform its own investigation and has issued subpoenas to several individuals who have testified before the select committee.\n\n## Witness testimony transcripts\n\nIn November 2022, the select committee released transcripts of witness testimony, including testimony from several former Trump administration officials and Republican lawmakers. The transcripts provided a detailed account of the events leading up to and during the January 6 attack, including the role of former President Trump and his allies in promoting false claims about the 2020 presidential election.\n\n# Final report\n\nIn December 2022, the select committee released its final report, which provided a comprehensive account of the January 6 attack and the events leading up to it. The report included recommendations for preventing similar events in the future and marked a significant development in the investigation.\n\n## Before publication\n\nBefore the final report was published, the select committee voted to release the report to the public, with several Republicans voting against the measure. The vote marked a significant development in the investigation and raised concerns about the potential for partisan politics to influence the report's findings.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe final report provided a comprehensive account of the January 6 attack and the events leading up to it, including the role of former President Trump and his allies in promoting false claims about the 2020 presidential election. The report also included recommendations for preventing similar events in the future, including reforms to the Electoral Count Act and the establishment of a national commission to investigate the attack.\n\n## Full report\n\nThe full report was released to the public in December 2022 and provided a detailed account of the January 6 attack and the events leading up to it.

Saint-Georges was a prominent figure in Parisian musical society and was known for his exceptional talent as a violinist and composer. He was also a member of the aristocracy and held the title of Chevalier, which was a prestigious honor bestowed upon him by King Louis XV.\n\nEarly Life\n-----------\n\nJoseph Bologne was born on December 25, 1748, in Guadeloupe, a French colony in the West Indies. His mother, Anne Nanon, was a slave from Africa, while his father, Georges de Bologne Saint-Georges, was a wealthy plantation owner. Joseph's early life was marked by privilege, and he was educated in the arts and literature from a young age. In 1753, his family moved to France, where Joseph continued his education and began to study music.\n\nMusical Life and Career\n----------------------\n\nSaint-Georges began his musical training in Paris, where he studied violin with the renowned composer and violinist, Jean-Marie Leclair. He quickly became a skilled violinist and began to perform in public concerts, where he was praised for his exceptional talent. In 1769, Saint-Georges was appointed as the conductor of the Concert des Amateurs, a prominent concert series in Paris. He held this position until 1775 and was responsible for premiering many of his own compositions.\n\nOperas\n-------\n\nSaint-Georges composed several operas during his career, including \"Ernestine,\" \"La Partie de Chasse,\" and \"L'Amant Anonyme.\" His operas were known for their beautiful melodies and intricate harmonies, and were praised by critics and audiences alike. \"Ernestine\" was particularly successful and was performed at the Théâtre de la Comédie-Italienne in Paris.\n\nSocial Life in Paris\n--------------------\n\nSaint-Georges was a prominent figure in Parisian society and was known for his charm and wit. He was a member of several aristocratic clubs and was friends with many prominent figures, including the Duc d'Orléans and the Comte de Mercy-Argenteau. Saint-Georges was also a member of the Masonic lodge, Les Neuf Soeurs, which was a prominent organization in Paris.\n\nSt. Georges assaulted\n-------------------\n\nIn 1765, Saint-Georges was assaulted by a group of men who were angry about his relationship with a woman named Madame de Montesson. Saint-Georges was beaten and left for dead, but he survived the attack and continued to perform and compose music.\n\nTwo Trips to London\n-------------------\n\nSaint-Georges made two trips to London during his career, where he performed as a violinist and composer. His first trip was in 1787, where he performed at the Royal Opera House and was praised for his talent. His second trip was in 1790, where he performed at the Haymarket Theatre and was again praised for his music.\n\nSecond trip\n------------\n\nDuring his second trip to London, Saint-Georges met with the composer and violinist, Haydn, who was also visiting the city. The two musicians performed together and Saint-Georges was impressed by Haydn's talent.\n\nLille\n------\n\nIn 1791, Saint-Georges moved to Lille, where he became the music director of the city's opera house. He held this position until 1794 and was responsible for premiering many of his own compositions.\n\nMilitary Career\n----------------\n\nIn 1792, Saint-Georges joined the French army and became a lieutenant in the Légion St-Georges, a unit that was made up of black soldiers. He served in the army for several years and was promoted to the rank of brigadier general.\n\nPossible Saint-Domingue visit\n-----------------------------\n\nThere is some evidence to suggest that Saint-Georges may have visited Saint-Domingue (now Haiti) during the late 1790s. However, this has not been confirmed and more research is needed to determine the accuracy of this claim.\n\nDeath\n------\n\nSaint-Georges died on June 10, 1799, in Paris. He was 50 years old and had been in poor health for several years before his death.\n\nHome\n-----\n\nSaint-Georges' home in Paris was a prominent center for musical and cultural activity.
