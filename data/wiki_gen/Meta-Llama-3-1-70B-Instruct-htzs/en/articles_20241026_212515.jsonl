He has been a member of the Shiv Sena party since its inception and has held various positions in the party and the state government. Shinde's rise to prominence was marked by his role in the 2022 Maharashtra political crisis, which led to his appointment as the Chief Minister of the state.\n\n**Early life**\n\nEknath Shinde was born on February 9, 1964, in the town of Dare in the Palghar district of Maharashtra. His family was of modest means, and his father was a farmer. Shinde completed his primary education in his hometown and later moved to Thane for higher education. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from the Yashwantrao Chavan Open University.\n\n**Early political career**\n\nShinde's entry into politics was inspired by the ideology of the Shiv Sena party, which was founded by Balasaheb Thackeray. He was drawn to the party's nationalist and pro-Marathi agenda and soon became an active member of the party's local unit in Thane.\n\n### Entry into politics\n\nShinde's first foray into politics was in the 1990s, when he contested and won the local municipal council elections in Thane. He later became a member of the Thane Municipal Corporation and served as its leader of the house. Shinde's performance in the corporation earned him recognition within the party, and he was soon appointed as the district chief of the Shiv Sena in Thane.\n\n### Maharashtra Legislative Assembly & ministries\n\nIn 2004, Shinde contested the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly elections from the Kopri-Pachpakhadi constituency in Thane and won with a significant margin. He was re-elected to the assembly in 2009 and 2014 and became a key member of the Shiv Sena's legislative party.\n\nShinde has held various ministerial positions in the Maharashtra state government, including Minister of Public Works, Minister of Transport, and Minister of Urban Development. As a minister, he was known for his pragmatic approach and ability to work with other parties to achieve common goals.\n\n**Role in 2022 Maharashtra political crisis**\n\nIn June 2022, Shinde was at the center of a major political crisis in Maharashtra. The crisis began when Shinde, who was then the leader of the Shiv Sena legislative party, rebelled against the party's leadership and formed a faction with a group of dissident MLAs. The faction, which came to be known as the Shiv Sena (Shinde Group), demanded greater autonomy and a more prominent role in the party.\n\nThe crisis deepened when Shinde and his faction joined forces with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and formed a new government in the state. Shinde was sworn in as the Chief Minister of Maharashtra, marking a significant shift in the state's politics.\n\n**Chief Minister**\n\nAs the Chief Minister of Maharashtra, Shinde has focused on implementing his party's agenda and addressing the state's development needs. He has announced several initiatives aimed at promoting economic growth, improving infrastructure, and enhancing the quality of life for citizens.\n\n### Electoral performance\n\nShinde has contested several elections throughout his career, including local municipal council elections, state legislative assembly elections, and parliamentary elections. His electoral performance has been impressive, with a winning streak in the Kopri-Pachpakhadi constituency in Thane.\n\n**Leader of Shiv Sena**\n\nShinde's rebellion against the Shiv Sena leadership in 2022 led to a dispute over the party's leadership. The Shiv Sena (Shinde Group) claims to be the authentic representative of the party, while the Uddhav Thackeray-led faction disputes this claim.\n\n### Shiv Sena leadership dispute\n\nThe dispute over the Shiv Sena leadership has been marked by a series of court battles and public spats between the two factions. The dispute is yet to be resolved, with both factions claiming to be the legitimate representative of the party.\n\n### Political legitimacy\n\nShinde's appointment as the Chief Minister of Maharashtra has been controversial, with some questioning the legitimacy of his government. Critics argue that Shinde's rebellion against the Shiv Sena leadership was undemocratic and that his government is not representative of the people's will.\n\n**Personal life**\n\nShinde is married to Lata Shinde, and the couple has two sons and a daughter. He is known for his down-to-earth personality and is widely respected for his humility and simplicity.\n\n**Popular culture**\n\nShinde's rise to prominence has been the subject of much media attention and public interest. He has been featured in several news programs and has been the subject of numerous articles and opinion pieces.\n\n**References**\n\n**External links**", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Eknath_Shinde\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n#Early political career\n##Entry into politics\n###Maharashtra Legislative Assembly & ministries\n##Role in 2022 Maharashtra political crisis\n#Chief Minister\n##Electoral performance\n#Leader of Shiv Sena\n##Shiv Sena leadership dispute\n##Political legitimacy\n#Personal life\n#Popular culture\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

These storms can bring catastrophic damage and loss of life to affected areas. The year 2022 saw a significant number of tropical cyclones form around the world, with various regions experiencing their own unique set of storms. This article provides an overview of the global atmospheric and hydrological conditions that led to the formation of these storms, as well as a summary of the tropical cyclones that occurred in each region.\n\n# Global Atmospheric and Hydrological Conditions\n\nThe global atmospheric and hydrological conditions in 2022 were influenced by several climate patterns, including the El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). These patterns can impact the formation and trajectory of tropical cyclones.\n\nThe ENSO cycle was in a neutral phase during the early part of 2022, but shifted to a La Ni√±a event in the latter half of the year. This transition led to increased rainfall in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, which in turn contributed to the formation of tropical cyclones.\n\nThe PDO was in a positive phase, which typically leads to increased hurricane activity in the Pacific. The IOD was in a negative phase, which tends to enhance the formation of tropical cyclones in the Indian Ocean.\n\n# Summary\n\n## North Atlantic Ocean\n\nThe 2022 Atlantic hurricane season was slightly above average, with 14 named storms, 8 hurricanes, and 2 major hurricanes. The season began on June 5 with the formation of Tropical Storm Alex, and ended on November 30 with the dissipation of Tropical Storm Nicole.\n\n## Eastern & Central Pacific Ocean\n\nThe 2022 Eastern Pacific hurricane season was near-average, with 19 named storms, 10 hurricanes, and 4 major hurricanes. The season began on May 28 with the formation of Tropical Storm Agatha, and ended on November 30 with the dissipation of Tropical Storm Kenneth.\n\n## Western Pacific Ocean\n\nThe 2022 Pacific typhoon season was above-average, with 25 named storms, 13 typhoons, and 5 super typhoons. The season began on January 1 with the formation of Tropical Storm Pabuk, and ended on December 31 with the dissipation of Tropical Storm Pakhar.\n\n## North Indian Ocean\n\nThe 2022 North Indian Ocean cyclone season was below-average, with 4 named storms, 2 cyclones, and 1 severe cyclone. The season began on March 5 with the formation of Cyclonic Storm Asani, and ended on December 5 with the dissipation of Cyclonic Storm Sitrang.\n\n## South-West Indian Ocean\n\n### January - June\n\nThe 2022 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season was above-average, with 6 named storms, 3 tropical cyclones, and 2 intense tropical cyclones. The season began on January 19 with the formation of Tropical Storm Ana, and ended on June 30 with the dissipation of Tropical Cyclone Freddy.\n\n### July - December\n\nThe second half of the season saw an increase in activity, with 7 named storms, 4 tropical cyclones, and 2 intense tropical cyclones. The season ended on December 31 with the dissipation of Tropical Cyclone Darian.\n\n## Australian Region\n\n### January - June\n\nThe 2022 Australian region cyclone season was above-average, with 5 named storms, 3 tropical cyclones, and 1 severe tropical cyclone.

Released on July 7, 2023, the album marks the third re-recorded album by Swift, following Fearless (Taylor's Version) and Red (Taylor's Version). The re-recording of Speak Now comes as a result of Swift's highly publicized dispute with her former record label, Big Machine Records, over ownership of her master recordings.\n\n**Background**\n\nIn June 2019, it was announced that Scooter Braun's company, Ithaca Holdings, had acquired Big Machine Records, Swift's former record label, for $300 million. The deal included ownership of Swift's master recordings from her 2006 debut album to 2017's reputation. Swift publicly expressed her disapproval of the deal, stating that she had not been given the opportunity to purchase her master recordings herself and that Braun's ownership was a \"worst-case scenario\" for her. In August 2020, Swift announced that she would be re-recording her old albums in an effort to regain control over her music and master recordings.\n\n**Music and Lyrics**\n\n## Composition\n\nSpeak Now (Taylor's Version) features re-recorded versions of the original album's 14 tracks, as well as six additional tracks \"From the Vault\". The re-recorded tracks feature updated production and instrumentation, while maintaining the original lyrics and melodies. Swift worked with producers Jack Antonoff and Aaron Dessner, who also produced tracks on her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, to create a new sound that blends her country roots with pop and rock influences.\n\n## \"From the Vault\" tracks\n\nThe six \"From the Vault\" tracks are songs that Swift wrote and recorded during the original Speak Now sessions, but were ultimately not included on the final album. These tracks offer a glimpse into Swift's songwriting process and provide additional insight into the themes and emotions that she explored on the original album. The \"From the Vault\" tracks are notable for their raw, introspective quality, and demonstrate Swift's ability to craft compelling stories and characters in her songwriting.\n\n**Release**\n\nSpeak Now (Taylor's Version) was released on July 7, 2023, through Republic Records. The album was available on various formats, including CD, vinyl, and digital streaming platforms. Swift announced the album's release through social media, sharing a series of cryptic messages and visuals that hinted at the album's themes and sound.\n\n**Critical Reception**\n\nSpeak Now (Taylor's Version) received widespread critical acclaim upon its release. Reviewers praised Swift's re-recorded vocals and the updated production, which brought new life to the original songs. The \"From the Vault\" tracks were also widely praised, with many critics noting that they were among the strongest tracks on the album. The album holds a Metacritic score of 88 out of 100, based on 22 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\n\n**Commercial Performance**\n\nSpeak Now (Taylor's Version) debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart, with over 300,000 copies sold in its first week. The album also reached number one on the UK Albums Chart and the Australian Albums Chart, among others. The album's success marked Swift's 10th number-one album in the US, and further solidified her position as one of the most successful artists of the 21st century.\n\n**Recognition**\n\nSpeak Now (Taylor's Version) has been recognized as one of the best albums of 2023 by various publications, including Rolling Stone, Billboard, and NME. The album's success has also been notable for its impact on the music industry, as it has helped to raise awareness about artists' rights and the importance of owning one's master recordings.\n\n**Track Listing**\n\n1. \"Mine\"\n2. \"Sparks Fly\"\n3. \"Back to December\"\n4. \"Speak Now\"\n5. \"Dear John\"\n6. \"Mean\"\n7. \"The Story of Us\"\n8. \"Never Grow Up\"\n9. \"Enchanted\"\n10. \"Better Man\"\n11. \"Innocent\"\n12. \"Haunted\"\n13. \"Last Kiss\"\n14. \"Long Live\"\n15. \"Ours\"\n16. \"Superstar\"\n17. \"If This Was a Movie\"\n18. \"Superman\"\n19. \"You Belong With Me\" (Taylor's Version) (From the Vault)\n20. \"The Very First Night\" (From the Vault)\n\n**Personnel**\n\n* Taylor Swift ‚Äì vocals, songwriting\n* Jack Antonoff ‚Äì production, guitar, keyboards\n* Aaron Dessner ‚Äì production, guitar, keyboards\n* Paul Mirkovich ‚Äì guitar\n* Amos Heller ‚Äì bass\n* Matt Billingslea ‚Äì drums\n* Grant Mickelson ‚Äì guitar\n* Paul Sidoti ‚Äì guitar\n\n**Charts**\n\n* US Billboard 200: number one\n* UK Albums Chart: number one\n* Australian Albums Chart: number one\n* Canadian Albums Chart: number one\n\n**Certifications**\n\n* RIAA: Gold\n* BPI: Silver\n* ARIA: Gold\n\n**Release History**\n\n* July 7, 2023 ‚Äì CD, vinyl, digital streaming platforms\n\n**Notes**\n\n* Speak Now (Taylor's Version) is the third re-recorded album by Taylor Swift, following Fearless (Taylor's Version) and Red (Taylor's Version).\n* The album features re-recorded versions of the original album's 14 tracks, as well as six additional tracks \"From the Vault\".\n* The album was produced by Jack Antonoff and Aaron Dessner, who also produced tracks on Swift's 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore.\n\n**References**\n\n* Sources:\n\t+ Rolling Stone\n\t+ Billboard\n\t+ NME\n\t+ The New York Times\n\t+ Variety\n\n**External Links**\n\n* Taylor Swift's official website\n* Speak Now (Taylor's Version) on Spotify\n* Speak Now (Taylor's Version) on Apple Music", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Speak_Now_(Taylor's_Version)\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Music and lyrics\n##Composition\n##\"From the Vault\" tracks\n#Release\n#Critical reception\n#Commercial performance\n#Recognition\n#Track listing\n#Personnel\n#Charts\n#Certifications\n#Release history\n#Notes\n#References\n##Sources\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The event was the 43rd edition of the World Women's Curling Championship, and it featured 13 teams from around the world competing for the championship title.\n\n# Qualification\n\nThe qualification process for the 2022 World Women's Curling Championship was based on the results of the 2021 World Women's Curling Championship and the 2021 European Curling Championships. The top seven teams from the 2021 World Women's Curling Championship earned direct qualification, while the top two teams from the 2021 European Curling Championships also qualified. Additionally, the top team from the 2021 Americas Challenge earned a spot in the championship.\n\n## Russian participation\n\nOn February 28, 2022, the World Curling Federation announced that the Russian Curling Federation would not be allowed to participate in the 2022 World Women's Curling Championship due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This decision was made in accordance with the International Olympic Committee's recommendation to suspend Russian and Belarusian athletes from competing in international events.\n\n## COVID-19 issues\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the 2022 World Women's Curling Championship. Several teams faced challenges related to the pandemic, including travel restrictions and positive cases among team members.\n\n### Scotland\n\nThe Scottish team, skipped by Eve Muirhead, was forced to withdraw from the championship due to a positive COVID-19 case among their team members. Scotland was replaced by the Norwegian team, which was the highest-ranked team not already qualified.\n\n### Japan\n\nThe Japanese team, skipped by Satsuki Fujisawa, was also affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The team's alternate, Yumi Suzuki, tested positive for COVID-19 and was unable to compete in the championship.

The top-ranked team was Canada, followed by Sweden and Switzerland.\n\n# Rule changes\n\nThe World Curling Federation introduced several rule changes for the 2022 World Women's Curling Championship. One significant change was the introduction of a \"power play\" in the fifth end of each game. The power play allowed the team that was trailing at the time to place the stone in a more favorable position.\n\n# Round-robin standings\n\nThe round-robin standings were determined by the team's win-loss record. The top four teams in the standings advanced to the playoffs.\n\n| Team | Wins | Losses |\n| Canada | 10 | 2 |\n| Sweden | 9 | 3 |\n| Switzerland | 8 | 4 |\n| South Korea | 8 | 4 |\n| United States | 7 | 5 |\n| Japan | 6 | 6 |\n| Norway | 6 | 6 |\n| China | 5 | 7 |\n| Germany | 5 | 7 |\n| Italy | 4 | 8 |\n| Turkey | 3 | 9 |\n| Denmark | 2 | 10 |\n\n# Round-robin results\n\n## Draw 1\n\n* Canada 7, Germany 4\n* Sweden 8, Italy 3\n* Switzerland 7, Turkey 4\n* South Korea 9, Denmark 2\n\n## Draw 2\n\n* United States 8, China 5\n* Japan 7, Norway 6\n* Canada 8, Italy 4\n* Sweden 7, Turkey 3\n\n## Draw 3\n\n* Switzerland 8, Denmark 2\n* South Korea 7, Germany 4\n* United States 7, Norway 5\n* Japan 6, China 5\n\n## Draw 4\n\n* Canada 8, Turkey 3\n* Sweden 7, Germany 4\n* Switzerland 7, Italy 5\n* South Korea 9, Norway 4\n\n## Draw 5\n\n* United States 8, Denmark 2\n* Japan 7, Germany 5\n* China 6, Turkey 5\n* Canada 8, Norway 4\n\n## Draw 6\n\n* Sweden 7, South Korea 6\n* Switzerland 8, China 4\n* Italy 7, Denmark 5\n* United States 8, Turkey 3\n\n## Draw 7\n\n* Canada 8, Japan 4\n* Norway 7, Germany 6\n* South Korea 9, Italy 4\n* Sweden 7, China 5\n\n## Draw 8\n\n* Switzerland 8, United States 7\n* Turkey 7, Denmark 5\n* Japan 6, South Korea 5\n* Canada 8, China 4\n\n## Draw 9\n\n* Sweden 7, Norway 5\n* Germany 8, Italy 7\n* United States 8, South Korea 7\n* Switzerland 7, Japan 6\n\n## Draw 10\n\n* Canada 8, Denmark 3\n* China 6, Italy 5\n* Norway 7, Turkey 6\n* Sweden 7, Japan 5\n\n## Draw 11\n\n* South Korea 9, Switzerland 5\n* United States 8, Germany 7\n* Canada 8, China 4\n* Italy 7, Turkey 6\n\n## Draw 12\n\n* Japan 7, Denmark 5\n* Norway 8, South Korea 7\n* Sweden 7, United States 6\n* Switzerland 8, Germany 7\n\n## Draw 13\n\n* Canada 8, South Korea 7\n* China 6, Norway 5\n* Italy 7, Japan 6\n* Turkey 7, Germany 6\n\n## Draw 14\n\n* Sweden 7, Switzerland 6\n* United States 8, Italy 7\n* Denmark 7, Turkey 6\n* Japan 6, China 5\n\n## Draw 15\n\n* Canada 8, United States 7\n* South Korea 9, Turkey 4\n* Norway 8, Denmark 5\n* Sweden 7, Germany 6\n\n## Draw 16\n\n* Switzerland 8, Italy 7\n* China 6, Denmark 5\n* Japan 7, Turkey 6\n* Canada 8, Sweden 7\n\n## Draw 17\n\n* United States 8, Norway 7\n* South Korea 9, China 5\n* Germany 8, Japan 7\n* Italy 7, Switzerland 6\n\n## Draw 18\n\n* Canada 8, Switzerland 7\n* Sweden 7, Denmark 5\n* Turkey 7, Italy 6\n* South Korea 9, Japan 4\n\n## Draw 19\n\n* United States 8, China 7\n* Norway 8, Germany 7\n* Canada 8, Italy 4\n* Sweden 7, Turkey 5\n\n## Draw 20\n\n* Switzerland 8, Norway 7\n* South Korea 9, United States 8\n* Japan 7, Sweden 6\n* Denmark 7, Germany 6\n\n# Playoffs\n\n## Qualification games\n\n* South Korea 8, United States 6\n* Switzerland 7, Japan 6\n\n## Semifinals\n\n* Canada 9, South Korea 6\n* Sweden 8, Switzerland 6\n\n## Bronze-medal game\n\n* Switzerland 8, South Korea 6\n\n## Final\n\n* Canada 8, Sweden 6\n\n# Statistics\n\n## Top 5 player percentages\n\n| Player | Percentage |\n| Alina P√§tz (Switzerland) | 85.4% |\n| Kerri Einarson (Canada) | 84.6% |\n| Anna Hasselborg (Sweden) | 83.9% |\n| Satsuki Fujisawa (Japan) | 83.6% |\n| Kim Eun-jung (South Korea) | 83.4% |\n\n## Perfect games\n\n* Alina P√§tz (Switzerland) - Draw 10\n* Anna Hasselborg (Sweden) - Draw 14\n\n# Final standings\n\n| Team | Final standing |\n| Canada | 1st |\n| Sweden | 2nd |\n| Switzerland | 3rd |\n| South Korea | 4th |\n| United States | 5th |\n| Japan | 6th |\n| Norway | 7th |\n| China | 8th |\n| Germany | 9th |\n| Italy | 10th |\n| Turkey | 11th |\n| Denmark | 12th |\n\n# References", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_World_Women's_Curling_Championship\" following this outline:\n\n#Qualification\n##Russian participation\n##COVID-19 issues\n###Scotland\n###Japan\n#Teams\n##WCF ranking\n#Rule changes\n#Round-robin standings\n#Round-robin results\n##Draw 1\n##Draw 2\n##Draw 3\n##Draw 4\n##Draw 5\n##Draw 6\n##Draw 7\n##Draw 8\n##Draw 9\n##Draw 10\n##Draw 11\n##Draw 12\n##Draw 13\n##Draw 14\n##Draw 15\n##Draw 16\n##Draw 17\n##Draw 18\n##Draw 19\n##Draw 20\n#Playoffs\n##Qualification games\n##Semifinals\n##Bronze-medal game\n##Final\n#Statistics\n##Top 5 player percentages\n##Perfect games\n#Final standings\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The coup led to the overthrow of President Mohamed Bazoum, who had been in office since April 2021. This article provides an overview of the events leading up to the coup, the coup itself, and its aftermath.\n\n# Background\n\nNiger has a history of political instability, with multiple coups having taken place since the country gained independence from France in 1960. In 2010, a military junta overthrew President Mamadou Tandja, who had been in office since 1999. The 2010 coup led to a transition period, during which a new constitution was adopted and elections were held in 2011. However, the country continued to face challenges, including poverty, corruption, and insecurity.\n\nIn 2021, Mohamed Bazoum, a former prime minister and leader of the Nigerien Party for Democracy and Socialism (PNDS), won the presidential election. Bazoum's government faced significant challenges, including a growing Islamist insurgency and a worsening economic crisis. The government's response to these challenges was criticized by some as inadequate, leading to growing discontent among the population.\n\n# Events\n\n## 26 July\n\n### Bazoum's detention\n\nOn 26 July 2023, President Mohamed Bazoum was detained by a group of soldiers at the presidential palace in Niamey, the capital city of Niger. The soldiers, who were reportedly from the presidential guard, took control of the palace and surrounding areas. The reasons for Bazoum's detention were not immediately clear, but it was reported that the soldiers were dissatisfied with the government's handling of the country's security crisis.\n\n### Military mobilization\n\nFollowing Bazoum's detention, a military mobilization was underway in Niamey. Soldiers were deployed across the city, and key infrastructure, including the airport and major roads, were secured. The military also took control of the state television and radio stations, which were used to broadcast messages to the public.\n\n### Announcement of Bazoum's overthrow\n\nLater in the day, a group of military officers, led by General Abdourahamane Tchiani, appeared on state television to announce that Bazoum had been overthrown. The officers claimed that the coup was necessary to restore stability and security in the country, which they said had been compromised by the government's ineptitude.\n\n## 27 July\n\n### Bazoum's response\n\nOn 27 July, Bazoum released a statement condemning the coup and calling for his supporters to remain calm. He claimed that the coup was unconstitutional and that he was still the legitimate president of Niger. However, it was unclear whether Bazoum had any real authority, as the military had taken control of the country.\n\n### Military recognition of the junta\n\nThe military officers who had overthrown Bazoum established a new government, known as the National Council for the Safeguard of the Homeland (CNSP). The CNSP was recognized by the military as the new authority in Niger, and General Tchiani was appointed as its leader.\n\n## 28 July\n\nThe CNSP announced that it would establish a transition government, which would lead the country to new elections. The CNSP also promised to restore stability and security in Niger, which it said had been compromised by the previous government.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe coup had significant consequences for Niger. The country was plunged into a period of uncertainty, as the new government struggled to establish its authority. The international community condemned the coup, and many countries imposed sanctions on Niger.\n\nThe coup also had significant humanitarian consequences. Many people were displaced, and there were reports of human rights abuses by the military. The country's economy, which was already fragile, was further weakened by the coup.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## Domestic\n\nThe reaction to the coup in Niger was mixed. Some people welcomed the overthrow of Bazoum's government, which they saw as corrupt and ineffective. Others were opposed to the coup, which they saw as unconstitutional and undemocratic.\n\n## International\n\nThe international community condemned the coup, with many countries calling for the restoration of the democratically elected government. The African Union and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) both suspended Niger's membership, pending the restoration of democratic rule.\n\n# Analysis\n\nThe 2023 Nigerien coup d'√©tat was a significant event in the country's history. It highlighted the ongoing challenges facing Niger, including poverty, corruption, and insecurity. The coup also raised questions about the role of the military in politics and the need for democratic reforms.\n\nThe coup had significant consequences for Niger and the wider region. It highlighted the need for greater international cooperation to address the challenges facing West Africa, including the spread of Islamist extremism and the need for economic development.\n\n# Notes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Nigerien_coup_d'√©tat\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Events\n##26 July\n###Bazoum's detention\n###Military mobilization\n###Announcement of Bazoum's overthrow\n##27 July\n###Bazoum's response\n###Military recognition of the junta\n##28 July\n#Aftermath\n#Reactions\n##Domestic\n##International\n#Analysis\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is characterized by a strong commitment to the authority and inerrancy of the Bible, the principles of the Protestant Reformation, and a rejection of liberal theology and modernism. This movement is distinct from other forms of fundamentalism, such as dispensational fundamentalism, and is often associated with Reformed theology and Presbyterianism.\n\n# History and main leaders\n\nReformed fundamentalism has its roots in the early 20th century, when conservative Presbyterian theologians such as J. Gresham Machen and Cornelius Van Til began to challenge the growing influence of liberal theology in the Presbyterian Church in the USA. Machen, in particular, was a key figure in the development of Reformed fundamentalism, as he sought to defend the authority of Scripture and the principles of the Reformation against the encroachments of modernism.\n\nOther notable leaders of the Reformed fundamentalist movement include Charles Hodge, Benjamin Warfield, and Francis Schaeffer. These theologians and pastors played a significant role in shaping the movement's theology and practice, and their writings continue to be influential among Reformed fundamentalists today.\n\n# Theological distinctives\n\nReformed fundamentalism is characterized by several key theological distinctives, which set it apart from other forms of Christianity.\n\n## Broader conservative evangelicalism\n\nReformed fundamentalism is part of the broader conservative evangelical movement, which emerged in the mid-20th century as a response to the perceived theological liberalism of mainline Protestant denominations. Conservative evangelicals generally affirm the authority and inerrancy of Scripture, the importance of personal conversion and evangelism, and the need for a biblically-based approach to theology and practice.\n\n### Pertaining to salvation and the gospel\n\nReformed fundamentalists emphasize the importance of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ, and the necessity of a personal conversion experience. They also stress the importance of evangelism and missions, as a means of spreading the gospel to a lost world.\n\n### Other fundamental Protestant and biblical theology\n\nReformed fundamentalists also affirm the fundamental principles of Protestant theology, such as the authority of Scripture, justification by faith alone, and the priesthood of all believers. They also emphasize the importance of a biblically-based approach to theology and practice, and the need to interpret Scripture in a literal and historical manner.\n\n## The inspiration and preservation of the Scriptures\n\nReformed fundamentalists have a high view of Scripture, affirming its inspiration and preservation as the very words of God.\n\n### Verbal plenary inspiration\n\nReformed fundamentalists affirm the doctrine of verbal plenary inspiration, which holds that the very words of Scripture were inspired by God, and are therefore authoritative and inerrant.\n\n### Preservation of the texts of scripture\n\nReformed fundamentalists also affirm the preservation of the texts of Scripture, believing that God has providentially preserved the text of Scripture through the centuries, despite the presence of textual variants and errors.\n\n## Common principles of Reformation evangelical interpretation and private reading\n\nReformed fundamentalists emphasize the importance of a biblically-based approach to interpretation and private reading of Scripture. They affirm the principles of the Reformation, such as the importance of Scripture alone (sola scriptura) and faith alone (sola fide), and emphasize the need to interpret Scripture in a literal and historical manner.\n\n## The classical creeds and reformational confessions\n\nReformed fundamentalists also affirm the classical creeds and reformational confessions, such as the Westminster Confession of Faith and the Belgic Confession, as a means of summarizing the key principles of Christian theology and practice.\n\n# Congregational practices\n\nReformed fundamentalist congregations are characterized by a strong emphasis on biblical preaching and teaching, as well as a commitment to the ordinances of baptism and the Lord's Supper.\n\n# Bible translation and usage\n\nReformed fundamentalists have a high view of Scripture, and therefore place a strong emphasis on the importance of accurate Bible translation and usage.\n\n## The Authorised Version Tradition, the Byzantine Received Text, and Eastern (Greek) and Western (Greco-Latin) Ecclesiastical Translation Traditions\n\nReformed fundamentalists often affirm the Authorised Version Tradition, which holds that the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible is the most accurate and reliable translation of Scripture. They also affirm the Byzantine Received Text, which is the underlying text of the KJV, and emphasize the importance of the Eastern (Greek) and Western (Greco-Latin) Ecclesiastical Translation Traditions in the preservation of Scripture.\n\n## Modern versions, denominational preferences and translation controversies\n\nReformed fundamentalists are often critical of modern Bible versions, such as the New International Version (NIV) and the New American Standard Bible (NASB), which they see as lacking the accuracy and reliability of the KJV. They also emphasize the importance of denominational preferences and translation controversies in the preservation of Scripture.\n\n# Evangelical and missional apologetics\n\nReformed fundamentalists emphasize the importance of apologetics, or the defense of the Christian faith, in evangelism and missions.\n\n## Bible apologetics\n\nReformed fundamentalists often engage in Bible apologetics, which involves defending the authority and inerrancy of Scripture against criticisms and challenges.\n\n# Liberal-modernist challenge to verbal inspiration and truthfulness of scripture\n\nReformed fundamentalists have historically challenged the liberal-modernist critique of verbal inspiration and the truthfulness of Scripture, which they see as undermining the authority and reliability of the Bible.\n\n# Modern biblical criticism\n\nReformed fundamentalists are also critical of modern biblical criticism, which they see as undermining the authority and reliability of Scripture through its emphasis on source criticism, form criticism, and redaction criticism.\n\n# Modern Western society and intellectual unbelief\n\nReformed fundamentalists often critique modern Western society and intellectual unbelief, which they see as rejecting the authority and truthfulness of Scripture in favor of secularism and humanism.\n\n## Criticism of New-Neo Evangelicalism and the 'Present Downgrade'\n\nReformed fundamentalists often criticize New-Neo Evangelicalism, which they see as compromising the authority and truthfulness of Scripture in favor of a more liberal and ecumenical approach to theology and practice.\n\n## Materialist and naturalist unbelief, and historic Adamism and creationism\n\nReformed fundamentalists also critique materialist and naturalist unbelief, which they see as rejecting the authority and truthfulness of Scripture in favor of a purely scientific and naturalistic worldview. They also emphasize the importance of historic Adamism and creationism, which they see as essential to a biblically-based approach to theology and practice.\n\n# See also\n\n* Reformed theology\n* Presbyterianism\n* Fundamentalism\n* Evangelicalism\n* Apologetics\n* Biblical criticism\n\n# Resources\n\n* J.

Her case drew widespread media attention and raised concerns about the safety and quality of care in the National Health Service (NHS).\n\n#Early life and education\n\nLucy Letby was born in 1990 in Hereford, England. She grew up in a family of medical professionals and developed an interest in nursing from an early age. Letby pursued her passion for nursing at the University of Chester, where she earned a degree in nursing in 2011. After completing her degree, she began working as a neonatal nurse at the Countess of Chester Hospital in 2011.\n\n#Career\n\nLetby worked as a neonatal nurse at the Countess of Chester Hospital for over five years, gaining experience and developing her skills in caring for premature and critically ill babies. During her time at the hospital, she was known to be a dedicated and hardworking nurse, with many colleagues and patients' families praising her professionalism and kindness.\n\n#Initial investigations\n\nIn 2015, concerns were raised about a higher-than-expected number of baby deaths at the Countess of Chester Hospital's neonatal unit. An initial investigation by the hospital's management and local health authorities found no evidence of wrongdoing or negligence. However, further investigations were launched in 2016 after a whistleblower reported concerns about Letby's behavior and the care provided to babies on the unit.\n\n#2023 trial\n\nLetby's trial began in 2023, with the prosecution alleging that she had deliberately harmed and killed several babies in her care. The trial lasted for several months and heard evidence from numerous witnesses, including medical experts, hospital staff, and parents of the affected babies.\n\n##Evidence\n\nThe prosecution presented a range of evidence against Letby, including handwritten notes, medical records, and testimony from colleagues and experts.\n\n###Handwritten notes\n\nProsecutors presented handwritten notes made by Letby during her shifts, which appeared to show a pattern of unusual and unexplained events, including sudden changes in babies' conditions and unexpected deaths. The prosecution argued that these notes demonstrated Letby's deliberate attempts to harm the babies.\n\n###Medical records\n\nMedical records of the affected babies were also presented as evidence, showing a range of unusual and unexplained medical issues, including collapses, seizures, and cardiac arrests. The prosecution argued that these records demonstrated a clear pattern of deliberate harm and neglect.\n\n##Letby's testimony\n\nLetby took the stand during the trial, denying all allegations against her. She claimed that she had always acted in the best interests of the babies in her care and had never intentionally harmed anyone. However, her testimony was challenged by the prosecution, who pointed out inconsistencies and contradictions in her story.\n\n##Defence arguments\n\nLetby's defence team argued that the prosecution's case relied heavily on circumstantial evidence and that there was no direct proof of her guilt. They also pointed out that the hospital's neonatal unit was understaffed and under-resourced, which may have contributed to the high number of baby deaths.\n\n##Verdicts and sentencing\n\nAfter several months of deliberation, the jury delivered guilty verdicts on all counts, convicting Letby of murdering seven babies and attempting to murder six others. She was sentenced to life imprisonment, with a minimum term of 30 years.\n\n#Motives\n\nThe exact motives behind Letby's actions remain unclear. However, the prosecution suggested that she may have been motivated by a desire for attention and sympathy, as well as a sense of power and control over the vulnerable babies in her care.\n\n#Post-conviction\n\nFollowing Letby's conviction, several investigations were launched into the safety and quality of care at the Countess of Chester Hospital.\n\n##Disciplinary action\n\nSeveral hospital staff members were disciplined for their role in the scandal, including the hospital's former chief executive and several senior nurses.\n\n##Appeal\n\nLetby's defence team launched an appeal against her conviction, arguing that the prosecution's case relied on flawed evidence and that the trial was unfair.\n\n##Retrial\n\nIn 2023, it was announced that Letby would face a retrial on all counts, following concerns about the safety of her conviction.\n\n##Further investigations\n\nSeveral further investigations were launched into the safety and quality of care at the Countess of Chester Hospital, including a major inquiry led by the NHS.\n\n##Thirlwall inquiry\n\nThe Thirlwall inquiry, led by a retired judge, was launched in 2023 to investigate the safety and quality of care at the Countess of Chester Hospital. The inquiry heard evidence from numerous witnesses, including hospital staff, patients' families, and medical experts.\n\n#Reactions\n\nThe Letby case sparked widespread outrage and concern about the safety and quality of care in the NHS.\n\n##Calls for regulation and reform\n\nSeveral politicians and healthcare experts called for greater regulation and reform of the NHS, including improved staffing ratios and better training for healthcare staff.\n\n#Safety of the convictions\n\nSeveral concerns were raised about the safety of Letby's convictions, including concerns about the quality of the medical evidence and the reliability of key witnesses.\n\n##Concerns about the medical evidence\n\nSeveral medical experts raised concerns about the quality of the medical evidence presented during the trial, including concerns about the use of insulin and air via na", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Lucy_Letby\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and education\n#Career\n#Initial investigations\n#2023 trial\n##Evidence\n###Handwritten notes\n###Medical records\n##Letby's testimony\n##Defence arguments\n##Verdicts and sentencing\n#Motives\n#Post-conviction\n##Disciplinary action\n##Appeal\n##Retrial\n##Further investigations\n##Thirlwall inquiry\n#Reactions\n##Calls for regulation and reform\n#Safety of the convictions\n##Concerns about the medical evidence\n###Insulin\n###Air via nasogastric tube\n###Air embolism\n##Quality of the statistical evidence\n##Staff and infrastructure issues\n##Timeline\n###X-ray timing\n###Mislabelled door swipe data\n##Interpretation of handwritten notes\n##Criticism of witnesses\n##Reaction to doubt\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

They were instrumental in the creation of the Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation, and the United States Constitution. These documents have had a lasting impact on the country's history and development, and the principles they enshrined continue to influence American politics, law, and society to this day.\n\n# Historical founders\n\nThe term \"Founding Fathers\" is a bit misleading, as it implies that only men were involved in the creation of the United States. However, women also played important roles in the Revolution and the early years of the country. In addition, not all of the Founding Fathers were born in the United States; some were born in England, Scotland, and other parts of Europe.\n\n# Origin of phrase\n\nThe phrase \"Founding Fathers\" was first used in 1916 by Warren G. Harding, who later became the 29th President of the United States. Harding used the term in a speech he gave to the Republican National Convention, and it quickly gained popularity as a way to refer to the men who had played key roles in the creation of the United States.\n\n# List of Founding Fathers\n\n## Framers and signers\n\nThe following individuals were signers of the Declaration of Independence and/or the United States Constitution:\n\n* John Adams\n* Samuel Adams\n* Josiah Bartlett\n* Carter Braxton\n* Charles Carroll\n* Samuel Chase\n* Abraham Clark\n* George Clymer\n* William Ellery\n* William Floyd\n* Benjamin Franklin\n* Elbridge Gerry\n* Button Gwinnett\n* Lyman Hall\n* John Hancock\n* Benjamin Harrison\n* John Hart\n* Joseph Hewes\n* Thomas Heyward Jr.\n* William Hooper\n* Stephen Hopkins\n* Francis Hopkinson\n* Samual Huntington\n* Thomas Jefferson\n* Richard Henry Lee\n* John Morton\n* Thomas Nelson Jr.\n* William Paca\n* Robert Treat Paine\n* John Penn\n* George Read\n* Caesar Rodney\n* George Ross\n* Edward Rutledge\n* Roger Sherman\n* James Smith\n* Richard Stockton\n* Thomas Stone\n* George Taylor\n* Matthew Thornton\n* George Walton\n* William Whipple\n* John Witherspoon\n* Oliver Wolcott\n* George Wythe\n\n### Other delegates\n\nThe following individuals were delegates to the Continental Congress, but did not sign the Declaration of Independence:\n\n* George Mason\n* James Madison\n* George Washington\n\n## Additional Founding Fathers\n\nThe following individuals are also considered to be Founding Fathers, although they did not sign the Declaration of Independence or the United States Constitution:\n\n* Alexander Hamilton\n* John Jay\n* Patrick Henry\n* Thomas Paine\n* Paul Revere\n* John Paul Jones\n\n## Women founders\n\nThe following women played important roles in the Revolution and the early years of the United States:\n\n* Abigail Adams\n* Deborah Read Franklin\n* Esther Reed\n* Sarah Franklin Bache\n* Mercy Otis Warren\n\n## Other patriots\n\nThe following individuals were patriots who fought for American independence:\n\n* Crispus Attucks\n* John Andr√©\n* Nathan Hale\n* William Prescott\n* Deborah Sampson\n\n# The colonies unite (1765‚Äì1774)\n\nThe Founding Fathers were not the only individuals who played a role in the creation of the United States.

His life's work was marked by a series of contradictions and controversies, as he navigated the complex web of Romanian politics and identity.\n\n#Biography\n\n##Early life and career\n\nMi»ôu Benvenisti was born in 1902 in Bucharest, Romania, to a Jewish family. From a young age, he was drawn to socialism and activism, and he quickly became involved in the Romanian socialist movement. Benvenisti's early career was marked by his work as a journalist and writer, and he was known for his sharp critiques of Romanian politics and society.\n\n##Fighting antisemitism\n\nBenvenisti's most notable early work was his advocacy against antisemitism in Romania. He was a vocal critic of the Romanian government's treatment of Jewish citizens, and he worked tirelessly to expose the injustices and prejudices faced by the Jewish community. Benvenisti's efforts were met with resistance and hostility from many quarters, but he remained undeterred in his quest for justice.\n\n##Against Richter\n\nOne of Benvenisti's most notable campaigns was his fight against the notorious antisemite and politician, Eugen Richter. Richter was a leading figure in the Romanian fascist movement, and his rhetoric and policies were marked by virulent antisemitism. Benvenisti was a vocal critic of Richter, and he worked to expose the politician's hypocrisy and bigotry.\n\n##HeHalutz trial and marginalization\n\nIn 1936, Benvenisti was involved in the HeHalutz trial, a highly publicized case involving a group of Jewish activists who were accused of subversion and treason. The trial was widely seen as a show trial, and Benvenisti's involvement was seen as a way of silencing his vocal criticism of the Romanian government. The trial resulted in the marginalization of Benvenisti and many of his fellow activists, and it marked a turning point in his relationship with the Romanian government.\n\n##Communist turn\n\nIn the late 1930s, Benvenisti began to move towards communism, and he eventually joined the Romanian Communist Party. This move was seen as a surprise by many, given Benvenisti's earlier critiques of communism. However, Benvenisti saw the Communist Party as a way of fighting against fascism and antisemitism, and he became a vocal advocate for the Party's policies.\n\n##Zionist ban\n\nBenvenisti's turn towards communism was marked by a ban on his involvement in Zionist activities. The Communist Party saw Zionism as a form of bourgeois nationalism, and Benvenisti was forced to choose between his loyalty to the Party and his commitment to Zionism. Benvenisti chose to prioritize his loyalty to the Party, and he was subsequently banned from participating in Zionist activities.\n\n##Communist imprisonment and release\n\nIn 1948, Benvenisti was arrested and imprisoned by the Romanian Communist government. The exact reasons for his imprisonment are unclear, but it is believed that he was seen as a threat to the Party's authority. Benvenisti was released from prison in 1954, and he spent the remainder of his life in relative obscurity.\n\n#Notes\n\nMi»ôu Benvenisti's life and work are a testament to the complexities and contradictions of Romanian politics and identity. His advocacy against antisemitism and fascism was marked by a series of challenges and controversies, and his turn towards communism was seen as a surprise by many. Despite his later marginalization and imprisonment, Benvenisti remains an important figure in Romanian history, and his legacy continues to be felt today.\n\n#References", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Mi»ôu_Benvenisti\" following this outline:\n\n#Biography\n##Early life and career\n##Fighting antisemitism\n##Against Richter\n##HeHalutz trial and marginalization\n##Communist turn\n##Zionist ban\n##Communist imprisonment and release\n#Notes\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It began in July 1947, when a strange object crashed on a ranch near Roswell, New Mexico. The incident has spawned numerous conspiracy theories, books, and films, and has become a cultural phenomenon. This article will explore the events surrounding the Roswell incident, the various conspiracy theories that have emerged, and the explanations that have been proposed to explain the incident.\n\n# 1947 Military Balloon Crash\n\nOn July 2, 1947, a strange object was spotted in the skies above Roswell, New Mexico. The next day, a rancher named W.W. \"Mack\" Brazel discovered a large amount of debris scattered across his property. Brazel reported his find to the local sheriff, who in turn notified the military authorities at Roswell Army Air Field. On July 4, a team of military personnel was sent to the ranch to investigate the debris. They collected the material and brought it back to the base for further examination.\n\nOn July 8, the Roswell Army Air Field issued a press release announcing the recovery of a \"flying disc.\" However, just one day later, the military retracted their statement, saying that the object was actually a weather balloon that had been found. The incident was largely forgotten until the 1970s, when it was revived by UFO enthusiasts.\n\n# UFO Conspiracy Theories (1947‚Äì1978)\n\nIn the years following the incident, various UFO conspiracy theories emerged. Many people believed that the military had recovered an extraterrestrial spacecraft and was covering it up.\n\n## Aztec Crashed Saucer Hoax\n\nOne of the earliest and most enduring UFO conspiracy theories surrounding Roswell was the Aztec crashed saucer hoax. This theory claimed that the military had recovered a UFO in Aztec, New Mexico, and was studying it in secret. However, the theory was later debunked as a hoax.\n\n## Hangar 18\n\nAnother popular UFO conspiracy theory emerged in the 1960s, claiming that the military had stored the recovered UFO in a secret hangar at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio. This theory, known as \"Hangar 18,\" was popularized in a book of the same name.\n\n# Roswell Conspiracy Theories (1978‚Äì1994)\n\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, a new wave of UFO conspiracy theories emerged, focusing specifically on the Roswell incident.\n\n## The Roswell Incident\n\nIn 1980, a book titled \"The Roswell Incident\" was published, claiming that the military had recovered an extraterrestrial spacecraft and was covering it up. The book was a bestseller and helped to revive interest in the Roswell incident.\n\n## Majestic 12 Hoax\n\nIn 1980, a set of allegedly leaked documents known as the \"Majestic 12\" were published, claiming to reveal a secret government project to study extraterrestrial life. However, the documents were later debunked as a hoax.\n\n## Role of Glenn Dennis\n\nGlenn Dennis, a mortician from Roswell, claimed to have been involved in the recovery of alien bodies from the crash. His story was widely publicized and helped to fuel the conspiracy theories surrounding Roswell.\n\n## Competing Accounts and Schism\n\nIn the 1980s, a schism emerged among UFO enthusiasts, with some supporting the \"UFO Crash at Roswell\" theory, while others supported the \"Crash at Corona\" theory.\n\n### UFO Crash at Roswell\n\nThis theory claimed that the UFO had crashed on the Brazel ranch, and that the military had recovered alien bodies and debris.\n\n### Crash at Corona\n\nThis theory claimed that the UFO had actually crashed on the Plains of San Augustin, near Corona, New Mexico, and that the military had recovered debris and alien bodies from this site.\n\n### The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell\n\nIn 1991, a book titled \"The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell\" was published, claiming to reveal new evidence about the incident. However, the book was widely criticized for its lack of credible evidence.\n\n# Air Force Response\n\nIn response to the growing public interest in the Roswell incident, the US Air Force launched an investigation into the incident in the 1990s. The investigation concluded that the object that crashed on the Brazel ranch was likely a top-secret balloon reconnaissance project called \"Project Mogul.\"\n\n# Later Theories and Hoaxes (1994‚Äìpresent)\n\nDespite the Air Force's conclusions, many UFO conspiracy theories continue to surround the Roswell incident.\n\n## Alien Autopsy\n\nIn 1995, a film titled \"Alien Autopsy\" was released, claiming to show footage of an alien autopsy from the Roswell crash. However, the film was later revealed to be a hoax.\n\n## The Day After Roswell\n\nIn 1997, a book titled \"The Day After Roswell\" was published, claiming that the military had recovered an extraterrestrial spacecraft and was studying it in secret. However, the book was widely criticized for its lack of credible evidence.\n\n## Related Debunked or Fringe Theories\n\nOther debunked or fringe theories surrounding the Roswell incident include claims of alien bodies being stored in secret facilities, and claims of government cover-ups.\n\n# Explanations\n\nSeveral explanations have been proposed to explain the Roswell incident.\n\n## Project Mogul\n\nThe most widely accepted explanation is that the object that crashed on the Brazel ranch was a top-secret balloon reconnaissance project called \"Project Mogul.\"\n\n## Anthropomorphic Dummies\n\nSome researchers have suggested that the \"alien bodies\" recovered from the crash were actually anthropomorphic dummies used in military experiments.\n\n## Roswell as Modern Myth and Folklore\n\nThe Roswell incident has become a modern myth and folklore, with many people believing that the military recovered an extraterrestrial spacecraft and is covering it up.\n\n# Cultural Impact\n\nThe Roswell incident has had a significant cultural impact, inspiring numerous books, films, and TV shows.\n\n## Tourism and Commercialization\n\nRoswell, New Mexico, has become a tourist destination, with many businesses capitalizing on the UFO theme.\n\n## Popular Fiction\n\nThe Roswell incident has been featured in numerous works of popular fiction, including films, TV shows, and books.\n\n## Statements by US Presidents\n\nSeveral US Presidents have made statements about the Roswell incident, including Bill Clinton, who joked about the incident during a speech.\n\n# See Also\n\n* UFO\n* Extraterrestrial life\n* Conspiracy theories\n* Folklore\n* Mythology\n\n# References\n\n* Sources:\n\t+ Books\n\t+ Articles\n\t+ Websites\n\n# External Links\n\n* Roswell UFO Museum\n* National UFO Reporting Center\n* Project Blue Book", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Roswell_incident\" following this outline:\n\n#1947 military balloon crash\n#UFO conspiracy theories (1947‚Äì1978)\n##Aztec crashed saucer hoax\n##Hangar 18\n#Roswell conspiracy theories (1978‚Äì1994)\n##The Roswell Incident\n##Majestic 12 hoax\n##Role of Glenn Dennis\n##Competing accounts and schism\n###UFO Crash at Roswell\n###Crash at Corona\n###The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell\n#Air Force response\n#Later theories and hoaxes (1994‚Äìpresent)\n##Alien Autopsy\n##The Day After Roswell\n##Related debunked or fringe theories\n#Explanations\n##Project Mogul\n##Anthropomorphic dummies\n##Roswell as modern myth and folklore\n#Cultural impact\n##Tourism and commercialization\n##Popular fiction\n##Statements by US Presidents\n#See also\n#References\n##Sources\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Anti-Zionism has taken many forms throughout history, from early Jewish and Arab opposition to Zionism to modern-day criticisms of Israeli policies. This article will explore the various manifestations of anti-Zionism from its early beginnings to the present day.\n\n# Anti-Zionism before 1948\n\n## Early Jewish anti-Zionism\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many Jews opposed Zionism for various reasons. Some saw it as a threat to their integration into European societies, while others believed that it was a form of Jewish nationalism that would lead to the displacement of Palestinians. Prominent Jewish intellectuals such as Hannah Arendt and Martin Buber spoke out against Zionism, advocating for a binational state in Palestine where Jews and Arabs could coexist.\n\n## Early Arab anti-Zionism\n\nArab opposition to Zionism emerged in the early 20th century, as Palestinian Arabs began to realize the implications of Jewish immigration to Palestine. Arab leaders such as Rashid Khalidi and Amin al-Husseini argued that Zionism was a form of colonialism that would displace Palestinians from their land. Arab anti-Zionism gained momentum in the 1920s and 1930s, as Jewish immigration to Palestine increased.\n\n## Reactions to the Balfour Declaration\n\nIn 1917, the British government issued the Balfour Declaration, which expressed support for the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. Arab leaders responded with outrage, seeing the declaration as a betrayal of Palestinian rights. Jewish leaders, on the other hand, hailed the declaration as a major victory for Zionism.\n\n## Anti-Zionism in the 1920s‚Äì1930s\n\nThe 1920s and 1930s saw a significant increase in anti-Zionist activity, particularly among Arabs. Palestinian Arabs organized protests, boycotts, and armed resistance against Jewish immigration and land purchases. Jewish anti-Zionists, on the other hand, continued to advocate for a binational state and opposed the growing militarization of the Zionist movement.\n\n## The Biltmore programme and its anti-Zionism fall-out\n\nIn 1942, the American Zionist movement adopted the Biltmore Programme, which called for the establishment of a Jewish commonwealth in Palestine. Arab leaders responded with outrage, seeing the programme as a threat to Palestinian rights. Jewish anti-Zionists also opposed the programme, arguing that it was a form of Jewish nationalism that would lead to conflict with Arabs.\n\n## Religious\n\nSome Jewish religious leaders opposed Zionism on theological grounds, arguing that the establishment of a Jewish state was a human attempt to preempt the divine redemption of the Jewish people. Similarly, some Christian leaders opposed Zionism, seeing it as a form of Jewish exclusivism that contradicted Christian teachings of universalism.\n\n# Anti-Zionism after World War II and the creation of Israel\n\n## 1947‚Äì1948\n\nIn the aftermath of World War II, the international community began to take notice of the Zionist movement and its demands for a Jewish state. The United Nations Special Committee on Palestine (UNSCOP) proposed a plan for the partition of Palestine, which was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by Arab leaders. The creation of the State of Israel in May 1948 led to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, known as the Nakba or \"catastrophe\" in Arabic.\n\n## Soviet Union\n\nThe Soviet Union initially supported the creation of Israel, seeing it as a way to undermine British colonialism in the region. However, as the Cold War intensified, the Soviet Union began to view Israel as a proxy for Western imperialism and shifted its support to Arab states.\n\n## Arab and Palestinian anti-Zionism\n\nThe creation of Israel led to a significant increase in Arab and Palestinian anti-Zionism. Arab leaders saw Israel as a threat to regional stability and a form of colonialism that had displaced Palestinians from their land. Palestinian anti-Zionism took many forms, from armed resistance to nonviolent protests.\n\n## Perception of Zionism as racism\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, some critics of Zionism began to view it as a form of racism, arguing that it was a system of oppression that privileged Jewish rights over those of Palestinians. This perception gained momentum in the 1980s and 1990s, particularly among left-wing activists and academics.\n\n### During the Cold War\n\nDuring the Cold War, anti-Zionism was often linked to anti-imperialism and anti-colonialism. Many left-wing activists and intellectuals saw Zionism as a form of Western colonialism that had displaced Palestinians from their land.\n\n### After the Cold War\n\nAfter the Cold War, anti-Zionism continued to evolve, with many critics focusing on Israeli policies in the occupied territories. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict became a major focal point for anti-Zionist activism, with many activists advocating for a boycott of Israel and an end to the occupation.\n\n## Islamic perspectives\n\nIslamic perspectives on Zionism vary widely, ranging from outright rejection to more nuanced critiques. Some Islamic leaders view Zionism as a form of Jewish exclusivism that contradicts Islamic teachings of universalism. Others see it as a form of colonialism that has displaced Palestinians from their land.\n\n## Left-wing politics\n\nLeft-wing politics have long been critical of Zionism, viewing it as a form of nationalism that privileges Jewish rights over those of Palestinians. Many left-wing activists and intellectuals have advocated for a boycott of Israel and an end to the occupation.\n\n## Christian anti-Zionism\n\nChristian anti-Zionism takes many forms, ranging from theological critiques to more practical concerns about the impact of Zionism on Palestinian Christians.\n\n### Protestants\n\nProtestant anti-Zionism has a long history, dating back to the early 20th century. Some Protestant leaders have argued that Zionism is a form of Jewish exclusivism that contradicts Christian teachings of universalism.\n\n### Catholics\n\nCatholic anti-Zionism has also been significant, particularly in the aftermath of the Holocaust. Some Catholic leaders have argued that Zionism is a form of Jewish nationalism that has led to the displacement of Palestinians from their land.\n\n## Haredi Judaism\n\nHaredi Judaism, a form of ultra-Orthodox Judaism, has long been critical of Zionism, viewing it as a form of Jewish nationalism that contradicts traditional Jewish teachings. Some Haredi leaders have argued that the establishment of the State of Israel is a form of human attempt to preempt the divine redemption of the Jewish people.\n\n# Allegations of antisemitism\n\nThe question of whether anti-Zionism is a form of antisemitism is highly contested. Some argue that anti-Zionism is a legitimate form of criticism of Israeli policies, while others see it as a form of antisemitism that seeks to delegitimize the Jewish state.\n\n## Jewish right to a state\n\nSome argue that the Jewish right to a state is a fundamental right that is recognized by international law. Others argue that this right is not absolute and must be balanced against the rights of Palestinians.\n\n## Equating and correlating anti-Zionism with antisemitism\n\nSome critics of anti-Zionism argue that it is a form of antisemitism that seeks to delegitimize the Jewish state. Others argue that this equation is not always valid and that anti-Zionism can be a legitimate form of criticism of Israeli policies.\n\n## View that the two are not interlinked\n\nSome argue that anti-Zionism and antisemitism are distinct phenomena that are not necessarily interlinked. Others argue that anti-Zionism can sometimes be a form of antisemitism that seeks to delegitimize the Jewish state.\n\n## Shifting positions on the Zionist/Anti-Zionist spectrum\n\nSome individuals and organizations have shifted their positions on the Zionist/anti-Zionist spectrum over time, reflecting changing circumstances and perspectives.\n\n## Far-right politics\n\nFar-right politics have often been linked to antisemitism, and some critics argue that anti-Zionism can be a form of antisemitism that seeks to delegitimize the Jewish state.\n\n## Conspiracy theories\n\nConspiracy theories about Zionism and the Jewish state are common, and some critics argue that these theories are a form of antisemitism that seeks to delegitimize the Jewish state.\n\n# See also\n\n* Zionism\n* Anti-Semitism\n* Arab-Israeli conflict\n* Palestinian nationalism\n* Israeli-Palestinian conflict\n* Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions\n\n# Notes\n\n# Sources\n\n# External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Anti-Zionism\" following this outline:\n\n#Anti-Zionism before 1948\n##Early Jewish anti-Zionism\n##Early Arab anti-Zionism\n##Reactions to the Balfour Declaration\n##Anti-Zionism in the 1920s‚Äì1930s\n##The Biltmore programme and its anti-Zionism fall-out\n##Religious\n#Anti-Zionism after World War II and the creation of Israel\n##1947‚Äì1948\n##Soviet Union\n##Arab and Palestinian anti-Zionism\n##Perception of Zionism as racism\n###During the Cold War\n###After the Cold War\n##Islamic perspectives\n##Left-wing politics\n##Christian anti-Zionism\n###Protestants\n###Catholics\n##Haredi Judaism\n#Allegations of antisemitism\n##Jewish right to a state\n##Equating and correlating anti-Zionism with antisemitism\n##View that the two are not interlinked\n##Shifting positions on the Zionist/Anti-Zionist spectrum\n##Far-right politics\n##Conspiracy theories\n#See also\n#Notes\n##Citations\n#Sources\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The incumbent Fidesz-KDNP coalition, led by Prime Minister Viktor Orb√°n, sought to extend its 12-year rule.\n\n# Background\n\n## Amendment of the electoral law\n\nIn 2020, the Hungarian government introduced a new electoral law, which replaced the previous mixed-member proportional representation system with a mixed electoral system. The new system combines single-member constituencies with a national list. The law also reduced the number of parliamentary seats from 199 to 199, with 106 seats allocated to single-member constituencies and 93 seats allocated to the national list. The amendment aimed to reduce the representation of smaller parties and increase the chances of the ruling coalition.\n\n## Creation of joint opposition list\n\nIn response to the amended electoral law, the opposition parties formed a joint list, known as the United for Hungary alliance. The alliance consisted of six parties, including the Democratic Coalition, Jobbik, LMP ‚Äì Hungary's Green Party, Momentum Movement, MSZP, and Dialogue ‚Äì The Greens' Party. The opposition parties aimed to present a united front against the ruling coalition.\n\n## Opposition primary\n\nIn 2021, the United for Hungary alliance held a primary election to select its candidates for the single-member constituencies. The primary was won by P√©ter M√°rki-Zay, the mayor of H√≥dmez≈ëv√°s√°rhely, who became the opposition's prime ministerial candidate.\n\n# Electoral system\n\nThe 2022 Hungarian parliamentary election used a mixed electoral system, which combined single-member constituencies with a national list. The 106 single-member constituencies were won by the candidate with the most votes. The 93 seats allocated to the national list were distributed among the parties using the d'Hondt method, with a 5% threshold.\n\n# Parties and coalitions\n\nThe following parties and coalitions participated in the 2022 Hungarian parliamentary election:\n\n* Fidesz-KDNP: The ruling coalition, led by Prime Minister Viktor Orb√°n.\n* United for Hungary: The opposition alliance, led by P√©ter M√°rki-Zay.\n* Mi Haz√°nk: A far-right party, led by L√°szl√≥ Toroczkai.\n* Our Home Movement: A far-right party, led by L√°szl√≥ B√≠r√≥.\n\n# Opinion polls\n\nOpinion polls conducted before the election showed a close contest between the Fidesz-KDNP coalition and the United for Hungary alliance. According to a poll conducted by the Sz√°zadv√©g Foundation in March 2022, the Fidesz-KDNP coalition led the United for Hungary alliance by 2%.\n\n# Results\n\nThe 2022 Hungarian parliamentary election was won by the Fidesz-KDNP coalition, which secured 135 seats in the National Assembly. The United for Hungary alliance won 56 seats, while Mi Haz√°nk and Our Home Movement won 7 and 6 seats, respectively.\n\n## Result by constituency\n\nThe Fidesz-KDNP coalition won 87 single-member constituencies, while the United for Hungary alliance won 19 constituencies. Mi Haz√°nk and Our Home Movement won 1 constituency each.\n\n## Party list results by county and in the diaspora\n\nThe Fidesz-KDNP coalition won the most seats in all counties, except for Budapest, where the United for Hungary alliance won the most seats. In the diaspora, the Fidesz-KDNP coalition won the most seats.\n\n# Aftermath\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe 2022 Hungarian parliamentary election was characterized by a low turnout, with only 67.8% of eligible voters casting their ballots. The election was also marked by allegations of electoral irregularities and anomalies.\n\n## Conduct\n\nThe election was observed by international organizations, including the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and the Council of Europe. The observers noted that the election was generally well-conducted, but raised concerns about the electoral law and the lack of transparency in the campaign finance.\n\n## Anomalies over postal ballots\n\nThere were allegations of anomalies in the counting of postal ballots, with opposition parties claiming that the ruling coalition had manipulated the process.

This concept has been explored by various composers throughout history, resulting in a diverse range of works that showcase their technical skill and creativity.\n\n# Notable Sets that Cover All 24 Keys\n\nSeveral notable composers have written sets of 24 pieces that cover all major and minor keys. These sets often demonstrate the composer's mastery of harmony, counterpoint, and composition.\n\n## Composers who wrote multiple sets\n\nSome composers have written multiple sets of 24 pieces, each with its own unique characteristics. For example, Johann Sebastian Bach wrote two sets of preludes and fugues, known as The Well-Tempered Clavier, Books I and II. Each book contains 24 pieces, covering all major and minor keys. Similarly, Fr√©d√©ric Chopin wrote 24 Preludes, Op. 28, and 24 Etudes, Op. 10 and Op. 25.\n\n# Variants\n\nWhile the traditional concept of music written in all major or minor keys involves a set of 24 pieces, there are several variants that deviate from this structure.\n\n## Single pieces that modulate through many keys\n\nSome composers have written single pieces that modulate through many keys, creating a sense of tonal journey. For example, Franz Liszt's \"La Campanella\" is a piano piece that modulates through several keys, showcasing the composer's technical skill and expressive range.\n\n## Works covering all eight church modes\n\nThe church modes, also known as the Gregorian modes, are a set of eight musical modes used in Gregorian chant. Some composers have written works that cover all eight church modes, rather than the traditional major and minor keys. For example, Olivier Messiaen's \"Mode de valeurs et d'intensit√©s\" is a piece for piano that explores all eight church modes.\n\n## Other sets of 24 pieces\n\nThere are also sets of 24 pieces that cover different aspects of music, such as rhythm, timbre, or dynamics. For example, Karlheinz Stockhausen's \"Klavierst√ºcke\" is a set of 24 pieces for piano that explores different rhythmic and timbral possibilities.\n\n# Keys\n\nThe order of keys in published works can vary, but the most common order is to start with the key of C major and proceed in a clockwise direction around the circle of fifths.\n\n## Order of keys in published works\n\nThe order of keys in published works is often determined by the composer or publisher. For example, Bach's \"The Well-Tempered Clavier\" starts with the key of C major and proceeds in a clockwise direction around the circle of fifths. Similarly, Chopin's \"24 Preludes\" start with the key of C major and follow a similar pattern.\n\n# History\n\nThe concept of music written in all major or minor keys has a long history, dating back to the Baroque period.\n\n## Bach and his precursors\n\nJohann Sebastian Bach was not the first composer to write music in all major or minor keys. For example, the Italian composer Girolamo Frescobaldi wrote a set of 12 toccatas, each in a different key, in the early 17th century. However, Bach's \"The Well-Tempered Clavier\" is considered a landmark work in the history of Western classical music.\n\n## After Bach\n\nAfter Bach, several composers wrote sets of 24 pieces that covered all major and minor keys. For example, the German composer Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach wrote a set of 24 sonatas, each in a different key.\n\n### 18th and 19th centuries\n\n#### 1750‚Äì1850\n\nDuring the Classical period, composers such as Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven wrote music in all major and minor keys. For example, Haydn's \"48 Piano Sonatas\" cover all major and minor keys, although not in a single set of 24 pieces.\n\n#### 1851‚Äì1900\n\nDuring the Romantic period, composers such as Chopin, Liszt, and Brahms wrote music in all major and minor keys. For example, Chopin's \"24 Preludes\" and \"24 Etudes\" are considered some of the most technically challenging and expressive pieces in the piano repertoire.\n\n### 20th century\n\n#### 1901‚Äì1950\n\nDuring the early 20th century, composers such as Schoenberg, Berg, and Webern wrote music in all major and minor keys, although often in a more experimental and avant-garde style. For example, Schoenberg's \"24 Preludes\" are a set of 24 pieces for piano that explore different tonal and atonal possibilities.\n\n#### 1951‚Äì2000\n\nDuring the mid-20th century, composers such as Messiaen, Boulez, and Stockhausen wrote music in all major and minor keys, often incorporating elements of serialism and aleatoric music. For example, Messiaen's \"Mode de valeurs et d'intensit√©s\" is a piece for piano that explores all eight church modes.\n\n### 21st century\n\nIn the 21st century, composers continue to write music in all major and minor keys, often incorporating elements of technology and multimedia. For example, the American composer John Adams has written a set of 24 pieces for piano that explore different tonal and rhythmic possibilities.\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article provides an overview of the concept of music written in all major or minor keys. From Bach's \"The Well-Tempered Clavier\" to contemporary works, this concept has been explored by composers throughout history, resulting in a diverse range of works that showcase technical skill and creativity.\n\n# References\n\nThis article does not include references or citations.\n\n# External links\n\nThis article does not include external links.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Music_written_in_all_major_or_minor_keys\" following this outline:\n\n#Notable sets that cover all 24 keys\n##Composers who wrote multiple sets\n#Variants\n##Single pieces that modulate through many keys\n##Works covering all eight church modes\n##Other sets of 24 pieces\n#Keys\n##Order of keys in published works\n#History\n##Bach and his precursors\n##After Bach\n###18th and 19th centuries\n####1750‚Äì1850\n####1851‚Äì1900\n###20th century\n####1901‚Äì1950\n####1951‚Äì2000\n###21st century\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
