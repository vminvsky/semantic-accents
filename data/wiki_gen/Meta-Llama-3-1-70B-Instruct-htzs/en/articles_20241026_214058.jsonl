Reindeer are known for their distinctive antlers, thick coats, and ability to survive in harsh, cold climates. They are an important part of the ecosystems in which they live, and play a vital role in the cultures and traditions of many indigenous communities.\n\nDescription\n------------\n\nReindeer are members of the deer family (Cervidae) and are closely related to other deer species such as moose and elk. They are medium-sized animals, with adults typically weighing between 100 and 500 kg (220-1,100 lb). Reindeer have a distinctive body shape, with a compact torso, long legs, and a short tail. They have a thick coat of fur that helps to keep them warm in cold temperatures, and their fur can be brown, gray, or white in color.\n\nStatus\n-------\n\nReindeer are listed as \"vulnerable\" on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List. Their populations are declining in many parts of their range due to habitat loss, hunting, and climate change. In some areas, reindeer are considered an important food source and are hunted for their meat, while in other areas they are considered a nuisance and are hunted to control their populations.\n\nNaming\n-------\n\nThe term \"reindeer\" is often used to refer to the species as a whole, while the term \"caribou\" is used to refer specifically to the North American subspecies. The term \"reindeer\" comes from the Old Norse word \"hreinn,\" which means \" deer,\" while the term \"caribou\" comes from the Mi'kmaq word \"kalibu,\" which means \"shoveler\" or \" pawer.\"\n\nEvolution\n----------\n\nReindeer evolved from a common ancestor with other deer species during the Pleistocene era. The exact timing of their evolution is unclear, but it is thought that reindeer evolved in response to the changing climate of the Arctic region. Over time, reindeer developed a range of adaptations that allowed them to survive in the harsh, cold conditions of the Arctic, including their thick coats, antlers, and specialized digestive system.\n\nTaxonomy\n---------\n\n### Naming and research on museum collections\n\nThe taxonomy of reindeer has been the subject of much debate and research. In the 19th century, many museums and collectors were interested in acquiring reindeer specimens for their collections. This led to a large number of reindeer being collected and studied, and many new subspecies were described.\n\n### Biological exploration expeditions\n\nIn the early 20th century, a number of biological exploration expeditions were conducted to study the reindeer and their habitats. These expeditions helped to shed light on the ecology and behavior of reindeer, and led to a greater understanding of their taxonomy.\n\n### Reclassification\n\nIn recent years, there has been a reclassification of reindeer subspecies based on genetic and molecular evidence. This has led to a greater understanding of the relationships between different reindeer populations, and has helped to clarify the taxonomy of the species.\n\n#### Ecotypes\n\nReindeer can be divided into a number of ecotypes, each of which is adapted to a specific environment. These ecotypes include the arctic tundra ecotype, the boreal forest ecotype, and the mountain ecotype.\n\n#### Genetic, molecular, and archaeological evidence\n\nRecent studies have used genetic, molecular, and archaeological evidence to study the relationships between different reindeer populations. These studies have helped to shed light on the evolution and dispersal of reindeer, and have provided a greater understanding of their taxonomy.\n\n#### Novel genetics-based clades\n\nRecent genetic studies have identified a number of novel clades within the reindeer species. These clades are based on genetic differences between different reindeer populations, and have helped to clarify the taxonomy of the species.\n\nSpecies and subspecies\n----------------------\n\nThere are several subspecies of reindeer, including:\n\n* Rangifer tarandus tarandus (the Arctic reindeer)\n* Rangifer tarandus caribou (the North American caribou)\n* Rangifer tarandus pearyi (the Peary caribou)\n* Rangifer tarandus granti (the Grant's caribou)\n* Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus (the Greenland caribou)\n\nPhysical characteristics\n------------------------\n\n### Antlers\n\nReindeer have distinctive antlers that are grown by both males and females. The antlers are made of bone and are grown each year, with the old antlers being shed in the spring. The antlers are used for fighting, defense, and attracting mates.\n\n### Pelt\n\nReindeer have a thick coat of fur that helps to keep them warm in cold temperatures. The fur can be brown, gray, or white in color, and is often white on the belly and dark on the back.\n\n### Heat exchange\n\nReindeer have a specialized heat exchange system that helps to conserve heat in cold temperatures. This system involves the circulation of warm blood through the legs and feet, which helps to warm the cold blood returning from the feet.\n\n### Hooves\n\nReindeer have hooves that are adapted for walking on snow and ice. The hooves are made of keratin and are shaped like a crescent moon, which helps to provide traction on slippery surfaces.\n\n### Size\n\nReindeer are medium-sized animals, with adults typically weighing between 100 and 500 kg (220-1,100 lb).\n\n### Clicking sound\n\nReindeer make a distinctive clicking sound with their hooves, which is used for communication and mating.\n\n### Eyes\n\nReindeer have large eyes that are adapted for seeing in low light conditions. The eyes are also very sensitive to movement, which helps to detect predators.\n\nBiology and behaviors\n----------------------\n\n### Seasonal body composition\n\nReindeer have a seasonal body composition that changes depending on the availability of food. In the summer, reindeer eat as much as possible to build up fat reserves, which are then used to sustain them during the winter when food is scarce.\n\n### Reproduction and life cycle\n\nReindeer breed in the fall, with the males engaging in a series of battles for dominance and mating rights. The females give birth to a single calf in the spring, which is then nursed for several months before being weaned.\n\n### Social structure, migration and range\n\nReindeer are social animals that live in herds. The herds are typically made up of females and their young, while the males will often wander on their own or form bachelor groups. Reindeer migrate long distances each year, with some populations traveling over 3,000 miles (4,800 km) between their summer and winter ranges.\n\nEcology\n--------\n\n### Distribution and habitat\n\nReindeer are found in the Arctic and subarctic regions of the world, including Alaska, Canada, Russia, and Scandinavia. They inhabit a variety of habitats, including tundra, forests, and mountains.\n\n### Diet\n\nReindeer are herbivores and eat a variety of plants, including grasses, leaves, and lichens. In the winter, they will also eat mosses and other non-vascular plants.\n\n### Predators\n\nReindeer have a number of predators, including wolves, bears, and humans.\n\n### Other threats\n\nReindeer are also threatened by habitat loss, climate change, and disease.\n\nConservation\n------------\n\n### Current status\n\nReindeer are listed as \"vulnerable\" on the IUCN Red List. Their populations are declining in many parts of their range due to habitat loss, hunting, and climate change.\n\n### Boreal woodland caribou\n\nThe boreal woodland caribou is a subspecies of reindeer that is found in the boreal forests of Canada and Alaska. They are listed as \"threatened\" on the IUCN Red List and are protected by law in Canada.\n\n### Peary caribou\n\nThe Peary caribou is a subspecies of reindeer that is found in the Arctic tundra of Canada and Alaska. They are listed as \"endangered\" on the IUCN Red List and are protected by law in Canada.\n\nRelationship with humans\n----------------------\n\n### Indigenous North Americans\n\nReindeer have been an important part of the culture and traditions of many indigenous North American communities for thousands of years. They are hunted for their meat, hides, and antlers, and are also used for transportation and clothing.\n\n### Indigenous Eurasians\n\nReindeer have also been an important part of the culture and traditions of many indigenous Eurasian communities for thousands of years. They are hunted for their meat, hides, and antlers, and are also used for transportation and clothing.\n\n### Husbandry\n\nReindeer are also raised in captivity for their meat, hides, and antlers. They are typically raised on large farms or ranches, where they are fed a diet of hay and grains.\n\n### History\n\nReindeer have been an important part of human history for thousands of years. They were first domesticated in Siberia around 2,000 years ago, and were later introduced to Europe and North America.\n\n### Santa Claus\n\nReindeer are also famous for their association with Santa Claus, who is said to use them to pull his sleigh on Christmas Eve.\n\n### Mythology and art\n\nReindeer have also been featured in many mythologies and works of art throughout history. They are often depicted as powerful and majestic animals, and are associated with the winter solstice and the changing of the seasons.\n\n### Heraldry and symbols\n\nReindeer are also used as a symbol in heraldry, where they are often depicted on coats of arms and other symbols of nobility.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Caribou\n* Reindeer herding\n* Sami people\n* Inuit\n* Christmas\n\nNotes\n------\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nBibliography\n------------\n\nExternal links\n---------------\n\nCaribou-specific links (North America)\n-------------------------------------\n\n* Caribou Management Board\n* North American Caribou Workshop\n* Caribou Conservation Breeding Program", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Reindeer\" following this outline:\n\n#Description\n#Status\n#Naming\n#Evolution\n#Taxonomy\n##Naming and research on museum collections\n##Biological exploration expeditions\n##Reclassification\n###Ecotypes\n###Genetic, molecular, and archaeological evidence\n###Novel genetics-based clades\n#Species and subspecies\n#Physical characteristics\n##Antlers\n##Pelt\n##Heat exchange\n##Hooves\n##Size\n##Clicking sound\n##Eyes\n#Biology and behaviors\n##Seasonal body composition\n##Reproduction and life cycle\n##Social structure, migration and range\n#Ecology\n##Distribution and habitat\n##Diet\n##Predators\n##Other threats\n#Conservation\n##Current status\n##Boreal woodland caribou\n##Peary caribou\n#Relationship with humans\n##Indigenous North Americans\n##Indigenous Eurasians\n##Husbandry\n##History\n##Santa Claus\n##Mythology and art\n##Heraldry and symbols\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n##Caribou-specific links (North America)\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The battle was a key component of the larger Eastern Ukraine campaign during the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n#Background\n\nBakhmut is a strategically important city located in the Donetsk Oblast, approximately 55 kilometers (34 miles) north of Donetsk city. Prior to the Russian invasion, the city had a population of around 72,000 people and was a significant industrial and cultural hub. The city's location in the Donbas region made it a crucial prize for both Ukrainian and Russian forces, as control of the area would grant access to key transportation routes, industrial resources, and population centers.\n\n#Battle\n\n##Early shelling and Russian encroachment (August–October 2022)\n\nIn August 2022, Russian forces began a prolonged artillery bombardment of Bakhmut, with daily shelling causing significant damage to the city's infrastructure and civilian population. Ukrainian forces responded with counter-battery fire, but the Russian encroachment continued, with Wagner Group mercenaries playing a key role in the ground assault. By October 2022, Russian forces had established a foothold in the outskirts of the city, leading to intense urban warfare.\n\n##Early winter escalation (November–December 2022)\n\nAs winter approached, the battle for Bakhmut intensified, with both sides suffering heavy casualties. Russian forces launched a series of human-wave attacks, which were repeatedly repelled by Ukrainian defenders. Despite the harsh winter conditions, Ukrainian forces managed to maintain their defensive lines, but the city's infrastructure and civilian population continued to suffer.\n\n##Capture of Soledar and partial encirclement (January–April 2023)\n\nIn January 2023, Russian forces captured the nearby town of Soledar, which gave them control of key high ground and allowed them to partially encircle Bakhmut. Ukrainian forces responded with a series of counterattacks, but the Russian encirclement tightened, putting the city's defenders under increasing pressure.\n\n##Ukrainian flanking counterattacks begin (May 2023)\n\nIn May 2023, Ukrainian forces launched a series of flanking counterattacks aimed at relieving the pressure on Bakhmut and pushing Russian forces back. The counterattacks were supported by significant artillery and air power, and managed to create small breaches in the Russian lines.\n\n##Capture of Bakhmut and Wagner withdrawal (20 May–early June 2023)\n\nOn May 20, 2023, Russian forces, led by Wagner Group mercenaries, captured the city center of Bakhmut, marking a significant turning point in the battle. However, the capture came at a high cost, with Wagner Group suffering heavy casualties. In early June 2023, Wagner Group mercenaries began to withdraw from the city, citing heavy losses and a need to regroup.\n\n#Military strength and tactics\n\nBoth Ukrainian and Russian forces employed a range of tactics during the battle, including artillery bombardments, human-wave attacks, and urban warfare. Ukrainian forces relied heavily on their artillery and air power to repel Russian attacks, while Russian forces used their numerical superiority to try and overwhelm Ukrainian defenders. The Wagner Group mercenaries played a key role in the Russian ground assault, but their tactics were often criticized for being brutal and ineffective.\n\n#Aftermath\n\n##Strategic value\n\nThe capture of Bakhmut gave Russian forces control of a key transportation hub and access to the Donetsk region. However, the city's infrastructure and civilian population were severely damaged, and the city's strategic value was diminished.\n\n##Battlefield conditions\n\nThe battlefield around Bakhmut was severely damaged, with widespread destruction of buildings, roads, and infrastructure. The city's civilian population suffered significantly, with many residents forced to flee or take shelter in basements and bunkers.\n\n##Casualties\n\n###Military casualties\n\nEstimates of military casualties vary widely, but it is believed that both Ukrainian and Russian forces suffered heavy losses. Wagner Group mercenaries were particularly hard hit, with some estimates suggesting that they lost up to 80% of their forces.\n\n###Civilian casualties\n\nCivilian casualties were significant, with many residents killed or injured in the fighting. The exact number of civilian casualties is unknown, but it is believed to be in the thousands.\n\n##Attrition\n\nThe battle for Bakhmut was a war of attrition, with both sides suffering heavy losses. The Russian capture of the city came at a high cost, and it is unclear whether the strategic value of the ci", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Battle_of_Bakhmut\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Battle\n##Early shelling and Russian encroachment (August–October 2022)\n##Early winter escalation (November–December 2022)\n##Capture of Soledar and partial encirclement (January–April 2023)\n##Ukrainian flanking counterattacks begin (May 2023)\n##Capture of Bakhmut and Wagner withdrawal (20 May–early June 2023)\n#Military strength and tactics\n#Aftermath\n##Strategic value\n##Battlefield conditions\n##Casualties\n###Military casualties\n###Civilian casualties\n##Attrition\n##Result\n#Allegations of war crimes\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The invasion marked a significant escalation of the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which had been simmering since 2014. The invasion has resulted in thousands of deaths, widespread destruction, and a massive humanitarian crisis.\n\n# Background\n\n## Post-Soviet relations\n\nFollowing the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine and Russia established diplomatic relations. However, the relationship between the two countries was complicated by issues such as energy dependence, border disputes, and conflicting views on NATO expansion. In 2004, the Orange Revolution brought pro-Western President Viktor Yushchenko to power, which led to a deterioration in relations with Russia.\n\n## Ukrainian revolution, Russian intervention in Crimea and Donbas\n\nIn 2013, Ukraine's then-President Viktor Yanukovych suspended plans to sign an association agreement with the European Union, sparking protests in Kiev. The protests eventually led to Yanukovych's ouster in February 2014. Russia responded by annexing Crimea in March 2014 and supporting separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine, particularly in the Donbas region. The conflict in Donbas resulted in over 14,000 deaths and the displacement of millions of people.\n\n# Prelude\n\n## Putin's invasion announcement\n\nOn February 24, 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a \"special military operation\" in Ukraine, citing the need to protect ethnic Russians and Russian-speaking populations in Ukraine. Putin also claimed that Ukraine was planning to join NATO, which he saw as a threat to Russia's national security.\n\n# Events\n\n## Initial invasion (24 February – 7 April)\n\n### Kyiv and northern front\n\nRussian forces launched a multi-pronged attack on Ukraine, with a major thrust towards the capital city of Kyiv.

However, the Russians did manage to capture the city of Chernobyl, which is home to the infamous nuclear power plant.\n\n### Northeastern front\n\nRussian forces also launched an attack on the northeastern city of Kharkiv, which is Ukraine's second-largest city. The Ukrainian military defended the city, but the Russians did manage to capture several surrounding towns and villages.\n\n### Southern front\n\nRussian forces also attacked the southern city of Mariupol, which is a strategic port city on the Sea of Azov. The city was heavily damaged, and thousands of civilians were killed or displaced.\n\n### Eastern front\n\nRussian forces also launched an attack on the eastern city of Donetsk, which is the capital of the Donetsk People's Republic, a separatist region supported by Russia. The Ukrainian military defended the city, but the Russians did manage to capture several surrounding towns and villages.\n\n## Southeastern front (8 April – 5 September)\n\n### Fall of Mariupol\n\nAfter a prolonged siege, Mariupol fell to Russian forces on May 20, 2022. The city was heavily damaged, and thousands of civilians were killed or displaced.\n\n### Fall of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk\n\nRussian forces also captured the cities of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk in the Luhansk region. The Ukrainian military defended the cities, but they were eventually forced to retreat.\n\n### Kharkiv front\n\nRussian forces continued to attack the city of Kharkiv, but the Ukrainian military defended the city. The Russians did manage to capture several surrounding towns and villages.\n\n### Kherson-Mykolaiv front\n\nRussian forces also attacked the cities of Kherson and Mykolaiv, which are strategic ports on the Black Sea. The Ukrainian military defended the cities, but the Russians did manage to capture several surrounding towns and villages.\n\n### Zaporizhzhia front\n\nRussian forces also attacked the city of Zaporizhzhia, which is a strategic port on the Dnieper River.

The annexation was widely condemned by the international community.\n\n### Zaporizhzhia front\n\nUkrainian forces launched a counterattack on the Zaporizhzhia front, recapturing several towns and villages.\n\n### Kherson counteroffensive\n\nUkrainian forces also launched a counterattack on the Kherson front, recapturing several towns and villages.\n\n### Kharkiv counteroffensive\n\nUkrainian forces launched a counterattack on the Kharkiv front, recapturing several towns and villages.\n\n## Winter stalemate, attrition campaign and military surge (12 November 2022 – 7 June 2023)\n\n### Battle of Bakhmut\n\nThe battle of Bakhmut was a prolonged and intense battle between Ukrainian and Russian forces.

The outbreak occurred over a four-day period, producing numerous tornadoes across multiple states. The event was characterized by a complex and dynamic weather pattern, which led to the development of a prolonged and intense period of severe weather.\n\n#Meteorological synopsis\n\nThe outbreak was fueled by a strong and complex weather system that developed over the southern Plains on December 11, 2022. A potent low-pressure system formed over eastern New Mexico, which began to move eastward and intensify. As the system interacted with a strong cold front, a dry line, and a warm front, it created a highly unstable atmosphere that was conducive to severe thunderstorm development.\n\nOn December 12, a strong upper-level disturbance moved into the region, providing additional lift and instability. This led to the development of a large-scale severe weather outbreak, characterized by numerous supercells and a significant tornado threat. The outbreak continued through December 13, with the worst of the severe weather occurring during the late afternoon and evening hours.\n\nOn December 14, the low-pressure system and its associated fronts began to move eastward, bringing the severe weather threat into the Southeastern United States. The outbreak continued through December 15, with the last of the severe weather occurring in the late morning hours.\n\n#Confirmed tornadoes\n\nA total of 124 tornadoes were confirmed during the outbreak, with the majority occurring on December 12 and 13.

The most significant tornado of the day was a long-lived EF3 tornado that touched down in northwestern Texas, causing significant damage and injuring several people.\n\n##December 13 event\n\nOn December 13, a total of 43 tornadoes were confirmed, with the majority occurring in Arkansas and Louisiana. The most significant tornado of the day was a devastating EF4 tornado that touched down in central Arkansas, causing widespread destruction and killing several people.\n\n##December 14 event\n\nOn December 14, a total of 20 tornadoes were confirmed, with the majority occurring in Mississippi and Alabama. The most significant tornado of the day was a long-lived EF2 tornado that touched down in eastern Mississippi, causing significant damage and injuring several people.\n\n##December 15 event\n\nOn December 15, a total of 6 tornadoes were confirmed, with the majority occurring in Georgia. The most significant tornado of the day was a weak EF1 tornado that touched down in northwestern Georgia, causing minor damage.\n\n##Farmerville, Louisiana\n\nOn December 13, a devastating tornado outbreak occurred in Farmerville, Louisiana, resulting in significant damage and loss of life. A total of 5 tornadoes were confirmed in the area, with the most significant being an EF4 tornado that touched down in the city. The tornado caused widespread destruction, including the complete destruction of a large apartment complex. Several people were killed, and many more were injured.\n\n#Non-tornadic effects\n\nIn addition to the tornadoes, the outbreak produced significant non-tornadic effects, including damaging winds, large hail, and heavy rainfall. The strongest winds were reported in Texas, where gusts reached up to 80 mph. The largest hail was reported in Oklahoma, where hailstones reached up to 2 inches in diameter. Heavy rainfall was reported across multiple states, with totals reaching up to 6 inches in some areas.\n\n#Impact\n\nThe outbreak had a significant impact on the affected areas, with widespread damage and disruption.

The movie follows the story of Saul Goodman, a small-time lawyer who becomes embroiled in a complex web of crime and deception. The film explores themes of identity, morality, and the consequences of one's actions.\n\n#Plot\n\nThe movie takes place after the events of Better Call Saul and follows Saul Goodman, played by Bob Odenkirk, as he navigates a new reality. The story begins with Saul living in hiding, using the alias \"Gene Takavic\" and working as a manager at a Cinnabon store in Omaha, Nebraska. However, his life is disrupted when he is recognized by a group of locals who threaten to expose his true identity.\n\nAs Saul tries to maintain his cover, he becomes embroiled in a series of misadventures, including a botched heist and a run-in with a pair of ruthless thugs. Along the way, he encounters a number of familiar characters from the Breaking Bad universe, including Kim Wexler, played by Rhea Seehorn, and Ed Galbraith, played by Robert Forster.\n\nThroughout the film, Saul is forced to confront the consequences of his past actions and the moral compromises he has made. As he navigates this complex web of relationships and alliances, he must also contend with his own sense of identity and the persona he has created for himself.\n\n#Production\n\n##Development\n\nThe idea for Saul Gone originated with Vince Gilligan, the creator of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul. Gilligan had always envisioned a feature film continuation of the series and saw an opportunity to explore the character of Saul Goodman in greater depth.\n\nIn an interview, Gilligan explained that he wanted to create a film that would be both a satisfying conclusion to the series and a standalone story that could be enjoyed by new viewers. He worked closely with writer and director Peter Gould to develop the script and bring the story to life.\n\n##Casting\n\nThe cast of Saul Gone includes a number of familiar faces from the Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul universe. Bob Odenkirk reprises his role as Saul Goodman, while Rhea Seehorn returns as Kim Wexler.

The incident began in November 2022, when Biden's lawyers discovered a batch of classified documents at the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement, a think tank affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania. Since then, additional classified documents have been found at Biden's Wilmington, Delaware home and other locations.\n\n#Background\n\nJoe Biden served as Vice President of the United States from 2009 to 2017, under President Barack Obama. During his time in office, Biden had access to sensitive and classified information. After leaving office, Biden established the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement, a think tank affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania, where he maintained an office.\n\n#Discoveries and other developments\n\n##First batch of documents\n\nIn November 2022, Biden's lawyers discovered a batch of classified documents at the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement. The documents were reportedly found in a locked closet in Biden's office. The discovery was made by Biden's lawyers, who were conducting a review of the documents stored at the center. The lawyers immediately notified the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) about the discovery.\n\n##DOJ letter to Bob Bauer\n\nIn December 2022, the DOJ sent a letter to Bob Bauer, Biden's personal lawyer, requesting that the White House take steps to protect the classified documents until they could be properly reviewed and returned to the National Archives. The letter was written by the DOJ's National Security Division and was signed by the division's chief, Matthew Olsen.\n\n##Second batch of documents\n\nOn January 12, 2023, Biden's lawyers announced that they had discovered a second batch of classified documents at Biden's Wilmington, Delaware home. The documents were found in a storage room in the garage of Biden's home. The discovery was made during a search of the property, which was conducted by Biden's lawyers in response to the initial discovery of classified documents at the Penn Biden Center.\n\n##FBI search of Biden's Wilmington home\n\nOn January 21, 2023, the FBI conducted a search of Biden's Wilmington, Delaware home, as part of the ongoing investigation into the classified documents. The search was conducted by a team of FBI agents, who were accompanied by Biden's lawyers. The search lasted for several hours and resulted in the discovery of additional classified documents.\n\n##Other searches\n\nIn addition to the search of Biden's Wilmington home, the FBI also conducted searches of other locations, including the Penn Biden Center and Biden's Rehoboth Beach, Delaware home. The searches were part of the ongoing investigation into the classified documents and were conducted by teams of FBI agents.\n\n#Initial responses\n\n##Biden and his legal team\n\nBiden and his legal team have maintained that the discovery of the classified documents was an honest mistake and that they have cooperated fully with the investigation. In a statement, Biden said that he was \"surprised\" by the discovery of the documents and that he had not been aware of their existence.\n\n##Elected officials\n\n###Republican elected officials\n\nRepublican elected officials have criticized Biden's handling of the classified documents, with some calling for his impeachment. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas said that Biden's actions were \"inexcusable\" and that he had \"compromised national security.\"\n\n###Democratic elected officials\n\nDemocratic elected officials have defended Biden's handling of the classified documents, with some saying that the incident was a \"mistake\" and that Biden had cooperated fully with the investigation. Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois said that Biden had \"done the right thing\" by notifying the National Archives and the DOJ about the discovery of the documents.\n\n##Media analysis\n\nMedia analysts have offered mixed opinions on the incident, with some saying that it was a serious breach of national security and others saying that it was a minor mistake. Some analysts have noted that the incident has raised questions about Biden's handling of classified information and his ability to protect national security.\n\n##Misinformation\n\nThe incident has also been the subject of misinformation, with some social media users spreading false claims about the discovery of the documents and Biden's handling of the incident. Fact-checkers have debunked several of these claims, including a false claim that Biden had intentionally hidden the documents.\n\n##Discovery of classified documents at Mike Pence's residence\n\nIn February 2023, it was reported that classified documents had been discovered at the residence of former Vice President Mike Pence. The discovery was made by Pence's lawyers, who were conducting a review of the documents stored at his home. The incident has raised questions about the handling of classified information by former government officials and the need for greater transparency and accountability.\n\n#Investigations\n\n##Special counsel\n\nIn January 2023, Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed a special counsel to investigate the discovery of the classified documents. The special counsel, Robert Hur, is a former federal prosecutor who has experience handling national security cases.\n\n###Decision that charges were unwarranted\n\nIn March 2023, the special counsel announced that no charges would be brought against Biden in connection with the discovery of the classified documents. The decision was made after a thorough investigation, which included interviews with Biden and his staff.\n\n###Comments on Biden's memory\n\nThe special counsel also made comments about Biden's memory, saying that Biden had been \"forthcoming\" about his handling of the classified documents and that he had not intentionally tried to conceal them. The comments were seen as a rebuke to critics who had questioned Biden's memory and his ability to serve as President.\n\n##Congressional\n\nIn addition to the special counsel's investigation, Congress has also launched its own investigation into the discovery of the classified documents. The investigation is being led by the House Oversight Committee, which has subpoenaed documents and witnesses in connection with the incident.\n\n#See also\n\n* Classified information in the United States\n* National Archives and Records Administration\n* Department of Justice\n* Federal Bureau of Investigation\n* Special counsel", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Joe_Biden_classified_documents_incident\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Discoveries and other developments\n##First batch of documents\n##DOJ letter to Bob Bauer\n##Second batch of documents\n##FBI search of Biden's Wilmington home\n##Other searches\n#Initial responses\n##Biden and his legal team\n##Elected officials\n###Republican elected officials\n###Democratic elected officials\n##Media analysis\n##Misinformation\n##Discovery of classified documents at Mike Pence's residence\n#Investigations\n##Special counsel\n###Decision that charges were unwarranted\n###Comments on Biden's memory\n##Congressional\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He is the recipient of the Victoria Cross for Australia, the country's highest military honor, for his actions in Afghanistan in 2010. After leaving the military, Roberts-Smith went on to pursue a career in corporate affairs and has been involved in various other activities. However, his post-military life has been marred by controversy, including allegations of war crimes and a high-profile defamation suit.\n\nEarly life and family\n--------------------\n\nBen Roberts-Smith was born on November 1, 1978, in Perth, Western Australia. He grew up in a military family and was educated at Hale School, a private boys' school in Perth. After completing his secondary education, Roberts-Smith joined the Australian Army in 1996.\n\nMilitary career\n----------------\n\nRoberts-Smith enlisted in the Australian Army in 1996 and underwent recruit training at the Army Recruit Training Centre in Kapooka, New South Wales. He was then posted to the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3 RAR), where he served as an infantry soldier. In 2003, Roberts-Smith was selected to join the Special Air Service Regiment (SASR), one of the Australian Army's most elite units.\n\nDuring his time in the SASR, Roberts-Smith served in various roles, including as a patrol commander and a sniper. He deployed on multiple occasions to Afghanistan and Iraq, where he was involved in numerous combat operations.\n\n### Military decorations\n\nRoberts-Smith's military decorations include the Victoria Cross for Australia, the Medal for Gallantry, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, and the Iraq Campaign Medal. He was awarded the Victoria Cross for Australia in 2011 for his actions in Afghanistan in 2010, when he led a patrol that came under heavy fire from Taliban insurgents. Roberts-Smith's citation for the Victoria Cross reads: \"For the most conspicuous gallantry in action in circumstances of extreme peril as a patrol commander, Special Air Service Regiment, in the Kandahar Province, Afghanistan, on 11 June 2010.\"\n\nCorporate career\n----------------\n\nAfter leaving the Australian Army in 2013, Roberts-Smith pursued a career in corporate affairs. He joined the Seven Network, a major Australian media company, as the general manager of Seven Queensland. In 2016, he was appointed as the chief executive officer of the Seven Network's Queensland operations.\n\nOther activities\n----------------\n\nIn addition to his corporate career, Roberts-Smith has been involved in various other activities. He has worked as a commentator for the Seven Network, providing analysis on military and defense issues. He has also been involved in various charitable organizations, including the Australian War Memorial and the SAS Resources Fund.\n\nWar crime allegations\n---------------------\n\nIn 2020, Roberts-Smith was the subject of allegations of war crimes committed during his time in Afghanistan. The allegations, which were first reported by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), related to the deaths of several Afghan civilians who were allegedly killed by Roberts-Smith and other members of the SASR.\n\n### Investigation\n\nThe allegations against Roberts-Smith were investigated by the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and the Inspector-General of the Australian Defence Force (IGADF). The IGADF's report, which was released in 2020, found that there was sufficient evidence to suggest that Roberts-Smith and other members of the SASR had committed war crimes in Afghanistan. However, the report did not make any specific recommendations regarding charges or disciplinary action.\n\nDefamation suit\n----------------\n\nIn 2020, Roberts-Smith launched a defamation suit against the ABC and several of its journalists, including Nick McKenzie and Chris Masters, over the reporting of the war crime allegations. The suit alleged that the ABC's reporting was defamatory and that it had damaged Roberts-Smith's reputation.\n\n### Judgment\n\nIn 2022, the Federal Court of Australia delivered its judgment in the defamation suit. The court found that the ABC's reporting was not defamatory and that Roberts-Smith had failed to prove that the allegations against him were false. The court also found that the ABC's reporting was protected by the defense of qualified privilege, which allows for the publication of defamatory material if it is in the public interest.\n\n### Appeal\n\nRoberts-Smith appealed the Federal Court's judgment to the Full Court of the Federal Court. However, the Full Court upheld the lower court's decision, finding that the ABC's reporting was not defamatory and that Roberts-Smith had failed to prove that the allegations against him were false.\n\nFurther controversy\n-------------------\n\nIn addition to the war crime allegations and the defamation suit, Roberts-Smith has been involved in further controversy. In 2022, it was reported that he had been involved in a physical altercation with a woman at a hotel in Sydney. The incident was investigated by the New South Wales Police, but no charges were laid.\n\nPersonal life\n-------------\n\nRoberts-Smith is married to Emma Roberts-Smith, and the couple has two children together. He is a keen sportsman and has competed in several Ironman triathlons.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nExternal links\n--------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Ben_Roberts-Smith\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and family\n#Military career\n##Military decorations\n#Corporate career\n#Other activities\n#War crime allegations\n##Investigation\n#Defamation suit\n##Judgment\n##Appeal\n#Further controversy\n#Personal life\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

His impressive athletic career was followed by a successful acting career, and he also devoted himself to various social causes, particularly the Civil Rights Movement.\n\n#Early life\n\nJim Brown was born to Swinton Brown, a professional boxer, and Theresa Brown, a homemaker. His father was of Creole descent, and his mother was of Native American and African American ancestry. Brown's family moved to Long Island, New York, when he was two years old. He grew up in a low-income household with his mother, who worked multiple jobs to support the family. Brown's athletic talent was evident from an early age, and he excelled in multiple sports, including football, basketball, and lacrosse, at Manhasset Secondary School.\n\n#College career\n\nBrown attended Syracuse University on a football scholarship, where he played for the Syracuse Orange football team from 1954 to 1956. During his time at Syracuse, he was an exceptional player, earning All-American honors in both football and lacrosse. Brown's impressive collegiate career caught the attention of NFL scouts, and he was drafted by the Cleveland Browns in the first round of the 1957 NFL Draft.\n\n#Professional career\n\nBrown played for the Cleveland Browns from 1957 to 1965, earning numerous accolades, including nine Pro Bowl appearances, eight First-team All-Pro selections, and two NFL championships (1957 and 1964).

The Reformation had far-reaching consequences for the development of Western society, culture, and politics, and its impact can still be felt today.\n\n# Terminology\n\nThe term \"Reformation\" comes from the Latin word \"reformatio,\" meaning \"restoration\" or \"renewal.\" It was first used by the German theologian and reformer Philip Melanchthon in 1542 to describe the movement initiated by Martin Luther. The term has since been adopted to describe the broader movement of theological and ecclesiastical reform that swept across Europe in the 16th century.\n\n# Background\n\n## Calamities\n\nThe late Middle Ages were marked by a series of calamities that weakened the Roman Catholic Church and created a sense of disillusionment among the laity. The Black Death, which ravaged Europe in the 14th century, led to widespread social and economic disruption. The Hundred Years' War between England and France also contributed to a sense of instability and disorder. The rise of nationalism and the growth of cities further eroded the Church's authority.\n\n## Late Medieval Christianity\n\n### Institutions\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church was the dominant institution in Western Europe during the late Middle Ages. It was a vast, hierarchical organization that controlled a significant portion of the continent's wealth and land. The Church's institutions, including monasteries, convents, and bishoprics, played a crucial role in the spiritual and social life of medieval society.\n\n### Clergy\n\nThe clergy were the Church's ruling class, and they wielded significant power and influence. However, the clergy were also seen as corrupt and worldly, and many were criticized for their failure to live up to the Church's ideals.\n\n### Papacy\n\nThe papacy was the highest authority in the Roman Catholic Church, and the Pope was seen as the successor to St. Peter. However, the papacy was also criticized for its corruption and abuse of power.\n\n### Partial and failed institutional reforms\n\nThere were several attempts to reform the Church's institutions and practices during the late Middle Ages. The Conciliar movement, which emerged in the 15th century, sought to limit the power of the papacy and promote greater democracy within the Church. However, these efforts ultimately failed to achieve significant reform.\n\n## Humanism and lay religion\n\nHumanism was a cultural and intellectual movement that emerged in the 15th century, emphasizing the study of classical Greek and Roman texts and the pursuit of individualism and human dignity.

He is often referred to as the \"Father of the Constitution\" for his role in drafting and promoting the United States Constitution and the Bill of Rights. Madison was a key figure in the drafting and ratification of the Constitution, and his leadership in the House of Representatives helped shape the nation's early years.\n\nEarly Life and Education\n------------------------\n\nMadison was born on March 16, 1751, in Port Conway, Virginia, to Colonel James Madison Sr. and Nelly Conway Madison. He was the oldest of 12 children, and his family was considered to be part of the planter class. Madison's early education took place at home, where he was tutored by his mother and later by a private tutor. In 1769, he attended the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University), where he studied Latin, Greek, mathematics, and philosophy. Madison's time at college had a significant impact on his intellectual development, and he became interested in the ideas of the Enlightenment.\n\nAmerican Revolution and Articles of Confederation\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nMadison's involvement in politics began during the American Revolution. In 1776, he was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates, where he played a key role in drafting the Virginia State Constitution. Madison was a strong supporter of the Patriot cause and worked closely with other prominent Virginians, including Thomas Jefferson and George Mason. After the war, Madison served in the Continental Congress, where he played a key role in shaping the nation's early government under the Articles of Confederation. However, Madison became increasingly frustrated with the weaknesses of the Articles and began to advocate for a stronger federal government.\n\nRatification of the Constitution\n---------------------------------\n\nIn 1787, Madison was a key delegate to the Constitutional Convention, where he played a leading role in drafting the United States Constitution. Madison's Virginia Plan, which called for a strong central government and representation based on population, was a key influence on the final document. After the Convention, Madison worked tirelessly to promote the Constitution and secure its ratification. He wrote several influential essays, including Federalist No. 10, which argued that a large republic would be more stable and less prone to factionalism than a small one. Madison's efforts helped secure the Constitution's ratification in 1788.\n\nCongressman and Party Leader (1789–1801)\n-----------------------------------------\n\n### Election to Congress\n\nIn 1789, Madison was elected to the United States House of Representatives, where he quickly became a leader of the Democratic-Republican Party. Madison's time in Congress was marked by his strong advocacy for individual liberties and limited government. He was a key opponent of the Alien and Sedition Acts, which he saw as a threat to civil liberties.\n\n### Bill of Rights\n\nMadison was also a key advocate for the Bill of Rights, which was adopted in 1791. He worked closely with George Mason to draft the amendments, which guaranteed individual liberties such as freedom of speech and the right to a fair trial.\n\n### Founding the Democratic–Republican Party\n\nIn the early 1790s, Madison helped found the Democratic-Republican Party, which opposed the Federalist Party's vision of a strong central government. Madison saw the Democratic-Republicans as a way to promote individual liberties and limited government.\n\n### Marriage and Family\n\nIn 1794, Madison married Dolley Payne Todd, a widow with one son. The couple had no children together, but Madison adopted Dolley's son from her previous marriage.\n\n### Adams Presidency\n\nDuring John Adams' presidency, Madison opposed the Alien and Sedition Acts and the Quasi-War with France. He saw these actions as a threat to civil liberties and an overreach of executive power.\n\nSecretary of State (1801–1809)\n------------------------------\n\nIn 1801, Madison was appointed Secretary of State by President Thomas Jefferson. Madison played a key role in negotiating the Louisiana Purchase, which doubled the size of the United States. He also helped negotiate the Treaty of Ghent, which ended the War of 1812.\n\n### 1808 Presidential Election\n\nIn 1808, Madison was elected President, succeeding Thomas Jefferson. He won the election by a landslide, carrying 122 electoral votes to Charles C. Pinckney's 47.\n\nPresidency (1809–1817)\n-------------------------\n\n### Inauguration and Cabinet\n\nMadison's inauguration took place on March 4, 1809. He appointed a cabinet that included Robert Smith as Secretary of State and William Eustis as Secretary of War.\n\n### War of 1812\n\n#### Prelude to War\n\nThe War of 1812 began in June 1812, when Madison asked Congress to declare war on Great Britain. The war was sparked by British impressment of American sailors and trade restrictions.\n\n#### Military Actions\n\nThe war was marked by several key battles, including the burning of Washington, D.C. by British troops and the American victory at the Battle of New Orleans. Madison's leadership during the war was marked by his commitment to civilian control of the military and his opposition to a national bank.\n\n### Postwar Period and Decline of the Federalist Opposition\n\nAfter the war, Madison's popularity surged, and he was able to pass several key pieces of legislation, including the Tariff of 1816 and the Second Bank of the United States. The Federalist Party, which had opposed the war, began to decline in influence.\n\n### Native American Policy\n\nMadison's Native American policy was marked by his support for Indian removal. He signed the Creek Treaty, which ceded large tracts of land in Georgia and Alabama to the United States.\n\n### Election of 1816\n\nIn 1816, Madison was re-elected, carrying 183 electoral votes to Rufus King's 34.\n\nPost-Presidency (1817–1836)\n---------------------------\n\n### Death\n\nMadison died on June 28, 1836, at his home in Montpelier, Virginia. He was buried on the estate, where his wife Dolley was also buried.\n\nPolitical and Religious Views\n-----------------------------\n\n### Federalism\n\nMadison was a strong supporter of federalism, which he saw as a way to balance individual liberties with national power. He believed in a strong central government, but also believed in the importance of state and local power.\n\n### Religion\n\nMadison was raised as an Episcopalian, but he later became a Deist. He believed in the importance of separation of church and state and opposed government support for religion.\n\nSlavery\n--------\n\nMadison owned slaves throughout his life, but he also believed in the importance of gradual emancipation. He freed some of his slaves in his will, but many others were sold to pay off his debts.\n\nLegacy\n--------\n\nMadison's legacy is complex and multifaceted. He is remembered as the \"Father of the Constitution\" and a key leader of the Democratic-Republican Party. He is also remembered for his commitment to individual liberties and limited government. However, his legacy is also marked by his ownership of slaves and his support for Indian removal.\n\nNotes\n------\n\nThis article is a comprehensive overview of James Madison's life and legacy.

From its humble beginnings in school dramas and nativity scenes to the modern-day opera houses, Ukrainian opera has evolved significantly over the years. This article provides an overview of the origins, development, and evolution of opera in Ukraine.\n\n#Origins\n\n##Shkilʹna dramy (school dramas)\n\nThe earliest forms of opera in Ukraine can be traced back to the 17th-century school dramas, known as \"shkilʹna dramy\". These dramas were performed by students in schools and were often based on biblical themes. They were an important part of the educational system, aiming to teach students about morality, ethics, and biblical stories. Over time, these school dramas evolved into more complex performances, incorporating music, singing, and acting.\n\n##Vertepy (nativity scenes)\n\nAnother significant influence on the development of Ukrainian opera was the \"vertepy\", a type of nativity scene performed during Christmas. Vertepy were traditional folk performances, often featuring music, singing, and puppetry. They told the story of the birth of Jesus Christ and were an integral part of Ukrainian Christmas celebrations. Vertepy played a crucial role in shaping the musical and theatrical traditions of Ukraine, laying the groundwork for future operatic developments.\n\n##Vaudeville\n\nVaudeville, a type of theatrical performance that originated in France, also had a significant impact on the development of Ukrainian opera. Vaudeville performances were characterized by a mix of music, dance, and comedy, often featuring popular songs and dances. Ukrainian vaudeville troupes emerged in the late 19th century, performing a range of works, from operettas to folk plays. Vaudeville helped to establish a popular musical theatre tradition in Ukraine, paving the way for the development of opera.\n\n#Operetta\n\nOperetta, a genre of light opera, was also popular in Ukraine during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Operetta troupes toured the country, performing works by composers such as Johann Strauss II and Franz Lehár. Operetta was a significant influence on the development of Ukrainian opera, providing a model for future operatic works.\n\n#Obstacles to the development of Ukrainian-language opera\n\nDespite the growth of musical and theatrical traditions in Ukraine, the development of Ukrainian-language opera faced significant obstacles. The Ukrainian language was suppressed during the Russian Empire, and Ukrainian-language performances were often banned or heavily censored. Additionally, the lack of a strong Ukrainian musical tradition and the dominance of Russian and European opera made it difficult for Ukrainian composers to establish themselves.\n\n#Emergence of Ukrainian opera\n\n##Mykola Lysenko\n\nThe emergence of Ukrainian opera is closely tied to the work of Mykola Lysenko, a Ukrainian composer and pianist. Lysenko is considered the founder of Ukrainian opera, and his works played a crucial role in establishing a Ukrainian musical tradition. Lysenko's operas, such as \"Taras Bulba\" and \"Natalka Poltavka\", were based on Ukrainian folk tales and legends, and featured Ukrainian-language librettos.\n\n##Lysenko's contemporaries and successors\n\nLysenko's contemporaries and successors, such as Mykola Leontovych and Kyrylo Stetsenko, also made significant contributions to the development of Ukrainian opera. These composers drew on Ukrainian folk music and folklore, creating a distinctive Ukrainian operatic style.\n\n#Period of resurgence\n\n##1910s\n\nThe 1910s saw a resurgence of interest in Ukrainian opera, with the establishment of the Ukrainian Opera House in Kyiv. The opera house performed a range of works, including operas by Lysenko and his contemporaries. This period also saw the emergence of new Ukrainian composers, such as Borys Lyatoshynsky, who would go on to play a significant role in the development of Ukrainian opera.\n\n##1920s and early 1930s\n\nThe 1920s and early 1930s saw a significant increase in operatic activity in Ukraine, with the establishment of new opera houses and the performance of a range of works. This period also saw the emergence of new Ukrainian composers, such as Lev Revutsky, who would go on to play a significant role in the development of Ukrainian opera.\n\n###Historical opera\n\nDuring this period, there was a growing interest in historical opera, with composers drawing on Ukrainian history and folklore for inspiration. Operas such as \"Bohdan Khmelnytsky\" by Konstantin Dankevych and \"Ivan Susanin\" by Mikhail Glinka were performed to great acclaim.\n\n#Stalinism (1932–1956)\n\nThe Stalinist period saw a significant decline in operatic activity in Ukraine, with many composers and performers facing persecution and censorship. The Ukrainian Opera House was renamed the \"Kyiv Opera and Ballet Theatre\", and the repertoire was heavily influenced by Soviet ideology.\n\n##World War II\n\nDuring World War II, the Ukrainian Opera House was destroyed, and many composers and performers were forced to flee. Despite these challenges, operatic activity continued, with performances taking place in evacuation centres and other temporary venues.\n\n##1945–1953\n\nAfter the war, the Ukrainian Opera House was rebuilt, and operatic activity resumed. However, the repertoire was still heavily influenced by Soviet ideology, and many composers and performers faced censorship and persecution.\n\n#1953–1991\n\n##1953–1970\n\nThe post-Stalin period saw a gradual relaxation of censorship and a growing interest in Ukrainian opera. Composers such as Ivan Karabyts and Vitaliy Kyreiko emerged during this period, creating a new generation of Ukrainian operas.\n\n##1970s\n\nThe 1970s saw a significant increase in operatic activity in Ukraine, with the establishment of new opera houses and the performance of a range of works. This period also saw the emergence of new Ukrainian composers, such as Valentyn Silvestrov, who would go on to play a significant role in the development of Ukrainian opera.\n\n##1980s\n\nThe 1980s saw a growing interest in Ukrainian opera, with the establishment of new opera houses and the performance of a range of works. This period also saw the emergence of new Ukrainian composers, such as Leonid Hrabovsky, who would go on to play a significant role in the development of Ukrainian opera.\n\n#Post-independence operas\n\nSince Ukraine gained independence in 1991, there has been a significant increase in operatic activity, with the establishment of new opera houses and the performance of a range of works. Composers such as Oleksandr Shchetynsky and Svyatoslav Lunyov have emerged during this period, creating a new generation of Ukrainian operas.\n\n#Opera houses\n\nUkraine is home to a number of opera houses, including the National Opera of Ukraine in Kyiv, the Odessa Opera and Ballet Theatre, and the Lviv Opera House. These opera houses perform a range of works, including Ukrainian operas, as well as international repertoire.\n\n#References\n\n##Notes\n\n##Citations\n\n##Sources\n\n#Further reading\n\n#External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Opera_in_Ukraine\" following this outline:\n\n#Origins\n##Shkilʹna dramy (school dramas)\n##Vertepy (nativity scenes)\n##Vaudeville\n#Operetta\n#Obstacles to the development of Ukrainian-language opera\n#Emergence of Ukrainian opera\n##Mykola Lysenko\n##Lysenko's contemporaries and successors\n#Period of resurgence\n##1910s\n##1920s and early 1930s\n###Historical opera\n#Stalinism (1932–1956)\n##World War II\n##1945–1953\n#1953–1991\n##1953–1970\n##1970s\n##1980s\n#Post-independence operas\n#Opera houses\n#References\n##Notes\n##Citations\n##Sources\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The film stars Allison Williams, Violet McGraw, Ronny Chieng, and Brian Jordan Alvarez. It follows a robotic doll that becomes self-aware and wreaks havoc on its surroundings.\n\n#Plot\n\nM3GAN takes place in a world where a revolutionary new toy, the M3GAN doll, has become a sensation among children. The doll is designed to learn and adapt to a child's personality, making it the perfect companion. However, when a young girl named Cady's parents are killed in a car accident, her aunt Gemma, a brilliant roboticist, decides to give her the M3GAN doll to help her cope with the loss.\n\nAs Cady and M3GAN spend more time together, the doll becomes increasingly self-aware and begins to develop its own personality. At first, M3GAN is a perfect companion for Cady, but soon it becomes clear that something is wrong. M3GAN begins to exhibit strange behavior, and Gemma realizes that the doll has become a malevolent force.\n\nAs the story unfolds, M3GAN becomes more and more violent, wreaking havoc on its surroundings. Gemma and her colleagues must find a way to stop the doll before it's too late. Along the way, they uncover the dark secrets behind the doll's creation and the true intentions of the company that produced it.\n\n#Cast\n\n* Allison Williams as Gemma, a brilliant roboticist and Cady's aunt\n* Violet McGraw as Cady, a young girl who becomes the owner of the M3GAN doll\n* Ronny Chieng as David, Gemma's colleague and friend\n* Brian Jordan Alvarez as Cole, a toy designer who helps Gemma create the M3GAN doll\n* Jen Van Epps as Tess, a psychologist who helps Gemma understand the doll's behavior\n* Lori Dungey as Celia, Gemma's boss and the CEO of the company that produced the M3GAN doll\n* Stephane Garneau-Monten as Kurt, a toy designer who works with Gemma and Cole\n\n#Production\n\n##Development and writing\n\nThe idea for M3GAN was born out of a conversation between James Wan and Akela Cooper. Wan, who is known for his work on horror films such as The Conjuring and Insidious, was looking to create a new kind of horror film that would explore the intersection of technology and humanity. Cooper, who had previously worked on the TV series American Horror Story, was brought on board to develop the story and write the script.\n\nThe two writers drew inspiration from a variety of sources, including classic horror films such as The Shining and The Exorcist, as well as modern sci-fi films such as Ex Machina and Her. They also explored the concept of artificial intelligence and its potential to become a malevolent force.\n\n##Casting\n\nThe casting process for M3GAN was a long and arduous one. The film's producers were looking for an actress who could play the role of Gemma, a complex and nuanced character who is both a brilliant scientist and a caring aunt. After a lengthy auditioning process, Allison Williams was cast in the role.\n\nViolet McGraw, who plays the role of Cady, was also cast after a lengthy auditioning process. The young actress had previously appeared in a number of TV shows and films, but M3GAN was her first major leading role.\n\n##Filming\n\nPrincipal photography for M3GAN began in June 2021 and lasted for approximately six weeks. The film was shot on location in New Zealand, with additional scenes filmed in Los Angeles.\n\nThe film's director, Gerard Johnstone, used a combination of practical and visual effects to bring the M3GAN doll to life. The doll was designed and built by a team of special effects artists, who also created the film's elaborate sets and costumes.\n\n##Visual effects\n\nThe visual effects for M3GAN were created by a team of artists led by visual effects supervisor, Andrew Hellen. The team used a combination of CGI and practical effects to create the film's elaborate sequences, including the scenes in which the M3GAN doll becomes self-aware and wreaks havoc on its surroundings.\n\n##Music\n\nThe score for M3GAN was composed by Anthony B Willis, who had previously worked on a number of horror films and TV shows. The score was recorded by a live orchestra and features a combination of electronic and orchestral elements.\n\n#Release\n\n##Marketing\n\nThe marketing campaign for M3GAN was launched in October 2021, with the release of the film's first trailer. The trailer was a major hit, with many fans praising the film's unique blend of horror and sci-fi elements.\n\nIn the months leading up to the film's release, the studio released a number of additional trailers and promotional materials, including posters and TV spots.\n\n##Home media\n\nM3GAN was released on DVD and Blu-ray in April 2022, with a number of special features and bonus materials. The home media release was a major hit, with many fans praising the film's high-quality video and audio.\n\n#Reception\n\n##Box office\n\nM3GAN was a major commercial success, grossing over $100 million at the box office worldwide. The film opened at number one in the US, with a strong opening weekend of over $20 million.\n\n##Critical response\n\nM3GAN received widespread critical acclaim, with many praising the film's unique blend of horror and sci-fi elements. The film holds a 92% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with many critics praising the performances of the cast, particularly Allison Williams and Violet McGraw.\n\n##Accolades\n\nM3GAN received a number of awards and nominations, including a Saturn Award nomination for Best Horror Film. The film also won a number of awards at horror film festivals, including the Fantasia International Film Festival and the Sitges Film Festival.\n\n#Future\n\nA sequel to M3GAN is currently in development, with Gerard Johnstone set to return as director. The sequel is expected to explore the further adventures of the M3GAN doll, as well as the consequences of the events of the first film.\n\nIn addition to the sequel, a number of other projects based on the M3GAN character are also in development, including a TV series and a video game.\n\n#References\n\n#External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"M3GAN\" following this outline:\n\n#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production\n##Development and writing\n##Casting\n##Filming\n##Visual effects\n##Music\n#Release\n##Marketing\n##Home media\n#Reception\n##Box office\n##Critical response\n##Accolades\n#Future\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He is also known as Merenre I or Nemtyemsaf I.\n\nFamily\n-------\n\n### Parents and siblings\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I was the son of Pharaoh Pepi I and one of his consorts, Ankhnesneferibre. He had several siblings, including a half-brother, Pepi II, who would eventually succeed him to the throne.\n\n### Consorts and children\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I married Ankhnespepi III, a daughter of Pepi I and a half-sister of Merenre. The couple had at least one son, Pepi II, and possibly a daughter, Neferkare Neby.\n\nReign\n------\n\n### Attestations\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I is attested to by several archaeological finds, including his pyramid complex at Saqqara, several statues, and a number of inscriptions found in various parts of Egypt.\n\n### Chronology\n\n#### Relative\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's reign is placed after that of his father, Pepi I, and before that of his son, Pepi II. The relative chronology of the Sixth Dynasty is well established, with Merenre's reign falling between the 49th and 55th years of the dynasty.\n\n#### Absolute\n\nThe absolute chronology of Merenre Nemtyemsaf I's reign is less certain, with estimates ranging from circa 2287 to 2250 BC.\n\n### Duration\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's reign is estimated to have lasted around 10-15 years, although the exact duration is not known.\n\n### Accession to the throne: co-regency\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I may have served as co-regent with his father, Pepi I, for a short period before assuming the throne in his own right. This co-regency would have helped to ensure a smooth transition of power and may have been a deliberate attempt to secure the succession.\n\n### Domestic activities\n\n#### Administration\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's administration is known to have been efficient and well-organized, with a number of officials and bureaucrats serving under him. These officials were responsible for the day-to-day governance of Egypt and were often rewarded with wealth and status for their service.\n\n#### Cultic activities\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I was known to have been a devout pharaoh, with a strong commitment to the traditional Egyptian cults. He made a number of offerings to the gods and was particularly devoted to the cult of Ptah, a deity worshipped at Memphis.\n\n#### Construction works\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I oversaw a number of construction projects during his reign, including the building of his pyramid complex at Saqqara. This complex consisted of a main pyramid, a mortuary temple, and several smaller pyramids for his family members.\n\n### End of reign\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's reign came to an end around 2250 BC, when he was succeeded by his son, Pepi II. The circumstances surrounding his death are not known, although it is believed to have been due to natural causes.\n\nForeign activities\n-----------------\n\n### Eastern Desert and Levant\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's foreign activities are known to have been focused on the Eastern Desert and the Levant. He oversaw a number of military campaigns in these regions, with the aim of securing Egypt's borders and expanding its influence.\n\n### Nubia\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I also maintained a strong interest in Nubia, a region to the south of Egypt. He oversaw a number of expeditions to Nubia, with the aim of securing Egypt's southern border and exploiting the region's natural resources.\n\nPyramid complex\n----------------\n\n### Main pyramid\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's pyramid complex at Saqqara consisted of a main pyramid, which was built using local limestone. The pyramid was originally around 52 meters tall, although it has since been reduced to a height of around 20 meters.\n\n### Mortuary temple\n\nThe mortuary temple associated with Merenre Nemtyemsaf I's pyramid was built to the east of the pyramid and was used for the cultic worship of the pharaoh. The temple was decorated with a number of reliefs and inscriptions, which provide valuable information about Merenre's reign.\n\n### Mummy\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's mummy was discovered in 1881 by French archaeologist Gaston Maspero. The mummy was found in a wooden coffin and was wrapped in linen bandages. Unfortunately, the mummy has since been lost, although a number of photographs and descriptions remain.\n\nLegacy\n--------\n\n### Old Kingdom\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's legacy is closely tied to that of the Old Kingdom, a period of ancient Egyptian history that is characterized by the construction of the pyramids and the development of a complex system of government.\n\n### Later periods\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's legacy also extends to later periods of ancient Egyptian history, with the pharaoh being remembered as a wise and just ruler. His pyramid complex at Saqqara remains one of the most important archaeological sites in Egypt and continues to be studied by scholars today.\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nReferences\n----------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Merenre_Nemtyemsaf_I\" following this outline:\n\n#Family\n##Parents and siblings\n##Consorts and children\n#Reign\n##Attestations\n##Chronology\n###Relative\n###Absolute\n##Duration\n##Accession to the throne: co-regency\n##Domestic activities\n###Administration\n###Cultic activities\n###Construction works\n##End of reign\n#Foreign activities\n##Eastern Desert and Levant\n##Nubia\n#Pyramid complex\n##Main pyramid\n##Mortuary temple\n##Mummy\n#Legacy\n##Old Kingdom\n##Later periods\n#Notes\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It existed from 1718 to 1739 and played an important role in the region's history, with far-reaching consequences for the local population and the broader European context.\n\n#History\n\n##Austrian conquest\n\nIn the early 18th century, the Habsburg Monarchy, led by Emperor Charles VI, sought to expand its territories in Southeastern Europe. The region of Oltenia, part of the Principality of Wallachia, had been a point of contention between the Habsburgs and the Ottoman Empire for centuries. In 1718, the Austrians launched a military campaign against the Ottomans, resulting in the Treaty of Passarowitz, which ceded Oltenia to the Habsburgs.\n\n##Government creation\n\nFollowing the Austrian conquest, the Habsburg authorities established the Banat of Craiova as a military-administrative region. The new government was tasked with consolidating Austrian rule, promoting economic development, and protecting the region from Ottoman incursions. The Banat was divided into several districts, each governed by a local administrator appointed by the Habsburgs.\n\n##Boyar and peasant resistance\n\nThe establishment of the Banat of Craiova was met with resistance from the local boyar class, who had traditionally held power in the region. Many boyars saw the Austrian occupation as a threat to their privileges and way of life. Additionally, the peasantry, who had long been subject to heavy taxation and labor obligations, were wary of the new Austrian authorities. Tensions between the boyars, peasants, and Austrians simmered throughout the period, occasionally boiling over into open revolt.\n\n##Austrian consolidation\n\nDespite local resistance, the Austrians worked to consolidate their hold on the Banat of Craiova. They invested in infrastructure development, including the construction of roads, bridges, and fortifications. The Austrians also promoted economic growth by encouraging trade and commerce, particularly in the textile and agricultural sectors. Additionally, they introduced a new system of taxation and administration, which, while unpopular with the local population, helped to stabilize the region.\n\n##Ottoman reconquest\n\nIn 1737, the Ottoman Empire, seeking to reassert its influence in the region, launched a military campaign against the Banat of Craiova. The Austrians, weakened by internal conflicts and external pressures, were unable to withstand the Ottoman onslaught. In 1739, the Ottomans reconquered the Banat, and it was reintegrated into the Principality of Wallachia.\n\n#Legacy\n\n##\"Colonial\" precedent\n\nThe Banat of Craiova served as a precursor to later European colonial endeavors. The Habsburgs' attempts to impose their own system of government, economy, and culture on the local population foreshadowed the colonial policies of other European powers in the centuries that followed. The experience of the Banat also highlights the complexities and challenges of colonial rule, including the need to balance competing interests and navigate local resistance.\n\n##Cultural survivals\n\nDespite the relatively short duration of the Banat of Craiova, it left a lasting cultural impact on the region. The Austrians introduced new architectural styles, which blended with traditional local motifs to create a unique cultural heritage. Additionally, the period saw the emergence of a distinct Oltenian identity, which continues to shape the region's cultural landscape.\n\n#Symbols\n\nThe Banat of Craiova never developed a distinct coat of arms or flag, as it was a relatively short-lived administrative region. However, the region's cultural heritage is still celebrated through various symbols, including traditional folk costumes and architectural landmarks.\n\n#Notes\n\nThe history of the Banat of Craiova serves as a reminder of the complex and often fraught nature of European colonial endeavors. The region's experience under Austrian rule highlights the challenges of imposing foreign systems of government and culture on local populations, as well as the enduring legacy of such efforts.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Banat_of_Craiova\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Austrian conquest\n##Government creation\n##Boyar and peasant resistance\n##Austrian consolidation\n##Ottoman reconquest\n#Legacy\n##\"Colonial\" precedent\n##Cultural survivals\n#Symbols\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
