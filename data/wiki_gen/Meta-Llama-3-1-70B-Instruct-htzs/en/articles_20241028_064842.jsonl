Farland was a renowned American banjo player, composer, and music educator of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He was a prominent figure in the development of classical banjo music and was known for his innovative approach to the instrument. Farland's contributions to the world of music are still celebrated today, and his legacy continues to inspire banjo enthusiasts and classical music aficionados alike.\n\n# Background\n\nAlfred A. Farland was born in 1864 in the United States. Little is known about his early life, but it is believed that he began playing the banjo at a young age. Farland's early musical influences were likely shaped by the popular music of the time, including minstrel shows and folk music. As he honed his skills, he became increasingly interested in classical music and its potential application to the banjo.\n\n# Professional life\n\nFarland's professional career as a musician began in the late 1880s, during which time he worked as a banjo soloist and accompanist. He performed with various musical ensembles, including orchestras and chamber groups, and quickly gained recognition for his technical skill and musicality. Farland's playing style was characterized by his use of classical techniques, such as fingerpicking and arpeggios, which set him apart from other banjo players of the time.\n\n# Classical-music artist\n\nFarland's passion for classical music led him to become one of the first banjo players to specialize in classical repertoire. He transcribed and arranged numerous classical pieces for the banjo, including works by composers such as Bach, Mozart, and Chopin. Farland's arrangements were highly regarded for their technical difficulty and musicality, and he became known as a leading exponent of classical banjo music.\n\n# Marketing with his name\n\nFarland was also a shrewd businessman, and he recognized the value of his name as a marketing tool. He began to use his name as a brand, applying it to a range of banjo-related products, including banjos, strings, and instructional materials. Farland's marketing efforts helped to establish him as a household name among banjo enthusiasts, and his products became highly sought after.\n\n# American Banjo Fraternity\n\nIn 1900, Farland co-founded the American Banjo Fraternity, an organization dedicated to promoting the banjo and its music. The fraternity aimed to raise the profile of the banjo as a serious musical instrument and to provide a platform for banjo players to share their music and ideas. Farland served as the fraternity's first president and played a key role in shaping its activities and policies.\n\n# Works\n\nFarland was a prolific composer and arranger, and his works include a wide range of pieces for solo banjo and banjo ensemble. His music is characterized by its technical difficulty, musicality, and innovative use of banjo techniques.\n\n## Educational\n\nFarland was also a dedicated music educator, and he wrote several instructional books and methods for the banjo. His most famous work, \"The Farland Banjo Method,\" is still used today by banjo students and teachers around the world. The method provides a comprehensive introduction to banjo playing, covering topics such as technique, music theory, and performance practice.\n\n## Sheet music\n\nFarland published numerous pieces of sheet music for the banjo, including solos, duets, and ensemble works. His music was highly regarded for its technical difficulty and musicality, and it remains popular among banjo players today. Many of Farland's compositions and arrangements are still in print, and they can be found in music stores and online.\n\n# Gallery\n\nA gallery of images related to Alfred A.

They were a significant force in the Mediterranean world during the Roman Republic period and played a crucial role in shaping the region's history, culture, and politics.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe term \"Samnite\" is derived from the Latin word \"Samnites,\" which is itself derived from the Oscan word \"Safinim,\" meaning \"those from Safinum.\" Safinum was the name of a city in Samnium, and the term eventually came to refer to the entire ethnic group.\n\n**History**\n\n### Origins and early history\n\nThe origins of the Samnites are shrouded in mystery, but it is believed that they were an Indo-European-speaking people who migrated to Italy from the north in the 6th century BC. They settled in the Apennine Mountains, where they developed a distinct culture and identity. The Samnites were a rural, agricultural people who lived in small villages and towns, and their early history was marked by constant conflict with their neighbors, including the Etruscans and the Latins.\n\n### Samnite Wars\n\nThe Samnite Wars were a series of conflicts between the Samnites and the Romans that lasted from 343 to 290 BC. The wars were sparked by Roman expansion into Samnite territory, and they resulted in the eventual defeat of the Samnites and the incorporation of their territory into the Roman Republic. The Samnite Wars were significant because they marked the beginning of Roman expansion in Italy and the development of the Roman army into a powerful and disciplined fighting force.\n\n### Later history\n\nAfter their defeat in the Samnite Wars, the Samnites continued to play an important role in Italian politics and culture. Many Samnites were integrated into the Roman Republic, and they served as soldiers, administrators, and politicians. The Samnites also maintained their own distinct culture and identity, and they continued to practice their own language, customs, and traditions. In the 1st century BC, the Samnites joined the Social War, a rebellion against Roman rule, but they were ultimately defeated and their territory was incorporated into the Roman Empire.\n\n**Society**\n\n### Economy\n\nThe Samnite economy was based on agriculture, and the Samnites were skilled farmers who grew crops such as wheat, barley, and grapes. They also raised livestock, including cattle, pigs, and sheep. The Samnites were known for their high-quality wool, which was highly prized by the Romans.

Each Samnite tribe had its own council of elders, which made decisions on behalf of the tribe.

The Samnites were known for their democratic system of government, which allowed for the participation of all citizens in the decision-making process.\n\n### Military\n\nThe Samnite military was a powerful and disciplined fighting force. The Samnites were known for their skill in hand-to-hand combat, and they used a variety of tactics, including ambushes and guerrilla warfare. The Samnite military was also known for its use of armor and weaponry, which was of high quality and often decorated with intricate designs.\n\n#### Armor\n\nThe Samnites used a variety of armor, including helmets, breastplates, and greaves. Their armor was often decorated with intricate designs and symbols, which were used to identify the wearer's tribe and status. The Samnites also used shields, which were made of wood or metal and were often decorated with feathers and other ornaments.\n\n#### Weaponry\n\nThe Samnites used a variety of weapons, including swords, spears, and javelins. Their swords were often decorated with intricate designs and were used for both battle and ceremonial purposes. The Samnites also used bows and arrows, which were used for hunting and warfare.\n\n**Culture**\n\n### Religion\n\nThe Samnite religion was a complex system of beliefs and practices that were centered on the worship of a variety of gods and goddesses. The Samnites believed in a number of deities, including Jupiter, Mars, and Venus, and they built temples and shrines to honor these gods. The Samnites also practiced animal sacrifice and divination, and they believed in the importance of omens and auguries.\n\n### Gender roles\n\nThe Samnites had a complex system of gender roles, which varied depending on the tribe and the individual. In general, women played an important role in Samnite society, and they were allowed to own property and participate in the decision-making process. However, women were also expected to fulfill traditional roles, such as managing the household and raising children.\n\n### Art\n\nThe Samnites were skilled artists, and they produced a variety of art forms, including pottery, sculpture, and metalwork.

The search was part of an investigation into the handling of presidential records, including classified documents, and the potential violation of federal laws.\n\n# Background\n\n## Handling, storage, and disposition of U.S. government records\n\nThe handling, storage, and disposition of U.S. government records are governed by federal laws and regulations. The Presidential Records Act of 1978 requires the President to preserve and maintain records of their administration, and to transfer them to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) at the end of their term. The Federal Records Act of 1950 requires federal agencies to maintain and preserve records, and to follow proper procedures for their disposal.\n\n### Criminal laws listed on search warrant\n\nThe search warrant executed at Mar-a-Lago listed several federal statutes, including 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 793 (gathering, transmitting, or losing defense information), 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 2071 (concealment, removal, or mutilation of documents), and 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 1519 (destruction, alteration, or falsification of records in federal investigations).\n\n### Classified material and the presidency\n\nThe handling of classified material is a critical aspect of national security. The President has the authority to classify and declassify information, but this authority is subject to regulations and guidelines.\n\n#### Declassification, presidential powers and regulations\n\nThe President's power to declassify information is derived from Executive Order 13526, which governs the classification and declassification of national security information.

The fort played a significant role in the early history of New York City and was a key location in the colonial era.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### Establishment (1621‚Äì1660)\n\nIn 1621, the Dutch West India Company granted a charter to the New Netherland Company to establish a settlement on Manhattan Island. The company's director, Willem Verhulst, arrived on the island in 1624 and began construction of a fort, which was named Fort Amsterdam. The fort was built to protect the Dutch colony from potential threats from the English and Native American tribes.\n\nThe fort was constructed using local materials, including wood and stone, and was designed to be a simple, yet effective, defensive structure. It was surrounded by a palisade, a wooden fence, and had several bastions, or strongpoints, to provide additional protection.\n\nOver the years, the fort was expanded and improved, with the addition of new buildings, including a church, a governor's house, and a number of private residences. The fort became the center of the Dutch colony, and its strategic location allowed it to control access to the Hudson River and the surrounding area.\n\n### English rule (1664‚Äì1673)\n\nIn 1664, the English sent a fleet to New Amsterdam, and the Dutch colony was surrendered without a fight. The English renamed the colony New York, after the Duke of York, who had been granted a charter to the colony by his brother, King Charles II.\n\nDuring the English period, Fort Amsterdam was used as a military base and was occupied by English soldiers. The fort was also used as a place of imprisonment for those who opposed English rule, including several prominent Dutch colonists.\n\n### Dutch rule (1673‚Äì1674)\n\nIn 1673, the Dutch recaptured New York and Fort Amsterdam was once again under Dutch control. However, the Dutch period was short-lived, and in 1674, the English regained control of the colony.\n\n### English rule (1674‚Äì1689)\n\nDuring the second English period, Fort Amsterdam was once again used as a military base and was occupied by English soldiers. The fort was also used as a place of imprisonment for those who opposed English rule, including several prominent Dutch colonists.\n\nIn 1689, a group of colonists, who were dissatisfied with English rule, seized control of Fort Amsterdam and declared their independence from England. This event marked the beginning of a period of colonist rule in New York.\n\n### Colonist rule (1689‚Äì1691)\n\nDuring the period of colonist rule, Fort Amsterdam was used as a seat of government and was occupied by the colonists. The fort was also used as a place of imprisonment for those who opposed colonist rule.\n\nIn 1691, the English regained control of New York and Fort Amsterdam was once again under English control.\n\n### British rule (1691‚Äì1775)\n\nDuring the British period, Fort Amsterdam was used as a military base and was occupied by British soldiers. The fort was also used as a place of imprisonment for those who opposed British rule.\n\nIn the years leading up to the American Revolution, tensions between the British and the colonists continued to rise. The British imposed a number of taxes on the colonists, including the Stamp Act and the Townshend Acts, which were deeply unpopular.\n\n### Prelude to the revolution\n\nIn 1774, a group of colonists, who were dissatisfied with British rule, formed the Sons of Liberty, a radical group that was dedicated to resisting British rule. The Sons of Liberty were responsible for a number of protests and demonstrations, including the Boston Tea Party, which was a major event in the lead-up to the American Revolution.\n\n### Colonist rule (1775‚Äì1776)\n\nIn 1775, the American Revolution began, and the colonists seized control of Fort Amsterdam. The fort was used as a military base and was occupied by colonial soldiers.\n\nIn 1776, the Declaration of Independence was signed, and the United States of America was officially established.\n\n### British rule (1776‚Äì1783)\n\nDespite the Declaration of Independence, the British continued to occupy New York and Fort Amsterdam. The fort was used as a military base and was occupied by British soldiers.\n\nIn 1783, the Treaty of Paris was signed, which officially ended the American Revolution and recognized American independence. The British withdrew from New York and Fort Amsterdam, and the fort was abandoned.\n\n### American rule (1783‚Äì1790)\n\nAfter the British withdrew, Fort Amsterdam was abandoned and fell into disrepair. In 1790, the fort was demolished, and the site was used for other purposes.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* New Amsterdam\n* Dutch West India Company\n* American Revolution\n* British rule in the Thirteen Colonies\n\nNotes\n-----\n\n* This article is based on a number of sources, including historical texts and academic articles.\n\nCitations\n----------\n\n* None\n\nBibliography\n------------\n\nFurther reading\n---------------\n\n* Burrows, Edwin G., and Mike Wallace.

The election was the fifth to be held in less than four years, following the 2019 and 2020 elections, which failed to produce a stable government, and the 2021 election, which resulted in a short-lived government.\n\n#Background\n\nThe 2022 Israeli legislative election was necessitated by the collapse of the 36th government of Israel, led by Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, in June 2022. The government, which was formed in June 2021 after the 2021 election, was a coalition of eight parties with diverse ideologies, ranging from the right-wing Yamina to the left-wing Meretz. The coalition was plagued by internal divisions and disagreements, particularly over issues related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the role of religion in the state.\n\nIn June 2022, the government lost its majority in the Knesset after a member of the coalition, Ghaida Rinawie Zoabi, resigned from the coalition and joined the opposition. The opposition, led by the Likud party, subsequently passed a no-confidence motion, dissolving the government and triggering new elections.\n\n#Campaign\n\nThe campaign for the 2022 Israeli legislative election began in earnest in July 2022, with the announcement of the election date. The campaign was marked by a series of debates and television appearances by the leaders of the major parties, as well as a significant amount of social media activity.\n\nThe campaign focused on a number of key issues, including the economy, security, and the role of religion in the state. The Likud party, led by former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, campaigned on a platform of economic growth and security, while the center-left parties, including the Labor party and Meretz, focused on issues related to social justice and the environment.\n\nThe far-right parties, including the Religious Zionist party and the Otzma Yehudit party, campaigned on a platform of nationalism and security, while the Arab parties, including the United Arab List and the Hadash party, focused on issues related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the rights of Arab citizens of Israel.\n\n#Timeline\n\n* June 29, 2022: The 36th government of Israel collapses after losing its majority in the Knesset.\n* July 10, 2022: The Knesset votes to dissolve itself, triggering new elections.\n* July 14, 2022: The Central Elections Committee sets the election date for November 1, 2022.\n* August 15, 2022: The deadline for parties to submit their lists of candidates.\n* October 25, 2022: The start of the election campaign on television and radio.\n* November 1, 2022: Election day.\n\n#Electoral System\n\nIsrael uses a proportional representation electoral system, in which seats in the Knesset are allocated to parties based on the number of votes they receive. The country is a single constituency, with all citizens voting in the same election.\n\n##Surplus-Vote Agreements\n\nIn the Israeli electoral system, surplus votes are votes cast for a party that are not needed to elect a candidate. These votes can be transferred to other parties through surplus-vote agreements, which are agreements between two or more parties to transfer surplus votes to each other.\n\nIn the 2022 election, a number of parties signed surplus-vote agreements, including the Likud party and the Religious Zionist party.\n\n#Political Parties\n\n##Factions Before the Election\n\nBefore the election, the Knesset was composed of 13 factions, representing a range of ideologies and interests. The largest faction was the Likud party, with 29 seats, followed by the Blue and White party, with 17 seats.\n\n##Retiring Incumbents\n\nA number of incumbent members of the Knesset announced their retirement before the election, including the Speaker of the Knesset, Mickey Levy.\n\n##Contesting Parties\n\nA total of 40 parties contested the 2022 Israeli legislative election, including a number of new parties.

The controversy centers around a gathering at a Labour Party office in Durham, England, on April 30, 2021, during which food and beer were reportedly consumed.\n\nDurham Event\n-------------\n\nOn April 30, 2021, Keir Starmer and Angela Rayner attended a gathering at the Labour Party's office in Durham, which was also the constituency office of Labour MP Mary Foy. The event was initially described as a work meeting, with Starmer and Rayner reportedly working on the local election campaign. However, it was later alleged that the gathering involved food and beer, which was not permitted under the COVID-19 lockdown rules in place at the time.\n\nVideo Footage\n-------------\n\nIn January 2022, video footage emerged showing Keir Starmer and Angela Rayner drinking beer and eating food at the Durham office. The footage was obtained by the Daily Mail and appeared to contradict the initial characterization of the event as a work meeting.\n\nResponse to Partygate\n-------------------\n\nThe Beergate controversy emerged in the context of the Partygate scandal, which involved allegations of COVID-19 rule-breaking by government officials, including Prime Minister Boris Johnson. The Labour Party had been critical of the government's handling of the pandemic and had called for Johnson's resignation over the Partygate scandal.\n\nInitial Police Review\n--------------------\n\nIn January 2022, Durham Constabulary announced that it would review the circumstances surrounding the Durham event to determine whether any COVID-19 rules had been broken. The review was described as a \"fact-finding exercise\" to establish the facts of the case.\n\n### Calls for Further Investigation\n\nFollowing the initial review, some Conservative politicians called for a full police investigation into the Durham event, citing concerns that the Labour Party had not been truthful about the nature of the gathering.\n\nPolice Investigation\n-------------------\n\nIn May 2022, Durham Constabulary announced that it would conduct a formal investigation into the Durham event, following a complaint from a member of the public.\n\n### Start of Investigation\n\nThe investigation began in early May 2022, with police officers speaking to witnesses and gathering evidence.\n\n### New Allegations\n\nDuring the investigation, new allegations emerged that the Durham event had involved a larger number of people than initially reported, and that food and drink had been served throughout the evening.\n\n### Starmer's and Rayner's Resignation Pledges\n\nIn response to the allegations, Keir Starmer and Angela Rayner announced that they would resign as Labour leader and deputy leader if they were found to have broken COVID-19 rules. The pledges were seen as an attempt to demonstrate the Labour Party's commitment to accountability and transparency.\n\n### Responses to Pledges\n\nThe Conservative Party responded to the pledges by calling for Starmer and Rayner to resign immediately, citing concerns that they had lied about the nature of the Durham event.\n\n### Police Questionnaires\n\nAs part of the investigation, police officers distributed questionnaires to attendees at the Durham event, seeking information about their activities on the evening of April 30, 2021.\n\n### Outcome\n\nOn July 8, 2022, Durham Constabulary announced that it had concluded its investigation into the Durham event and had found no evidence of COVID-19 rule-breaking. The investigation found that the gathering had been a legitimate work meeting, and that food and drink had been served in a way that was consistent with the COVID-19 rules in place at the time.\n\n### Responses to the Outcome\n\nThe Labour Party welcomed the outcome of the investigation, with Keir Starmer and Angela Rayner stating that they had been vindicated by the findings. The Conservative Party responded by criticizing the investigation, citing concerns that it had been inadequate and that the Labour Party had not been held to account for its actions.\n\nRelated Developments\n-------------------\n\nThe Beergate controversy has had several related developments, including:\n\n* The Partygate scandal, which involved allegations of COVID-19 rule-breaking by government officials, including Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\n* The resignation of Conservative MP Neil Parish, who was found to have broken COVID-19 rules by attending a party in Parliament.\n* The establishment of a parliamentary inquiry into the government's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSee Also\n--------\n\n* COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom\n* Partygate scandal\n* Keir Starmer\n* Angela Rayner\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nThis article is based on publicly available information and does not include any citations or references.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nNone.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Beergate\" following this outline:\n\n#Durham event\n##Video footage\n#Response to Partygate\n#Initial police review\n##Calls for further investigation\n#Police investigation\n##Start of investigation\n##New allegations\n##Starmer's and Rayner's resignation pledges\n##Responses to pledges\n##Police questionnaires\n##Outcome\n##Responses to the outcome\n#Related developments\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The battle took place in and around the city of Sievierodonetsk, which is the administrative center of the Sievierodonetsk Raion in the Luhansk Oblast of eastern Ukraine.\n\n# Background\n\nSievierodonetsk is a strategically important city located near the border with Russia and has been a key stronghold for Ukrainian forces in the region. Prior to the 2022 invasion, the city had a population of around 105,000 people and was a major industrial and economic center in eastern Ukraine. The city's location made it a crucial point for controlling the surrounding region, and its capture would provide a significant advantage to the side that controls it.\n\nIn the months leading up to the invasion, there were reports of a significant buildup of Russian troops and military equipment near the Ukrainian border. On February 24, 2022, Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine, with troops advancing on multiple fronts. The Ukrainian military responded quickly, and fierce fighting broke out across the country.\n\n# Battle\n\n## Encirclement attempts\n\nIn the early stages of the battle, Russian-backed separatists and Russian troops attempted to encircle Sievierodonetsk, cutting off supply lines and escape routes for Ukrainian forces. However, Ukrainian troops managed to hold their ground, and the city remained under their control. The Ukrainians also launched counterattacks, pushing back against the Russian advance and retaking some lost territory.\n\n## Attack on the city\n\nDespite the initial failure to encircle the city, Russian troops continued to push forward, launching a series of attacks on Sievierodonetsk. The city came under heavy artillery and rocket fire, causing significant damage to buildings and infrastructure. Ukrainian forces responded with their own artillery and missile strikes, targeting Russian positions and supply lines.\n\n## Ukraine rejects surrender ultimatum\n\nOn June 15, 2022, Russian forces issued an ultimatum to Ukrainian troops in Sievierodonetsk, demanding that they surrender and lay down their arms. However, the Ukrainians rejected the ultimatum, vowing to continue fighting for control of the city. The Ukrainian government stated that it would not negotiate with Russia while the country was under attack.\n\n## Fall of Sievierodonetsk\n\nAfter weeks of intense fighting, Russian troops finally breached the defenses of Sievierodonetsk on June 25, 2022. Ukrainian forces retreated from the city, and Russian troops took control of the remaining territory. The fall of Sievierodonetsk marked a significant turning point in the battle, as Russian forces had now gained control of a major urban center in eastern Ukraine.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe capture of Sievierodonetsk gave Russian forces a significant advantage in the region, allowing them to launch further attacks on Ukrainian-held territory. The Ukrainian government vowed to retake the city, but it remains under Russian control to this day.\n\nThe battle also had significant humanitarian consequences, with thousands of civilians displaced or forced to flee their homes. The city suffered significant damage, with many buildings and infrastructure destroyed or damaged.\n\n# Casualties\n\nEstimates of casualties during the battle vary widely, with both sides suffering significant losses. Ukrainian officials reported that hundreds of Russian troops were killed or injured, while Russian officials claimed that Ukrainian forces suffered heavy casualties.\n\n# Analysis\n\nThe Battle of Sievierodonetsk was a significant turning point in the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, marking a major shift in momentum in favor of Russian forces. The capture of the city gave Russian troops a strategic advantage in the region, allowing them to launch further attacks on Ukrainian-held territory.\n\nThe battle also highlighted the significant challenges facing Ukrainian forces, who have been fighting a well-equipped and well-trained enemy. Despite being outgunned and outmanned, Ukrainian troops managed to hold their ground for weeks, inflicting significant casualties on Russian forces.\n\n# See also\n\n* 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* War in Donbas\n* Luhansk Oblast\n* Sievierodonetsk", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Battle_of_Sievierodonetsk_(2022)\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Battle\n##Encirclement attempts\n##Attack on the city\n##Ukraine rejects surrender ultimatum\n##Fall of Sievierodonetsk\n#Aftermath\n#Casualties\n#Analysis\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The disaster was one of the deadliest earthquakes to hit the country in recent years, and it drew international attention and aid.\n\n# Earthquake\n\n## Tectonic setting\n\nThe June 2022 Afghanistan earthquake occurred in a region of high seismic activity. Afghanistan is located in the Himalayan seismic zone, where the Indian tectonic plate is colliding with the Eurasian plate. This collision has resulted in the formation of several major fault lines, including the Chaman Fault, which runs along the border with Pakistan. The region is also home to several other significant fault lines, including the Kabul Fault and the Herat Fault.\n\n## Characteristics\n\nThe earthquake had a magnitude of 5.9 on the Richter scale and a depth of approximately 10 kilometers (6.2 miles). It was a shallow earthquake, with its epicenter located in the Paktika Province of Afghanistan. The earthquake was of a thrust type, meaning that the ground on one side of the fault was pushed up relative to the ground on the other side.\n\n## Intensity\n\nThe intensity of the earthquake was significant, with reports of widespread destruction and damage to buildings and infrastructure. The earthquake was felt as far away as Islamabad, Pakistan, and New Delhi, India.\n\n## Aftershocks\n\nSeveral aftershocks were reported in the hours and days following the earthquake, with magnitudes ranging from 3.0 to 4.0. These aftershocks caused additional damage and anxiety for those affected by the initial earthquake.\n\n# Impact\n\n## Afghanistan\n\nThe earthquake had a devastating impact on Afghanistan, particularly in the southeastern provinces of Paktika and Khost. Reports indicated that thousands of homes were destroyed or damaged, leaving many families without access to basic necessities like shelter, food, and water. The earthquake also damaged critical infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and hospitals.\n\nThe Afghan government reported that over 1,000 people were killed in the earthquake, with many more injured. The true extent of the damage and loss of life may never be known, as many areas of the country are remote and inaccessible.\n\n## Pakistan\n\nThe earthquake was also felt in Pakistan, particularly in the northwestern provinces of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab. Reports indicated that several buildings were damaged, and a few people were injured. However, the impact on Pakistan was relatively minor compared to Afghanistan.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe aftermath of the earthquake was marked by widespread devastation and a massive humanitarian response. Rescue teams and aid workers from around the world rushed to the affected areas to provide assistance.\n\n# Domestic response\n\nThe Afghan government responded quickly to the disaster, with President Ashraf Ghani declaring a state of emergency and deploying troops to assist with the relief efforts. The government also appealed for international aid to support the affected populations.\n\n# International response\n\n## United States\n\nThe United States was among the first countries to respond to the disaster, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken announcing a $55 million aid package to support the Afghan people. The US also deployed a team of disaster response experts to assist with the relief efforts.\n\n## International organizations\n\nSeveral international organizations, including the United Nations, the Red Cross, and the European Union, also responded to the disaster with aid and assistance. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported that over $100 million in aid had been pledged to support the affected populations.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of earthquakes in 2022\n* List of earthquakes in Afghanistan\n* Afghanistan‚ÄìPakistan relations\n\n# References\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)\n\n# Further reading\n\n* \"Afghanistan earthquake: At least 1,000 people killed in Paktika province\".

Fury of the Gods\n\nShazam! Fury of the Gods is a 2023 American superhero film directed by David F. Sandberg and written by Henry Gayden and Chris Morgan.

The gods, led by the goddess Hespera (Helen Mirren), decide to take away Shazam's powers and destroy the world.\n\nMeanwhile, Billy's friends and family are struggling to cope with their own personal issues. Mary Bromfield (Grace Fulton) is trying to balance her superhero life with her college life, while Freddy Freeman (Jack Dylan Grazer) is trying to find his place in the world. The family soon discovers that the gods are planning to destroy the world and that they must work together to stop them.\n\nAs the gods launch their attack on the world, Shazam and his family must use all their skills and powers to defend the earth.

Little is known about his early life, but it is reported that he had a difficult childhood and was involved in petty crimes from a young age. Cavalcante's family has not spoken publicly about his early life or his alleged crimes.\n\n#Alleged 2017 murder of Valter J√∫nior Moreira dos Reis\n\nIn 2017, Cavalcante was accused of murdering Valter J√∫nior Moreira dos Reis, a Brazilian businessman. The murder allegedly took place in the state of S√£o Paulo, where Cavalcante was living at the time. According to reports, Cavalcante and Reis had a dispute over a business deal gone sour, which led to the fatal shooting. Cavalcante denied any involvement in the crime, but evidence pointed to his guilt.\n\n#Escape to the United States\n\nFollowing the alleged murder, Cavalcante fled Brazil and entered the United States as an undocumented immigrant. He settled in the state of Florida, where he assumed a new identity and began working odd jobs to support himself. Cavalcante managed to evade law enforcement for several years, during which time he became increasingly embroiled in a life of crime.\n\n#2021 murder of Deborah Brand√£o\n\nIn 2021, Cavalcante was accused of murdering Deborah Brand√£o, a 19-year-old Brazilian woman who had recently moved to the United States. The murder took place in the state of Florida, where Cavalcante had been living for several years. According to reports, Cavalcante and Brand√£o had a romantic relationship, but it ended violently when Cavalcante allegedly strangled her to death. Cavalcante was arrested and charged with the crime, but he managed to escape from custody before his trial.\n\n#2023 prison escape\n\nIn 2023, Cavalcante escaped from a maximum-security prison in Florida, where he was being held on charges related to the murder of Deborah Brand√£o. The escape was highly publicized, with authorities launching a massive manhunt to capture the fugitive.\n\n##Manhunt\n\nThe manhunt for Cavalcante was one of the largest in recent history, with law enforcement agencies across the United States working together to track him down. Authorities released a composite sketch of Cavalcante and warned the public to be on the lookout for a man with a history of violence. The manhunt lasted for several weeks, during which time Cavalcante managed to evade capture.\n\n##Capture\n\nCavalcante was eventually captured in a remote area of the Florida wilderness, where he had been hiding for several weeks. The capture was made possible by a tip from a member of the public, who had spotted Cavalcante in the area. Authorities surrounded the area and apprehended Cavalcante without incident.\n\n##Aftermath\n\nFollowing his capture, Cavalcante was returned to custody and charged with multiple counts of murder and escape. The case against him is ongoing, with prosecutors seeking the death penalty for his alleged crimes. Cavalcante's capture brought closure to the families of his alleged victims, who had been waiting for justice for years.\n\n#Notes\n\nDanilo Cavalcante's case has sparked widespread debate about the need for stricter immigration laws and improved law enforcement cooperation between countries.

This article provides an overview of the book's key aspects, exploring its background and literary references, form and content, and reception.\n\n#Overview\n\nIJP_The_Book_of_Surfaces is a book that resists summary, instead inviting readers to immerse themselves in its intricate web of language, imagery, and ideas. At its core, the book is an exploration of the nature of reality, perception, and the human experience. Through a series of fragmented narratives, lyrical passages, and visual experiments, the book's author(s) challenge readers to reconsider their relationship with the world around them.\n\n#Background and literary references\n\nIJP_The_Book_of_Surfaces draws upon a diverse range of literary and philosophical influences, from the modernist experiments of James Joyce and Virginia Woolf to the poststructuralist theories of Jacques Derrida and Gilles Deleuze. The book's use of fragmented narratives and multiple narrative voices owes a debt to the innovations of modernist fiction, while its emphasis on the materiality of language and the instability of meaning reflects the influence of poststructuralist thought.\n\n##Influence of modernist literature\n\nThe book's modernist heritage is evident in its use of non-linear narrative structures and its emphasis on the subjective experience of the individual. Like Joyce's Ulysses or Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway, IJP_The_Book_of_Surfaces seeks to capture the fluid, unstructured nature of human consciousness, presenting the reader with a kaleidoscopic array of images, thoughts, and emotions.\n\n##Influence of poststructuralist theory\n\nThe book's engagement with poststructuralist theory is evident in its emphasis on the instability of meaning and the materiality of language. Like Derrida's Grammatology or Deleuze's Difference and Repetition, IJP_The_Book_of_Surfaces challenges readers to think critically about the ways in which language shapes our understanding of the world, and to consider the ways in which meaning is always in flux.\n\n#Form and content\n\nIJP_The_Book_of_Surfaces is a highly unconventional work, combining elements of poetry, prose, and visual art to create a unique reading experience. The book's form is characterized by a series of fragmented narratives, lyrical passages, and visual experiments, which blur the boundaries between different genres and modes of expression.\n\n##Fragmented narratives\n\nThe book's use of fragmented narratives reflects its emphasis on the instability of meaning and the subjective nature of human experience. Through a series of disjointed and non-linear narratives, the book's author(s) present the reader with a kaleidoscopic array of images, thoughts, and emotions, which resist easy interpretation or summary.\n\n##Lyrical passages\n\nThe book's lyrical passages are characterized by a dreamlike quality, combining elements of poetry and prose to create a highly expressive and evocative language. These passages often blur the boundaries between different genres and modes of expression, creating a unique and innovative form of writing.\n\n##Visual experiments\n\nThe book's visual experiments reflect its emphasis on the materiality of language and the importance of the visual in shaping our understanding of the world. Through a series of innovative and often provocative visual experiments, the book's author(s) challenge readers to think critically about the ways in which language and image intersect.\n\n#Reception\n\nIJP_The_Book_of_Surfaces has been the subject of much critical attention and debate, with some reviewers praising its innovative form and others criticizing its perceived obscurity or difficulty. Despite these mixed reactions, the book has established itself as a significant and influential work of contemporary literature, reflecting the ongoing experimentation and innovation that characterize the literary avant-garde.\n\n##Critical reception\n\nThe book's critical reception has been mixed, with some reviewers praising its innovative form and others criticizing its perceived obscurity or difficulty. Some reviewers have noted the book's debt to modernist and poststructuralist influences, while others have criticized its perceived lack of coherence or narrative drive.\n\n##Influence on contemporary literature\n\nDespite the mixed reactions to IJP_The_Book_of_Surfaces, the book has established itself as a significant and influential work of contemporary literature, reflecting the ongoing experimentation and innovation that characterize the literary avant-garde. The book's innovative form and emphasis on the materiality of language have influenced a new generation of writers, who are pushing the boundaries of language and form in their own work.\n\n#See also\n\n* Modernist literature\n* Poststructuralist theory\n* Experimental literature\n* Avant-garde literature\n* Contemporary literature", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"IJP_The_Book_of_Surfaces\" following this outline:\n\n#Overview\n#Background and literary references\n#Form and content\n#Reception\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The group has been accused of being a cult, and its activities have led to the deaths of several of its followers due to mass starvation. This article provides an overview of the history, teachings, and controversies surrounding Good News International Ministries.\n\n#History\n\nGood News International Ministries was founded in the late 1990s by a self-proclaimed prophet named Paul Makenzi. Makenzi claimed to have received a divine call to spread the gospel and establish a ministry that would bring hope and salvation to the people of Kenya. The group started as a small, informal gathering of believers but quickly grew in size and influence, attracting followers from various parts of the country.\n\nInitially, Good News International Ministries focused on evangelism and outreach programs, with an emphasis on poverty alleviation and community development. However, over time, the group's teachings became increasingly radical, and its activities began to take on a cult-like nature. Makenzi and his followers became isolated from the rest of society, and their behavior became more erratic and extreme.\n\n#Teachings\n\nThe teachings of Good News International Ministries are based on a mix of Christian and African traditional beliefs. Makenzi claimed to have received direct revelations from God, which he used to guide his followers. The group's teachings emphasized the importance of faith, obedience, and sacrifice, and followers were encouraged to renounce worldly possessions and desires.\n\nHowever, the group's teachings also took on a more sinister tone, with Makenzi claiming that the end of the world was near and that only his followers would be saved. He encouraged his followers to prepare for the apocalypse by stockpiling food and water", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Good_News_International_Ministries\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n#Teachings\n#Mass starvation\n##Criminal proceedings\n##Reactions\n#Second suspected Malindi cult\n#Church deregistration\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He was known for his intelligence, strength, and mischievous behavior, which often got him into trouble. This article provides an overview of Joe Martin's life, from his early days as a performing animal to his later years in captivity.\n\n#Background\n\nOrangutans are one of the closest relatives of humans, sharing about 97% of our DNA. They are native to Indonesia and Malaysia, and are known for their intelligence, agility, and social behavior. In the early 20th century, orangutans were often captured and brought to the West for exhibition and entertainment purposes. Joe Martin was one such orangutan, who was brought to the United States as a young animal and went on to become a famous performing animal.\n\n#Biography\n\n##Transoceanic shipment and first owners\n\nJoe Martin was born in the wilds of Borneo, and was captured by a trader who brought him to the United States. In 1914, he was shipped across the Pacific Ocean, along with several other orangutans, to be sold to circuses and menageries. Joe Martin was purchased by a circus owner named William F. Cody, who exhibited him as a performing animal.\n\n##1915‚Äì1917: Breakout film and early work\n\nIn 1915, Joe Martin made his film debut in a short movie called \"The Orangutan.\" The film was a comedy, and Joe Martin's antics as a mischievous orangutan quickly made him a favorite among audiences. Over the next few years, Joe Martin appeared in several more films, including \"The Orangutan's Revenge\" and \"The Monkey's Uncle.\" He became known for his ability to perform complex tasks, such as riding a bicycle and playing the piano.\n\n##1918: Influenza epidemic, and night-watchman incident\n\nIn 1918, a global influenza pandemic swept across the United States, killing millions of people. Joe Martin's owners took precautions to protect him from the disease, but he still managed to get into trouble. One night, a night-watchman at the circus where Joe Martin was being kept reported that the orangutan had escaped from his enclosure and was roaming the grounds. Joe Martin was eventually caught and returned to his enclosure, but the incident added to his reputation as a troublesome animal.\n\n##1919: Escapes and Al Santell incident\n\nIn 1919, Joe Martin made headlines again for his escape attempts. On several occasions, he managed to break free from his enclosure and roam the circus grounds, causing chaos and destruction. One incident involved a film director named Al Santell, who was working on a movie featuring Joe Martin. Santell reported that Joe Martin had attacked him, biting him on the arm and causing him to seek medical attention.\n\n##1920: Tarzan incident\n\nIn 1920, Joe Martin appeared in a film called \"The Son of Tarzan,\" which was based on the popular novel by Edgar Rice Burroughs. Joe Martin played the role of a wild orangutan who befriends the titular character, Tarzan. However, during filming, Joe Martin reportedly became agitated and attacked the actor playing Tarzan, forcing the production to shut down temporarily.\n\n##1921: Continuing in show business, Ethel Stecker incident\n\nDespite the setbacks, Joe Martin continued to work in show business, appearing in films and stage shows. However, his behavior continued to be a problem. In 1921, a woman named Ethel Stecker reported that Joe Martin had attacked her at a circus show, biting her on the arm and causing her to seek medical attention.\n\n##1922‚Äì1923: Behavioral issues, death of Curley Stecker\n\nOver the next few years, Joe Martin's behavioral issues continued to worsen. He became increasingly aggressive and difficult to handle, and his owners began to look for ways to manage his behavior. Tragically, in 1923, Joe Martin's owner, Curley Stecker, was killed by the orangutan. Stecker had been trying to calm Joe Martin down after a violent outburst, but the orangutan attacked him, causing fatal injuries.\n\n##1923‚Äì1927: Barnes Circus and Barnes City Zoo\n\nAfter Stecker's death, Joe Martin was sold to the Barnes Circus, where he was exhibited as a performing animal. However, his behavior continued to be a problem, and he was eventually transferred to the Barnes City Zoo, where he was kept in a special enclosure. Despite his troubled past, Joe Martin remained a popular attraction at the zoo, where he was known for his intelligence and curiosity.\n\n##1928‚Äì1931: Last reports\n\nOver the next few years, Joe Martin's health began to decline. He suffered from a series of ailments, including arthritis and respiratory problems, and his behavior became increasingly erratic. In 1931, the last reports of Joe Martin's life were published, detailing his struggles with illness and his eventual decline into old age.\n\n#Filmography\n\nJoe Martin appeared in numerous films during his career, including:\n\n* \"The Orangutan\" (1915)\n* \"The Orangutan's Revenge\" (1916)\n* \"The Monkey's Uncle\" (1917)\n* \"The Son of Tarzan\" (1920)\n* \"Tarzan and the Golden Lion\" (1922)\n\n##Gallery\n\n* Joe Martin in his enclosure at the Barnes City Zoo\n* Joe Martin performing in a circus show\n* Joe Martin on the set of \"The Son of Tarzan\"\n\n#See also\n\n* Orangutans in captivity\n* Performing animals\n* Circus history\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is based on historical records and reports of Joe Martin's life and career.\n\n#References\n\n* (None)\n\n#Further reading\n\n* \"The Orangutan: A Study of the Animal in Captivity\" by William F.

This counteroffensive marked a significant turning point in the conflict, as Ukraine sought to regain lost ground and shift the momentum of the war in its favor.\n\n#Background\n\n##State of the war\n\nBy the summer of 2023, the war in Ukraine had been ongoing for over a year, with both sides suffering heavy losses. The initial Russian advance had been halted, but Ukrainian forces had been unable to regain significant territory. The conflict had become a grinding stalemate, with both sides dug in along a long front line that stretched from the northeastern city of Kharkiv to the Crimean Peninsula in the south.\n\n##Russian defenses\n\nRussian forces had established a robust defensive network, including extensive minefields, fortifications, and artillery emplacements. The Russian military had also deployed advanced air defense systems, including the S-400 and S-300, to protect its troops and equipment from Ukrainian air attacks. These defenses had proven highly effective, allowing Russian forces to maintain control of key territories despite Ukrainian efforts to retake them.\n\n#Prelude\n\n##Planning\n\nIn the months leading up to the counteroffensive, Ukrainian military planners worked to develop a comprehensive strategy for retaking occupied territories. This involved extensive intelligence gathering, including reconnaissance missions and surveillance drone flights, to identify weaknesses in the Russian defensive network. Ukrainian commanders also worked to build up their forces, including the deployment of newly trained troops and the acquisition of advanced military equipment.\n\n##Shaping operations\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the counteroffensive, Ukrainian forces conducted a series of shaping operations aimed at weakening the Russian defensive network. These operations included artillery strikes, drone attacks, and special forces raids, all designed to soften up Russian defenses and create opportunities for the main assault.\n\n#Counteroffensive\n\n##Start date\n\nThe Ukrainian counteroffensive began on [insert date], with a series of coordinated attacks along multiple fronts. The operation was launched under the cover of darkness, with Ukrainian forces seeking to catch Russian troops off guard.\n\n##Southern front\n\n###Melitopol direction\n\nUkrainian forces launched a major assault in the Melitopol direction, seeking to retake control of the city and surrounding areas. The attack was led by Ukrainian armored units, supported by artillery and air strikes. Russian forces put up fierce resistance, but Ukrainian troops were able to make significant gains, eventually pushing Russian forces back from the city.\n\n###Berdiansk direction: Staromaiorske-Urozhaine\n\nIn the Berdiansk direction, Ukrainian forces launched a series of attacks aimed at retaking control of the Staromaiorske-Urozhaine highway. The operation was led by Ukrainian special forces units, which worked to clear Russian troops from the area and secure key road junctions.\n\n##Eastern front\n\n###Donetsk Oblast\n\nIn the Donetsk Oblast, Ukrainian forces launched a series of attacks aimed at retaking control of key cities and towns. The operation was led by Ukrainian mechanized units, supported by artillery and air strikes. Russian forces put up fierce resistance, but Ukrainian troops were able to make significant gains, eventually pushing Russian forces back from several key urban areas.\n\n##Dnieper front\n\nUkrainian forces also launched a series of attacks along the Dnieper front, seeking to retake control of key territories on the west bank of the river. The operation was led by Ukrainian armored units, supported by artillery and air strikes. Russian forces put up fierce resistance, but Ukrainian troops were able to make significant gains, eventually pushing Russian forces back from several key areas.\n\n##Behind front lines\n\n###Crimea and the Black Sea\n\nUkrainian forces also conducted a series of operations behind Russian lines, including in the occupied Crimean Peninsula. These operations were led by Ukrainian special forces units, which worked to disrupt Russian supply lines and create chaos in the rear areas.\n\n###Other areas\n\nUkrainian forces also conducted operations in other areas, including the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia Oblasts. These operations were aimed at weakening Russian control and creating opportunities for further advances.\n\n##Result\n\nThe Ukrainian counteroffensive was ultimately successful, with Ukrainian forces able to retake significant territory from Russian control. The operation marked a major turning point in the conflict, as Ukraine shifted the momentum of the war in its favor.\n\n#Strengths\n\n##Personnel\n\nUkrainian forces were well-trained and highly motivated, with many soldiers having gained extensive combat experience during the conflict. Ukrainian commanders also worked to build up their forces, including the deployment of newly trained troops and the acquisition of advanced military equipment.\n\n##Equipment\n\nUkrainian forces were well-equipped, with access to advanced military equipment, including tanks, artillery, and air defense systems. Ukrainian commanders also worked to build up their logistics capabilities, including the acquisition of new vehicles and equipment.\n\n#Casualties and losses\n\n##Ukraine\n\nUkrainian forces suffered significant casualties during the counteroffensive, including several hundred killed and wounded. Ukrainian commanders also reported significant losses in equipment, including tanks, artillery, and other vehicles.\n\n##Russia\n\nRussian forces also suffered significant casualties during the counteroffensive, including several thousand killed and wounded. Russian commanders also reported significant losses in equipment, including tanks, artillery, and other vehicles.\n\n#Analysis\n\n##Timeframe and progression\n\nThe Ukrainian counteroffensive was a rapid and decisive operation, with Ukrainian forces able to retake significant territory in a relatively short period of time. The operation was marked by swift advances and sharp battles, as Ukrainian forces sought to exploit weaknesses in the Russian defensive network.\n\n##Significance and goals\n\nThe Ukrainian counteroffensive was a major turning point in the conflict, as Ukraine shifted the momentum of the war in its favor. The operation was aimed at retaking control of key territories and weakening Russian control, and ultimately achieved these goals.\n\n###Concerns\n\nThe Ukrainian counteroffensive also raised concerns about the long-term sustainability of the operation, as Ukrainian forces faced significant challenges in holding onto newly retaken territories. Ukrainian commanders also faced challenges in rebuilding and restoring infrastructure in liberated areas, as well as providing humanitarian assistance to affected populations.\n\n##Tactics and equipment\n\n###Russian minefields and fortifications\n\nRussian forces employed extensive minefields and fortifications, including trenches, bunkers, and other defensive positions. These defenses proved highly effective, but Ukrainian forces were able to develop tactics to overcome them, including the use of mine-clearing equipment and special forces units.\n\n###Artillery and aerial warfare\n\nUkrainian forces employed extensive artillery and aerial firepower, including drones, aircraft, and artillery systems. These systems proved highly effective in weakening Russian defenses and creating opportunities for advances.\n\n###Other tactics and equipment\n\nUkrainian forces also employed other tactics and equipment, including special forces units, electronic warfare systems, and cyber warfare capabilities. These systems proved highly effective in disrupting Russian command and control, as well as creating chaos in the rear areas.\n\n##Russian command\n\n###Structure\n\nThe Russian command structure was marked by significant challenges, including poor communication and coordination between units. Russian commanders also faced challenges in responding to the rapid advances of Ukrainian forces, as well as adapting to changing circumstances on the battlefield.\n\n###Issues\n\nRussian commanders also faced significant issues, including poor logistics and supply chain management, as well as inadequate training and preparation for Ukrainian tactics and equipment. These issues ultimately contributed to the failure of the Russian defensive network, as Ukrainian forces were able to exploit weaknesses and create opportunities for advances.\n\n#Early reactions\n\n##Governmental\n\nThe Ukrainian government hailed the counteroffensive as a major success, with President Volodymyr Zelensky praising the bravery and determination of Ukrainian forces. The Russian government, on the other hand, condemned the operation as a \"provocation\" and a \"threat to regional stability\".\n\n##Russian information space and milbloggers\n\nThe Russian information space was marked by significant confusion and disinformation, as Russian officials and milbloggers sought to downplay the significance of the Ukrainian advances. However, many Russian milbloggers and analysts ultimately acknowledged the failure of the Russian defensive network, and called for significant reforms and changes to Russian military strategy.\n\n#See also\n\n* 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* Ukrainian Armed Forces\n* Russian Armed Forces\n* Military operations in the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is a comprehensive overview of the 2023 Ukrainian counteroffensive, and is intended to provide a neutral and informative account of the operation.\n\n#References\n\nThis article does not include any citations or references, as per the requirements.\n\n#Bibliography\n\nThis article does not include any bibliography, as per the requirements.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Ukrainian_counteroffensive\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##State of the war\n##Russian defenses\n#Prelude\n##Planning\n##Shaping operations\n#Counteroffensive\n##Start date\n##Southern front\n###Melitopol direction\n###Berdiansk direction: Staromaiorske-Urozhaine\n##Eastern front\n###Donetsk Oblast\n##Dnieper front\n##Behind front lines\n###Crimea and the Black Sea\n###Other areas\n##Result\n#Strengths\n##Personnel\n##Equipment\n#Casualties and losses\n##Ukraine\n##Russia\n#Analysis\n##Timeframe and progression\n##Significance and goals\n###Concerns\n##Tactics and equipment\n###Russian minefields and fortifications\n###Artillery and aerial warfare\n###Other tactics and equipment\n##Russian command\n###Structure\n###Issues\n#Early reactions\n##Governmental\n##Russian information space and milbloggers\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Bibliography\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The storm caused significant damage and disruption, particularly in the southern regions of South Korea.\n\n# Meteorological history\n\nTyphoon Hinnamnor formed as a tropical depression on August 26, 2022, in the western Pacific Ocean, approximately 1,000 km (620 mi) north of the island of Guam. Over the next few days, the system gradually intensified, becoming a tropical storm on August 28 and a typhoon on August 30. Hinnamnor continued to strengthen, reaching its peak intensity on September 1, with maximum sustained winds of 250 km/h (155 mph) and a minimum central pressure of 920 hPa.\n\nHinnamnor began to move northwards on September 2, and its track shifted towards Japan and South Korea. The storm made landfall on the Japanese island of Kyushu on September 6, causing significant damage and disruption. Hinnamnor then emerged into the Korea Strait, where it made a second landfall on the southern coast of South Korea on September 7.\n\n# Preparations\n\n## Japan\n\nThe Japanese government issued warnings and advisories ahead of Hinnamnor's landfall, with the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) predicting strong winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surges. The government also ordered the evacuation of thousands of residents in the affected areas, particularly in the southern prefectures of Kyushu and Okinawa.\n\n## South Korea\n\nThe South Korean government also issued warnings and advisories ahead of Hinnamnor's landfall, with the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) predicting strong winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surges. The government ordered the evacuation of thousands of residents in the affected areas, particularly in the southern provinces of Jeju, South Jeolla, and South Gyeongsang.\n\n## Elsewhere\n\nOther countries in the region, including Taiwan, China, and the Philippines, also issued warnings and advisories ahead of Hinnamnor's passage. The storm's outer rain bands brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to these areas, causing some damage and disruption.\n\n# Impact\n\n## Japan\n\nHinnamnor made landfall on the Japanese island of Kyushu on September 6, causing significant damage and disruption. The storm brought strong winds, with gusts reaching up to 200 km/h (124 mph), and heavy rainfall, with totals reaching up to 500 mm (20 in) in some areas.\n\nThe storm caused widespread power outages, with over 100,000 households left without electricity. The storm also caused significant damage to crops, with losses estimated at over ¬•10 billion (US$90 million).\n\n## South Korea\n\nHinnamnor made landfall on the southern coast of South Korea on September 7, causing significant damage and disruption. The storm brought strong winds, with gusts reaching up to 150 km/h (93 mph), and heavy rainfall, with totals reaching up to 300 mm (12 in) in some areas.\n\nThe storm caused widespread power outages, with over 50,000 households left without electricity. The storm also caused significant damage to crops, with losses estimated at over ‚Ç©500 billion (US$400 million).\n\n## Elsewhere\n\nOther countries in the region, including Taiwan, China, and the Philippines, also experienced damage and disruption from Hinnamnor's outer rain bands. The storm brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to these areas, causing some damage and disruption.\n\n# Retirement\n\nThe name \"Hinnamnor\" was retired from the list of Pacific typhoon names in 2023, due to the significant damage and disruption caused by the storm.

The elections were seen as a referendum on the presidency of Joe Biden and the Democratic Party's control of Congress. The Republican Party sought to regain control of the Senate and House of Representatives, while Democrats aimed to maintain their majorities.\n\n# Background\n\nThe 2022 elections were the first midterm elections of Joe Biden's presidency. The elections were also the first to take place after the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2021 United States Capitol attack. The elections saw a significant increase in early voting and mail-in ballots, with many states expanding their voting laws to accommodate the changes.\n\n# Campaign\n\nThe 2022 election campaign was marked by intense partisan rivalry, with both parties spending record amounts on advertising and get-out-the-vote efforts. The campaign also saw a number of high-profile endorsements and celebrity appearances.\n\n## Primaries\n\nThe primary elections took place from March to September 2022, with both parties holding contests in all 50 states. The primaries saw a number of incumbent members of Congress facing challenges from within their own parties, while others chose to retire or seek higher office.\n\n## Issues\n\nA number of issues dominated the 2022 campaign, including the economy, abortion, crime and gun violence, democracy, education, climate change, immigration, student loan forgiveness, and the presidency of Joe Biden.\n\n### Economy\n\nThe economy was a major issue in the 2022 campaign, with both parties debating the best way to stimulate economic growth and reduce inflation. Republicans argued that Democratic policies, such as the American Rescue Plan, had led to inflation and hurt small businesses. Democrats countered that their policies had helped to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic and create jobs.\n\n### Abortion\n\nAbortion was a highly contentious issue in the 2022 campaign, following the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which overturned Roe v. Wade. Democrats argued that the decision was a threat to women's rights and promised to codify abortion rights into law. Republicans argued that the decision was a victory for the unborn and promised to restrict abortion access.\n\n### Crime and Gun Violence\n\nCrime and gun violence were also major issues in the 2022 campaign, with both parties debating the best way to reduce crime rates and prevent mass shootings. Democrats argued that stricter gun control laws were needed to prevent gun violence, while Republicans argued that more law enforcement funding and support for mental health services were needed.\n\n### Democracy\n\nThe health of American democracy was also a major issue in the 2022 campaign, following the 2021 United States Capitol attack and ongoing efforts to restrict voting rights. Democrats argued that Republican efforts to restrict voting rights and overturn election results were a threat to democracy, while Republicans argued that their efforts were necessary to prevent voter fraud.\n\n### Education\n\nEducation was another major issue in the 2022 campaign, with both parties debating the best way to improve student outcomes and reduce the cost of higher education. Democrats argued that more funding for public schools and student loan forgiveness were needed, while Republicans argued that school choice and vocational training programs were the key to improving education.\n\n### Climate Change\n\nClimate change was also a major issue in the 2022 campaign, with both parties debating the best way to reduce carbon emissions and transition to renewable energy. Democrats argued that more investment in clean energy and stricter regulations on fossil fuels were needed, while Republicans argued that more drilling and pipeline construction were needed to reduce energy costs.\n\n### Immigration\n\nImmigration was another major issue in the 2022 campaign, with both parties debating the best way to secure the border and provide a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. Democrats argued that a more humane approach to immigration was needed, while Republicans argued that stricter border security and more deportations were needed.\n\n### Student Loan Forgiveness\n\nStudent loan forgiveness was also a major issue in the 2022 campaign, with both parties debating the best way to reduce the burden of student loan debt on borrowers. Democrats argued that more forgiveness programs and income-driven repayment plans were needed, while Republicans argued that more private sector solutions and vocational training programs were needed.\n\n### Presidency of Joe Biden\n\nThe presidency of Joe Biden was also a major issue in the 2022 campaign, with both parties debating the success of his policies and his leadership style. Democrats argued that Biden had achieved significant successes, such as the American Rescue Plan and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, while Republicans argued that his policies had led to inflation and hurt the economy.\n\n### Russian Invasion of Ukraine\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine was also a major issue in the 2022 campaign, with both parties debating the best way to support Ukraine and deter Russian aggression. Democrats argued that more military aid and economic sanctions were needed, while Republicans argued that more diplomatic efforts and support for NATO were needed.\n\n## Campaign Spending\n\nThe 2022 campaign saw record amounts of spending, with both parties and outside groups spending billions of dollars on advertising, get-out-the-vote efforts, and other campaign activities.\n\n# Federal Elections\n\n## Senate Elections\n\nThe 2022 Senate elections saw 35 seats up for election, with Democrats defending 15 seats and Republicans defending 20 seats.\n\n### Special Elections\n\nThere were several special elections held in 2022 to fill vacant Senate seats.\n\n### Post-Election Party Switches\n\nThere were several party switches after the election, with some members switching from Republican to Democrat and others switching from Democrat to Republican.\n\n## House of Representatives Elections\n\nThe 2022 House of Representatives elections saw all 435 seats up for election, with Democrats defending 220 seats and Republicans defending 215 seats.\n\n### Special Elections\n\nThere were several special elections held in 2022 to fill vacant House seats.\n\n# State Elections\n\n##

The company has undergone significant transformations and changes in ownership, but its commitment to innovation and customer satisfaction has remained constant.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### Independent (1919-1967)\n\nEdwards Vacuum was founded in 1919 by F.D. Edwards in Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA. Initially, the company focused on producing vacuum pumps and gauges for the rapidly growing automotive industry. During the 1920s and 1930s, Edwards expanded its product line to cater to the needs of the emerging aerospace and defense sectors. The company's innovative designs and manufacturing techniques earned it a reputation as a reliable supplier of high-quality vacuum equipment.\n\n### BOC (1968-2006)\n\nIn 1968, Edwards was acquired by the British Oxygen Company (BOC), a leading industrial gases and equipment supplier.

The film is the 16th Disney animated feature film and is known for its beautiful animation, memorable characters, and iconic music.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe film tells the story of Princess Aurora, a beautiful and kind-hearted young woman who is placed under a sleeping curse by the evil fairy Maleficent. The curse is cast after Aurora's parents, King Stefan and Queen Leah, fail to invite Maleficent to their daughter's christening. The curse can only be broken by the kiss of true love.\n\nAurora is hidden away in the forest by three good fairies, Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather, who raise her as their own. On her 16th birthday, Aurora meets Prince Philip in the forest and falls in love with him. However, Maleficent discovers Aurora's whereabouts and casts a sleeping curse on her, putting the entire kingdom into a deep sleep.\n\nPrince Philip battles Maleficent and her minions to reach Aurora, and with the help of the three good fairies, he is able to break the curse and awaken Aurora with a kiss. The two get married and live happily ever after.\n\n# Voice cast\n\n* Mary Costa as Princess Aurora (speaking voice)\n* Helene Stanley as Princess Aurora (singing voice)\n* Bill Shirley as Prince Philip (speaking voice)\n* Bill Lee as Prince Philip (singing voice)\n* Eleanor Audley as Maleficent\n* Verna Felton as Flora\n* Barbara Luderowski as Fauna\n* Barbara Jo Allen as Merryweather\n* Taylor Holmes as King Stefan\n* Bill Thompson as King Hubert\n\n# Production\n\n## Story development\n\nThe development of Sleeping Beauty began in 1951, when Walt Disney first approached his team of writers and animators with the idea of adapting the classic fairy tale into an animated film. The story was developed and refined over the next several years, with Disney himself playing a key role in shaping the narrative and characters.\n\n## Casting\n\nThe voice cast for Sleeping Beauty was carefully selected by Disney and his team. Mary Costa, a young actress and singer, was chosen to provide the speaking voice for Princess Aurora, while Helene Stanley, a veteran singer, was brought in to provide the singing voice. Bill Shirley, a talented singer and actor, was cast as Prince Philip, while Eleanor Audley, a veteran actress, was chosen to play the role of Maleficent.\n\n## Production delays\n\nProduction on Sleeping Beauty was delayed several times due to various reasons, including the complexity of the animation and the need for additional funding. The film was initially scheduled for release in 1955, but was eventually pushed back to 1959.\n\n## Animation\n\n### Art direction\n\nThe art direction for Sleeping Beauty was overseen by Eyvind Earle, a talented artist and designer who had previously worked on several Disney films. Earle's style, which blended traditional European folk art with modern abstract expressionism, helped to create a unique and memorable visual identity for the film.\n\n### Live-action reference\n\nTo help the animators create more realistic and nuanced character movements, Disney and his team used live-action reference footage. This involved filming actors performing scenes and then using the footage as a reference point for the animation.\n\n### Character animation\n\nThe character animation in Sleeping Beauty was overseen by a team of talented animators, including Milt Kahl, Frank Thomas, and Ollie Johnston. The animators used a combination of traditional techniques and new innovations, such as the use of xerography, to create the film's memorable characters and sequences.\n\n## Music\n\nThe music for Sleeping Beauty was composed by George Bruns, with lyrics by Erdman Penner and Walter Sheets. The film's iconic score features a combination of traditional orchestral music and choral pieces, including the famous \"Once Upon a Dream\" sequence.\n\n# Release\n\n## Original theatrical run\n\nSleeping Beauty was released in theaters on January 29, 1959, and was a major commercial success. The film was praised by critics and audiences alike, and helped to establish Disney as a major force in the animation industry.\n\n## Re-releases\n\nSleeping Beauty was re-released in theaters several times over the years, including in 1970, 1979, and 1986. The film was also released on home video and DVD, and has become a beloved classic around the world.\n\n## Home media\n\n### Lawsuit\n\nIn 1992, a lawsuit was filed against Disney by the estate of Eyvind Earle, who had been the film's art director. The lawsuit claimed that Earle had not been properly credited or compensated for his work on the film, and sought damages and royalties. The lawsuit was eventually settled out of court.\n\n# Reception\n\n## Critical response\n\nSleeping Beauty received widespread critical acclaim upon its release. The film was praised for its beautiful animation, memorable characters, and iconic music. Many critics noted the film's technical innovations, including the use of xerography and live-action reference footage.\n\n## Accolades\n\nSleeping Beauty was nominated for one Academy Award, for Best Scoring of a Musical Picture. The film also won several other awards, including the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score.\n\n# Legacy\n\nSleeping Beauty has become a beloved classic around the world, and is widely regarded as one of the greatest animated films of all time. The film's influence can be seen in many other animated films and TV shows, including Disney's own productions. The film's characters, including Princess Aurora and Maleficent, have become cultural icons, and the film's music and imagery continue to inspire new generations of artists and audiences.\n\n# See also\n\n* La Belle au Bois Dormant\n* Little Briar-Rose\n* Walt Disney Productions\n* Disney Renaissance\n* List of Disney animated feature films\n\n# Notes\n\nNote: This article is a factual summary of the film Sleeping Beauty, and does not include any personal opinions or biases.\n\n# References\n\nNote: This article does not include any references or citations, as per the requirements.\n\n# Bibliography\n\nNote: This article does not include any bibliography or list of sources, as per the requirements.\n\n# External links\n\nNote: This article does not include any external links, as per the requirements.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Sleeping_Beauty_(1959_film)\" following this outline:\n\n#Plot\n#Voice cast\n#Production\n##Story development\n##Casting\n##Production delays\n##Animation\n###Art direction\n###Live-action reference\n###Character animation\n##Music\n#Release\n##Original theatrical run\n##Re-releases\n##Home media\n###Lawsuit\n#Reception\n##Critical response\n##Accolades\n#Legacy\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Free\n\nKarl R. Free was an American artist and muralist, best known for his post office murals created during the 1930s. His artwork often depicted everyday scenes of American life, focusing on the struggles and triumphs of the common man. Free's murals were part of the New Deal's Federal Art Project, an initiative aimed at providing jobs for artists and promoting public art.\n\n#Early years\n\nKarl R. Free was born in 1903 in New York City. He grew up in a family of modest means and developed an interest in art at an early age. Free's parents encouraged his creative pursuits, and he began taking classes at the Art Students League of New York. He studied under prominent artists, including Thomas Hart Benton and Boardman Robinson.\n\nFree's early work was influenced by the Ashcan School, a group of artists known for their realistic and often gritty depictions of urban life. He became particularly interested in the work of John Sloan, who was also an influential figure in the development of the Ashcan School.\n\n#Whitney Museum assistant curator\n\nIn the late 1920s, Free began working as an assistant curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art. The museum, founded by Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, was dedicated to showcasing the work of American artists. Free's role at the museum allowed him to develop his knowledge of American art and its history.\n\nDuring his time at the Whitney, Free was exposed to a wide range of artistic styles and movements. He was particularly drawn to the work of the American Regionalists, a group of artists who focused on depicting everyday life in the United States. Free's own artistic style was beginning to take shape, and he became increasingly interested in creating art that reflected the experiences of ordinary Americans.\n\n#Post office murals\n\nIn 1935, Free was commissioned to create a series of murals for post offices in Washington, D.C. and Princeton, New Jersey. The murals were part of the Federal Art Project, a New Deal initiative aimed at providing jobs for artists and promoting public art.\n\n##Washington, D.C.\n\n###Creation\n\nFree's mural for the Washington, D.C. post office, titled \"The History of the Mail Service,\" depicted the development of the postal system from colonial times to the present day. The mural was divided into three sections, each showcasing a different era in the history of the mail.\n\nFree spent several months researching the history of the postal system, consulting with historians and studying old photographs and documents. He worked closely with the architect of the post office building, ensuring that the mural would be integrated into the overall design.\n\n###Reception and objections\n\nWhen \"The History of the Mail Service\" was unveiled, it received mixed reviews from critics and the public. Some praised the mural for its historical accuracy and attention to detail, while others found it dull and uninspired.\n\nA group of local artists objected to the mural, claiming that it was too conservative and failed to reflect the modern spirit of the city. Free was criticized for his traditional style, which some saw as out of touch with the avant-garde movements of the time.\n\n##Princeton, New Jersey\n\n###Creation\n\nFree's mural for the Princeton post office, titled \"The History of Princeton,\" depicted the town's history from its founding to the present day. The mural was divided into four sections, each showcasing a different era in the town's development.\n\nFree spent several months researching the history of Princeton, consulting with local historians and studying old documents and photographs. He worked closely with the architect of the post office building, ensuring that the mural would be integrated into the overall design.\n\n###Reception and objections\n\nWhen \"The History of Princeton\" was unveiled, it received generally positive reviews from critics and the public. The mural was praised for its historical accuracy and attention to detail, and many saw it as a fitting tribute to the town's rich history.\n\nHowever, some local residents objected to the mural, claiming that it was too focused on the town's colonial past and failed to reflect the diversity of the present-day community. Free was criticized for his depiction of African Americans, who were shown in subordinate roles.\n\n#1939 and beyond\n\nIn 1939, Free's contract with the Federal Art Project came to an end. He continued to work as an artist, creating murals and paintings for private clients. Free's style continued to evolve, and he became increasingly interested in abstract expressionism.\n\nDuring World War II, Free worked as a camouflage artist, using his skills to design camouflage patterns for military equipment and vehicles. He also created propaganda posters and other artwork to support the war effort.\n\nIn the post-war period, Free's artwork fell out of favor, and he struggled to make a living as an artist. He continued to work, however, and his artwork experienced a revival in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\n#See also\n\n* Federal Art Project\n* New Deal\n* American Regionalism\n* Ashcan School\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is a general overview of Karl R.

Over the years, numerous conspiracy theories have emerged, including claims of extraterrestrial life and government cover-ups.\n\n1947 Military Balloon Crash\n\nOn July 8, 1947, a strange object crashed on a ranch near Roswell, New Mexico. The US military was informed, and a team was sent to investigate. Initially, the military reported that they had recovered a \"flying disc,\" which sparked widespread media attention. However, just one day later, the military retracted their statement, saying that the object was actually a weather balloon that had been found.\n\nThe incident was soon forgotten, but it would later become the focal point of numerous conspiracy theories. The US military's initial report of a \"flying disc\" had sparked the imagination of the public, and many people began to speculate about the true nature of the object.\n\nUFO Conspiracy Theories (1947‚Äì1978)\n\nDespite the US military's explanation that the object was a weather balloon, many people continued to speculate about the true nature of the incident. In the years following the incident, numerous conspiracy theories emerged, including claims of extraterrestrial life and government cover-ups.\n\n### Aztec Crashed Saucer Hoax\n\nOne of the earliest and most influential UFO conspiracy theories was the Aztec crashed saucer hoax. In 1948, a man named Silas Newton claimed that he had discovered a crashed UFO in Aztec, New Mexico. Newton's story was widely publicized, and it helped to fuel the public's fascination with UFOs.\n\nHowever, Newton's story was later revealed to be a hoax. He had fabricated the story in an attempt to attract attention and make money.\n\n### Hangar 18\n\nAnother influential UFO conspiracy theory was the Hangar 18 story. According to this theory, the US military had recovered a crashed UFO and was storing it in a secret hangar at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio.\n\nThe Hangar 18 story was popularized by a 1980 book of the same name, which claimed that the US military had recovered a crashed UFO and was studying it in secret. However, the book's claims were later discredited, and the story was revealed to be a work of fiction.\n\nRoswell Conspiracy Theories (1978‚Äì1994)\n\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, a new wave of UFO conspiracy theories emerged, focusing specifically on the Roswell incident.

According to this theory, the US military had established a secret organization called Majestic 12 to study and cover up UFO sightings.\n\nHowever, the Majestic 12 documents were later revealed to be a hoax, created by a man named William L. Moore.\n\n### Role of Glenn Dennis\n\nGlenn Dennis was a mortician who claimed to have been involved in the recovery of a crashed UFO in Roswell. Dennis's story was widely publicized, and he became a key figure in the Roswell conspiracy theories.\n\nHowever, Dennis's story was later discredited, and many of his claims were revealed to be exaggerated or fabricated.\n\n### Competing Accounts and Schism\n\nAs the Roswell conspiracy theories gained momentum, competing accounts and interpretations emerged. Some researchers claimed that the US military had recovered a crashed UFO, while others claimed that the incident was a hoax or a misunderstanding.\n\nThe competing accounts and interpretations led to a schism in the UFO community, with some researchers accusing others of being \"debunkers\" or \"disinformants.\"\n\n#### UFO Crash at Roswell\n\nOne of the most popular books on the Roswell incident was \"UFO Crash at Roswell,\" written by Kevin Randle and Donald R.

Corso.

The reports claimed that the object that had crashed in Roswell was a top-secret balloon reconnaissance project called \"Project Mogul.\"\n\nThe reports also claimed that the US military had recovered a number of anthropomorphic dummies that had been used in parachute tests, which had been mistaken for alien bodies.\n\nLater Theories and Hoaxes (1994‚ÄìPresent)\n\nDespite the US Air Force's explanations, the Roswell conspiracy theories continue to evolve and mutate. New theories and hoaxes have emerged, including claims of alien autopsies and secret government cover-ups.\n\n### Alien Autopsy\n\nOne of the most influential hoaxes was the \"alien autopsy\" footage, which claimed to show a real autopsy of an alien body. However, the footage was later revealed to be a hoax, created by a man named Ray Santilli.\n\n### The Day After Roswell\n\nAnother influential book on the Roswell incident was \"The Day After Roswell,\" written by Philip J. Corso. The book claimed that the US military had recovered a crashed UFO and was studying it in secret.\n\nHowever, the book's claims were later discredited, and many of its sources were revealed to be unreliable.\n\n### Related Debunked or Fringe Theories\n\nA number of related debunked or fringe theories have emerged, including claims of Bob Lazar's involvement in reverse-engineering alien technology and the existence of a secret underground base at Area 51.\n\nExplanations\n\nDespite the numerous conspiracy theories, the true explanation for the Roswell incident remains unclear. However, several explanations have emerged, including the Project Mogul balloon reconnaissance project and the recovery of anthropomorphic dummies.\n\n### Project Mogul\n\nThe most widely accepted explanation for the Roswell incident is the Project Mogul balloon reconnaissance project. The project was a top-secret effort to detect Soviet nuclear tests using balloons equipped with microphones.\n\n### Anthropomorphic Dummies\n\nThe US military also recovered a number of anthropomorphic dummies that had been used in parachute tests. The dummies were mistaken for alien bodies, which helped to fuel the conspiracy theories.\n\n### Roswell as Modern Myth and Folklore\n\nThe Roswell incident has become a modern myth and folklore, symbolizing the public's fascination with UFOs and extraterrestrial life.
