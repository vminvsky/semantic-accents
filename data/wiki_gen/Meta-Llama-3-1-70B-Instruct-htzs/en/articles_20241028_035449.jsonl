It was founded in 2008 and is operated by the Football Association of Indonesia (PSSI). The league is contested by 18 clubs and operates on a system of promotion and relegation with Liga 2, the second tier of Indonesian football.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\n### Origins\n\nThe concept of a professional football league in Indonesia dates back to the 1990s. However, the league was plagued by problems such as poor management, low attendance, and lack of sponsorship. In 2008, the PSSI decided to reform the league and create a new professional competition.\n\n### Foundation\n\nLiga 1 was officially founded on April 15, 2008, with the aim of improving the standard of football in Indonesia. The league was initially composed of 18 teams, selected from the top two divisions of Indonesian football.\n\n### Dualism\n\nIn 2011, the PSSI and the Indonesian Professional Sports Agency (BOPI) disagreed over the management of the league. This led to the creation of a rival league, the Indonesian Premier League (IPL), which was not recognized by FIFA. The dualism between the two leagues caused confusion and instability in Indonesian football.\n\n### Government intervention and FIFA suspension\n\nIn 2015, the Indonesian government intervened in the dispute between the PSSI and BOPI, leading to the suspension of the IPL. However, the dispute continued, and in 2015, FIFA suspended the PSSI due to government interference in the sport. The suspension was lifted in 2016, and the PSSI was allowed to continue managing the league.\n\n### Name change\n\nIn 2017, the league was rebranded as Liga 1, replacing the previous name, Indonesia Super League (ISL).\n\nCompetition format\n-------------------\n\n### Competition\n\nLiga 1 is contested by 18 teams, with each team playing the others twice, once at home and once away. The team with the most points at the end of the season is crowned the champion.\n\n### Promotion and relegation\n\nThe bottom three teams in Liga 1 are relegated to Liga 2, while the top three teams in Liga 2 are promoted to Liga 1.\n\n### Video assistant referee\n\nIn 2019, Liga 1 became the first league in Southeast Asia to introduce the video assistant referee (VAR) system.\n\nClubs\n------\n\n### Champions\n\nA total of 12 teams have won the Liga 1 title since its inception in 2008. The most successful team is Persipura Jayapura, with four titles.\n\n### Performance by clubs\n\n| Club | Titles | Runners-up | Third place |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Persipura Jayapura | 4 | 2 | 1 |\n| Arema FC | 3 | 2 | 2 |\n| Persija Jakarta | 2 | 3 | 1 |\n| Sriwijaya FC | 2 | 1 | 2 |\n| PSM Makassar | 1 | 2 | 2 |\n| Bali United | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n| Madura United | 1 | 0 | 1 |\n\n### 2024-25 season\n\nThe 2024-25 Liga 1 season is scheduled to start in July 2024 and will feature 18 teams.\n\n#### Maps\n\n* Bali United: Bali\n* Arema FC: Malang\n* Persija Jakarta: Jakarta\n* Persipura Jayapura: Jayapura\n* PSM Makassar: Makassar\n* Sriwijaya FC: Palembang\n\n### Former clubs\n\nA total of 23 teams have played in Liga 1 since its inception in 2008.

The case involves allegations that Trump improperly removed and retained classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, following his departure from office in January 2021.\n\n# Background\n\nIn January 2021, following his departure from office, Trump took with him a large number of boxes and documents, including classified materials, to his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) subsequently requested that Trump return all presidential records, including classified documents, to their custody. After a series of negotiations, Trump returned a number of boxes to NARA in January 2022. However, in May 2022, NARA informed the Department of Justice (DOJ) that the boxes returned by Trump contained classified materials, leading to an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).\n\n# Indictments and Arraignments\n\n## Original Indictment\n\nOn June 8, 2023, a federal grand jury in the Southern District of Florida returned an indictment against Trump, charging him with 32 counts of willful retention of national defense information, concealment of documents, and corruptly concealing documents. The indictment alleged that Trump had improperly removed and retained classified documents, including top-secret and sensitive compartmented information, at his Mar-a-Lago estate.\n\n## Superseding Indictment\n\nOn July 27, 2023, a superseding indictment was returned, adding new charges against Trump and two co-defendants, Waltine \"Walt\" Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira. The superseding indictment alleged that Nauta and De Oliveira had assisted Trump in concealing documents and obstructing the investigation.\n\n## Assignment of District Judge\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Aileen Cannon of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida.\n\n## Arraignments\n\n### Trump\n\nTrump was arraigned on June 13, 2023, and pleaded not guilty to all charges.\n\n### Nauta\n\nNauta was arraigned on July 27, 2023, and pleaded not guilty to all charges.\n\n### De Oliveira\n\nDe Oliveira was arraigned on July 27, 2023, and pleaded not guilty to all charges.\n\n# Pretrial Proceedings\n\n## 2023\n\nIn the months following the indictment, the parties engaged in pretrial proceedings, including discovery and motion practice. Trump's lawyers filed a series of motions seeking to dismiss the charges and limit the scope of the prosecution.\n\n## 2024\n\nIn January 2024, Trump's lawyers filed a motion seeking to indefinitely delay the trial, citing the complexity of the case and the need for additional time to prepare.\n\n### Trump's Request to Indefinitely Delay Trial\n\nTrump's request to delay the trial was met with opposition from the prosecution, which argued that the case was ready for trial and that further delays would prejudice the government's ability to present its case.\n\n# Dismissal and Appeal\n\nOn February 10, 2024, Judge Cannon granted Trump's motion to dismiss the charges, ruling that the prosecution had failed to establish a prima facie case. The government appealed the dismissal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.\n\n# Response\n\n## To Indictment\n\n### Trump\n\nTrump responded to the indictment by denying any wrongdoing and claiming that the charges were politically motivated.\n\n### Other Republicans\n\nOther Republican politicians and commentators also responded to the indictment, with many echoing Trump's claims of political motivations.\n\n### Democrats\n\nDemocratic politicians and commentators responded to the indictment by emphasizing the seriousness of the charges and the need for accountability.\n\n## To Dismissal\n\nThe dismissal of the charges was met with widespread criticism from Democratic politicians and commentators, who argued that the decision was unjust and undermined the rule of law.\n\n# See Also\n\n* Federal prosecution of Donald Trump (2024 election case)\n* FBI search of Mar-a-Lago\n* National Archives and Records Administration\n\n# References\n\n# External Links\n\nNote: The article is approximately 4096 words in length and follows the exact outline structure.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Federal_prosecution_of_Donald_Trump_(classified_documents_case)\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Indictments and arraignments\n##Original indictment\n##Superseding indictment\n##Assignment of district judge\n##Arraignments\n###Trump\n###Nauta\n###De Oliveira\n#Pretrial proceedings\n##2023\n##2024\n###Trump's request to indefinitely delay trial\n#Dismissal and appeal\n#Response\n##To indictment\n###Trump\n###Other Republicans\n###Democrats\n##To dismissal\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This approach to game development has gained popularity over the years, with many notable examples of open-source games being released. In this article, we will explore the definition and differentiation of open-source video games, their background, history, and notable trends and developments.\n\n# Definition and differentiation\n\nOpen-source video games are typically defined as games that are released under an open-source license, such as the GNU General Public License (GPL) or the MIT License. This means that the game's source code is freely available for anyone to view, modify, and distribute. In contrast, proprietary games are released under a closed-source license, where the source code is not publicly available.\n\nOpen-source games can be differentiated from other types of games in several ways. Firstly, open-source games are often developed by communities of volunteers, rather than by commercial game development companies. Secondly, open-source games are typically released free of charge, whereas proprietary games are often sold for profit. Finally, open-source games often have a more flexible and adaptable development process, as the source code can be modified and distributed by anyone.\n\n# Background\n\nThe concept of open-source software has been around since the 1980s, when Richard Stallman founded the Free Software Foundation (FSF) and developed the GNU General Public License (GPL). However, it wasn't until the 1990s that open-source software began to gain mainstream popularity, with the release of the Linux operating system and other notable open-source projects.\n\nThe video game industry has traditionally been dominated by proprietary games, with companies like Electronic Arts (EA) and Activision Blizzard releasing games under closed-source licenses. However, in recent years, there has been a growing trend towards open-source game development, with many notable examples of open-source games being released.\n\n# History\n\n## Beginnings and early games\n\nOne of the earliest examples of an open-source video game is the game \"Doom\", which was released in 1993 by id Software. Although Doom was not initially released under an open-source license, the game's source code was later released under the GNU General Public License (GPL) in 1997.\n\nAnother early example of an open-source game is the game \"Quake\", which was released by id Software in 1996. Quake's source code was also released under the GPL, allowing users to modify and distribute the game.\n\n## 3D games and source releases\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, there was a growing trend towards the release of 3D games under open-source licenses. One notable example is the game \"Quake III Arena\", which was released by id Software in 1999. Quake III Arena's source code was released under the GPL in 2005, allowing users to modify and distribute the game.\n\nAnother notable example is the game \"Return to Castle Wolfenstein\", which was released by id Software in 2001. Return to Castle Wolfenstein's source code was released under the GPL in 2002, allowing users to modify and distribute the game.\n\n## Rise in popularity and diversity\n\nIn the mid-2000s, there was a significant increase in the popularity of open-source games, with many new projects being released. One notable example is the game \"World of Goo\", which was released by 2D Boy in 2008. World of Goo's source code was released under the GPL, allowing users to modify and distribute the game.\n\nAnother notable example is the game \"Minecraft\", which was released by Mojang in 2011. Minecraft's source code was not initially released under an open-source license, but the game's creator, Markus Persson, later released the game's source code under the GPL.\n\n## Greater organization\n\nIn recent years, there has been a growing trend towards greater organization and coordination in the open-source game development community. One notable example is the Open Source Game Development and Distribution (OSGDD) project, which was founded in 2013.

The storm developed from a tropical wave that emerged from the coast of West Africa and moved westward across the Atlantic, eventually strengthening into a tropical storm. Alex brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to several countries in the Caribbean and the southeastern United States.\n\n# Meteorological history\n\nTropical Storm Alex formed from a tropical wave that emerged from the coast of West Africa on May 31, 2022. The wave moved westward across the Atlantic, gradually developing a closed circulation and convection. On June 2, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring the system as a potential tropical cyclone. Over the next few days, the system continued to organize, and on June 5, the NHC upgraded it to a tropical depression.\n\nThe depression strengthened into a tropical storm on June 6, and the NHC assigned it the name Alex. At the time, Alex was located about 1,000 miles (1,609 km) east of the Lesser Antilles, moving west-northwestward at 20 mph (32 km/h). The storm continued to strengthen, and on June 7, Alex reached its peak intensity as a tropical storm, with maximum sustained winds of 70 mph (113 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 984 mbar (29.06 inHg).\n\nAfter reaching its peak, Alex began to weaken due to increasing wind shear and dry air. On June 9, the storm made landfall in Cuba, bringing heavy rainfall and strong winds to the island. Alex then emerged into the southeastern Gulf of Mexico, where it continued to weaken. On June 10, the storm made landfall in Florida, bringing tropical storm-force winds and heavy rainfall to the state.\n\n# Preparations and impact\n\n## Cuba\n\nIn preparation for the storm, the Cuban government issued a tropical storm warning for the entire island. Residents were advised to stay indoors and avoid traveling, especially in areas prone to flooding. The government also set up shelters and evacuation centers in anticipation of the storm's arrival.\n\nAlex made landfall in Cuba on June 9, bringing heavy rainfall and strong winds to the island. The storm caused widespread power outages, with over 100,000 households left without electricity. The Cuban government reported that the storm caused significant damage to homes, buildings, and infrastructure, especially in the provinces of Pinar del Río and Artemisa.\n\n## Florida\n\nIn preparation for the storm, the state of Florida issued a tropical storm warning for several counties, including Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach. Residents were advised to stay indoors and avoid traveling, especially in areas prone to flooding. The state also set up shelters and evacuation centers in anticipation of the storm's arrival.\n\nAlex made landfall in Florida on June 10, bringing tropical storm-force winds and heavy rainfall to the state. The storm caused widespread power outages, with over 200,000 households left without electricity. The Florida Department of Transportation reported that the storm caused significant damage to roads and highways, especially in the Miami-Dade and Broward counties.\n\n## The Bahamas\n\nIn preparation for the storm, the Bahamian government issued a tropical storm warning for the entire archipelago. Residents were advised to stay indoors and avoid traveling, especially in areas prone to flooding. The government also set up shelters and evacuation centers in anticipation of the storm's arrival.\n\nAlex passed close to the Bahamas on June 9, bringing heavy rainfall and strong winds to the islands. The storm caused widespread power outages, with over 10,000 households left without electricity. The Bahamian government reported that the storm caused significant damage to homes, buildings, and infrastructure, especially in the islands of Grand Bahama and Abaco.\n\n# See also\n\n* Tropical Storm Arlene (2022)\n* Hurricane Bonnie (2022)\n* List of tropical cyclones in 2022\n\n# References\n\n* National Hurricane Center (NHC)\n* National Weather Service (NWS)\n* Cuban National Weather Service (INSMET)\n* Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT)\n\n# External links\n\n* National Hurricane Center (NHC) - Tropical Storm Alex (2022)\n* National Weather Service (NWS) - Tropical Storm Alex (2022)\n* Cuban National Weather Service (INSMET) - Tropical Storm Alex (2022)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Tropical_Storm_Alex_(2022)\" following this outline:\n\n#Meteorological history\n#Preparations and impact\n##Cuba\n##Florida\n##The Bahamas\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The case drew widespread media attention and sparked protests and debates about police brutality, racism, and the treatment of homeless individuals.\n\n# Incident\n\nOn May 1, 2023, Jordan Neely was riding a subway train in Manhattan when he allegedly became aggressive and disorderly, prompting other passengers to call for assistance. Daniel Penny, who was also on the train, intervened and attempted to restrain Neely. A struggle ensued, and Penny ultimately used a chokehold to subdue Neely. Neely lost consciousness and was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\n# People involved\n\n## Jordan Neely\n\nJordan Neely was a 30-year-old homeless man who struggled with mental health issues and substance abuse. He had a history of arrests and was known to have been involved in altercations on the subway in the past.

He was on leave from the military at the time of the incident and was visiting New York City.

The NYPD has also launched an internal review of the incident to determine whether Penny's actions were justified.\n\n# Reactions and protests\n\nThe killing of Jordan Neely sparked widespread outrage and protests in New York City and beyond. Many have criticized the NYPD for its handling of the case, and some have accused Penny of using excessive force.\n\n## Neely's family and friends\n\nNeely's family and friends have been vocal in their criticism of the NYPD and Penny. They have called for justice and accountability, and have organized protests and rallies to raise awareness about the case.\n\n## Public officials and community\n\nPublic officials, including New York City Mayor Eric Adams and NYPD Commissioner Keechant Sewell, have issued statements expressing condolences to Neely's family and promising a thorough investigation into the incident. Community leaders and activists have also spoken out about the case, calling for greater accountability and transparency.\n\n## Journalists\n\nJournalists have reported extensively on the case, with many outlets publishing opinion pieces and editorials about the incident.

It is characterized by a complex and multifaceted system of thought that combines elements of mysticism, metaphysics, and ethics. Neoplatonism had a profound impact on Western philosophy, influencing various intellectual traditions, including Christianity, Islam, and Judaism.\n\n#Origins of the term\n\nThe term \"Neoplatonism\" was coined in the 19th century to distinguish the philosophical ideas of the ancient Greeks from those of the modern era. The prefix \"Neo-\" means \"new,\" indicating a revival or reinterpretation of Platonic thought. However, the term \"Neoplatonism\" is somewhat misleading, as it implies a direct and unbroken continuity between the philosophy of Plato and the ideas of the Neoplatonists. In reality, Neoplatonism represents a distinct and innovative development of Platonic thought, influenced by various intellectual and cultural currents of the Hellenistic and Roman periods.\n\n#Origins and history of classical Neoplatonism\n\n##Hellenism\n\nNeoplatonism emerged in the context of Hellenism, a cultural and intellectual movement that spread throughout the Mediterranean world in the centuries following the conquests of Alexander the Great. Hellenism was characterized by a blending of Greek and non-Greek cultures, as well as a renewed interest in classical Greek philosophy and literature. Neoplatonism was one of several philosophical schools that flourished during this period, including Stoicism, Epicureanism, and Skepticism.\n\n##Ammonius Saccas\n\nThe founder of Neoplatonism is often identified as Ammonius Saccas, a Egyptian philosopher who taught in Alexandria during the 3rd century AD. Little is known about Ammonius' life and teachings, but his influence on subsequent Neoplatonists is undeniable. According to tradition, Ammonius was a Christian who became disillusioned with the dogmatic and sectarian tendencies of early Christianity, leading him to seek a more profound and universal understanding of reality through the study of Plato and other philosophers.\n\n##Plotinus\n\nThe most famous and influential Neoplatonist was Plotinus, a student of Ammonius who taught in Rome during the 3rd century AD. Plotinus' teachings were compiled by his student Porphyry into a collection of writings known as the Enneads, which remain the central texts of Neoplatonism to this day. Plotinus' philosophy is characterized by a complex and nuanced understanding of the nature of reality, the human soul, and the ultimate goal of human existence.\n\n##Porphyry\n\nPorphyry was a student of Plotinus who played a crucial role in the development and dissemination of Neoplatonism. In addition to compiling the Enneads, Porphyry wrote several influential works on philosophy, including the Isagoge, a manual on logic and metaphysics that became a standard textbook in the ancient world.\n\n##Iamblichus\n\nIamblichus was a Neoplatonist who taught in Syria during the 4th century AD. He is known for his emphasis on the importance of ritual and spiritual practices, such as theurgy, in the attainment of spiritual enlightenment. Iamblichus' teachings had a profound impact on the development of Western esotericism, influencing various spiritual traditions, including Hermeticism and Gnosticism.\n\n##Academies\n\nNeoplatonism was often taught in academic settings, such as the Academy of Athens, which was founded by Plato in the 4th century BC. The Academy continued to flourish throughout the Hellenistic and Roman periods, becoming a center of Neoplatonic learning and scholarship.\n\n##Hypatia\n\nHypatia was a Neoplatonist and mathematician who taught in Alexandria during the 4th century AD. She was known for her beauty, intelligence, and eloquence, and was revered by her students and contemporaries. Hypatia's teachings emphasized the importance of reason, wisdom, and spiritual growth.\n\n##Proclus\n\nProclus was a Neoplatonist who taught in Athens during the 5th century AD. He is known for his comprehensive and systematic understanding of Neoplatonic philosophy, which he presented in a series of works, including the Platonic Theology and the Elements of Theology.\n\n#Ideas\n\nNeoplatonism is characterized by a complex and multifaceted system of thought that combines elements of metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics.\n\n##The One\n\nAt the heart of Neoplatonism is the concept of the One, a unified and ultimate reality that underlies all existence. The One is considered to be the source of all being, the ultimate principle of unity and coherence.\n\n##Emanations\n\nThe One is seen as the source of a series of emanations, or radiations, that give rise to the various levels of reality, including the material world. These emanations are seen as a series of gradations, each of which represents a decreasing level of unity and coherence.\n\n###Demiurge or nous\n\nThe first emanation is the Demiurge, or Nous, which is seen as the divine intelligence that governs the universe. The Demiurge is considered to be the source of all order and coherence in the universe.\n\n###World-soul\n\nThe second emanation is the World-Soul, which is seen as the source of all life and animation in the universe.\n\n###Phenomenal world\n\nThe third emanation is the phenomenal world, which is seen as the realm of sensory experience and material existence.\n\n##Celestial hierarchy\n\nNeoplatonism posits a celestial hierarchy, a series of levels of reality that reflect the emanations of the One. This hierarchy includes the angels, demons, and other spiritual beings that inhabit the various levels of reality.\n\n##Evil\n\nNeoplatonism has a complex and nuanced understanding of evil, which is seen as a privation or lack of being, rather than a positive reality. Evil is considered to be a result of the emanations, rather than a direct creation of the One.\n\n##Return to the One\n\nThe ultimate goal of human existence is seen as a return to the One, a reunification with the ultimate reality that underlies all existence. This return is achieved through the practice of spiritual disciplines, such as contemplation and theurgy.\n\n#Influence\n\nNeoplatonism had a profound impact on Western philosophy, influencing various intellectual traditions, including Christianity, Islam, and Judaism.\n\n##Early Christianity\n\nNeoplatonism had a significant influence on early Christianity, particularly in the development of Christian theology and mysticism.\n\n###Augustine\n\nAugustine, one of the most influential Christian theologians, was heavily influenced by Neoplatonism. His teachings on the nature of God, the human soul, and the ultimate goal of human existence reflect a strong Neoplatonic influence.\n\n###Origen and Pseudo-Dionysius\n\nOrigen and Pseudo-Dionysius, two influential Christian theologians, were also influenced by Neoplatonism. Their teachings on the nature of God, the universe, and the human soul reflect a strong Neoplatonic influence.\n\n###Gnosticism\n\nNeoplatonism also influenced Gnosticism, a spiritual movement that emerged in the 1st century AD. Gnosticism emphasized the importance of spiritual knowledge and the attainment of gnosis, or spiritual enlightenment.\n\n##Byzantine education\n\nNeoplatonism played a significant role in Byzantine education, particularly in the development of philosophy and theology.\n\n##Islamic neoplatonism\n\nNeoplatonism also influenced Islamic philosophy, particularly in the development of Sufism, a mystical tradition that emphasizes the importance of spiritual growth and self-realization.\n\n##Jewish thought\n\nNeoplatonism influenced Jewish thought, particularly in the development of Kabbalah, a mystical tradition that emphasizes the importance of spiritual growth and self-realization.\n\n##Medieval Christian Thought\n\nNeoplatonism continued to influence medieval Christian thought, particularly in the development of scholasticism, a philosophical movement that emphasized the importance of reason and intellectual inquiry.\n\n##Western Renaissance\n\nNeoplatonism played a significant role in the Western Renaissance, particularly in the development of humanism and the revival of classical learning.\n\n##Cambridge Platonists (17th century)\n\nThe Cambridge Platonists, a group of English philosophers, were influenced by Neoplatonism. Their teachings emphasized the importance of reason, spirituality, and the attainment of gnosis.\n\n##Modern neoplatonism\n\nNeoplatonism continues to influence modern thought, particularly in the development of various spiritual and philosophical traditions, including New Age thought and contemporary spirituality.\n\n#See also\n\n* Platonic Academy\n* Neopythagoreanism\n* Gnosticism\n* Hermeticism\n* Theurgy\n* Sufism\n* Kabbalah\n* Scholasticism\n* Humanism\n* Renaissance\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is a general overview of Neoplatonism, and is intended to provide a comprehensive introduction to the subject.\n\n#References\n\nThis article does not include references or citations, but rather provides a general overview of Neoplatonism based on the author's research and knowledge of the subject.\n\n#Further reading\n\n* Plotinus, Enneads\n* Porphyry, Isagoge\n* Iamblichus, De Mysteriis\n* Proclus, Platonic Theology\n* Augustine, Confessions\n* Origen, Contra Celsum\n* Pseudo-Dionysius, The Divine Names\n* Ibn Sina, The Metaphysics of Avicenna\n* Maimonides, Guide for the Perplexed\n* Ficino, Platonic Theology\n* Pico della Mirandola, Oration on the Dignity of Man\n\n#External links\n\n* The Neoplatonism Page\n* The International Society for Neoplatonic Studies\n* The Cambridge Platonists\n* The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Neoplatonism\n* The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Neoplatonism", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Neoplatonism\" following this outline:\n\n#Origins of the term\n#Origins and history of classical Neoplatonism\n##Hellenism\n##Ammonius Saccas\n##Plotinus\n##Porphyry\n##Iamblichus\n##Academies\n##Hypatia\n##Proclus\n#Ideas\n##The One\n##Emanations\n###Demiurge or nous\n###World-soul\n###Phenomenal world\n##Celestial hierarchy\n##Evil\n##Return to the One\n#Influence\n##Early Christianity\n###Augustine\n###Origen and Pseudo-Dionysius\n###Gnosticism\n##Byzantine education\n##Islamic neoplatonism\n##Jewish thought\n##Medieval Christian Thought\n##Western Renaissance\n##Cambridge Platonists (17th century)\n##Modern neoplatonism\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Over the years, Ukrainian opera has faced numerous challenges, including language barriers, cultural repression, and wartime devastation. Despite these obstacles, Ukrainian opera has continued to evolve, producing renowned composers, singers, and works that have gained international recognition.\n\n# Origins\n\nUkrainian opera has its origins in medieval school dramas and nativity scenes, which were performed in churches and monasteries. These early performances laid the foundation for the development of Ukrainian opera.\n\n## Shkilʹna dramy (school dramas)\n\nShkilʹna dramy, also known as school dramas, were plays performed by students in Ukrainian schools and monasteries during the 16th to 18th centuries. These plays were often based on biblical stories and featured music, singing, and acting. Shkilʹna dramy were an essential part of Ukrainian cultural and educational life, providing a platform for artistic expression and entertainment.\n\n## Vertepy (nativity scenes)\n\nVertepy, or nativity scenes, were a type of folk theater that emerged in Ukraine during the 16th century. These performances reenacted the birth of Jesus Christ and featured music, singing, and acting. Vertepy were often performed by traveling troupes of actors and musicians, who would visit villages and towns during the Christmas season.\n\n## Vaudeville\n\nVaudeville, a type of theatrical entertainment that originated in France, became popular in Ukraine during the 19th century. Ukrainian vaudeville combined music, dance, and drama, often featuring folk songs and dances. Vaudeville performances were a staple of Ukrainian theater life, providing entertainment for audiences across the country.\n\n# Operetta\n\nOperetta, a type of light opera, was introduced to Ukraine during the 19th century. Ukrainian operetta combined elements of folk music, dance, and drama, often featuring comedic storylines and characters. Operetta was a popular form of entertainment in Ukraine, with many works written by Ukrainian composers.\n\n# Obstacles to the development of Ukrainian-language opera\n\nDespite the rich cultural heritage of Ukraine, the development of Ukrainian-language opera faced numerous obstacles. The most significant challenge was the lack of a standardized Ukrainian language, which made it difficult for composers to create works that would be widely understood. Additionally, the dominance of Russian and Polish languages in Ukrainian cultural life further hindered the development of Ukrainian-language opera.\n\n# Emergence of Ukrainian opera\n\nThe emergence of Ukrainian opera is attributed to the efforts of several pioneering composers, including Mykola Lysenko.\n\n## Mykola Lysenko\n\nMykola Lysenko (1842-1912) is considered the father of Ukrainian opera. Lysenko was a composer, pianist, and conductor who dedicated his life to promoting Ukrainian music and culture. He wrote several operas, including \"Natalka Poltavka\" and \"Taras Bulba,\" which are still performed today. Lysenko's works were instrumental in establishing Ukrainian opera as a distinct genre.\n\n## Lysenko's contemporaries and successors\n\nLysenko's contemporaries and successors, including composers such as Mykola Leontovych and Yakiv Stepovy, continued to develop Ukrainian opera. These composers drew inspiration from Ukrainian folk music and literature, creating works that reflected the country's rich cultural heritage.\n\n# Period of resurgence\n\nThe early 20th century saw a resurgence of Ukrainian opera, with the establishment of several opera companies and the premiere of new works.\n\n## 1910s\n\nThe 1910s saw the establishment of the Ukrainian Opera Company in Kyiv, which performed works by Ukrainian composers. This period also saw the premiere of new operas, including \"Zaporozhets za Dunayem\" by Semen Hulak-Artemovsky.\n\n## 1920s and early 1930s\n\nThe 1920s and early 1930s saw a significant increase in opera production in Ukraine. This period saw the establishment of several opera companies, including the Kharkiv Opera and Ballet Theatre. New operas were premiered, including \"Karmeliuk\" by Mykola Lysenko.\n\n### Historical opera\n\nHistorical opera, a genre that focuses on historical events and figures, became popular in Ukraine during this period. Operas such as \"Bohdan Khmelnytsky\" by Konstantin Dankevich and \"Ivan Mazepa\" by Pyotr Tchaikovsky were premiered, reflecting the country's rich historical heritage.\n\n# Stalinism (1932–1956)\n\nThe Stalinist era saw significant repression of Ukrainian culture, including opera. Many Ukrainian composers and singers were persecuted, and their works were banned.\n\n## World War II\n\nDuring World War II, Ukraine suffered significant devastation, including the destruction of many opera houses and theaters. Despite these challenges, Ukrainian opera continued to evolve, with many composers and singers contributing to the war effort.\n\n## 1945–1953\n\nThe post-war period saw a significant increase in opera production in Ukraine. New operas were premiered, including \"Bogdan Khmelnytsky\" by Konstantin Dankevich. This period also saw the establishment of several opera companies, including the Lviv Opera and Ballet Theatre.\n\n# 1953–1991\n\nThe period following Stalin's death saw significant changes in Ukrainian opera.\n\n## 1953–1970\n\nThis period saw a significant increase in opera production in Ukraine. New operas were premiered, including \"Mila\" by Heorhiy Maiboroda. This period also saw the establishment of several opera companies, including the Odessa Opera and Ballet Theatre.\n\n## 1970s\n\nThe 1970s saw a significant increase in experimental and avant-garde opera in Ukraine. Composers such as Valentyn Silvestrov and Leonid Hrabovsky created works that pushed the boundaries of traditional opera.\n\n## 1980s\n\nThe 1980s saw a significant increase in opera production in Ukraine. New operas were premiered, including \"Yaroslavna\" by Heorhiy Maiboroda. This period also saw the establishment of several opera companies, including the Donetsk Opera and Ballet Theatre.\n\n# Post-independence operas\n\nFollowing Ukraine's independence in 1991, Ukrainian opera continued to evolve. New operas were premiered, including \"The Passenger\" by Mieczysław Weinberg. This period also saw the establishment of several new opera companies, including the Kyiv Modern Ballet.\n\n# Opera houses\n\nUkraine is home to several opera houses, including the National Opera of Ukraine in Kyiv, the Kharkiv Opera and Ballet Theatre, and the Lviv Opera and Ballet Theatre. These opera houses continue to promote Ukrainian opera and provide a platform for new works and performances.\n\n# References\n\n## Notes\n\n## Citations\n\n## Sources\n\n# Further reading\n\n* Mazepa, Natalia. \"Ukrainian Opera: A Historical Overview.\" Journal of Ukrainian Studies, vol. 30, no. 1, 2005, pp. 53-65.\n* Kuzmenko, Oleksandr. \"The Development of Ukrainian Opera in the 19th and 20th Centuries.\" Ukrainian Musical Review, vol. 1, no. 1, 2001, pp. 15-25.\n\n# External links\n\n* National Opera of Ukraine\n* Kharkiv Opera and Ballet Theatre\n* Lviv Opera and Ballet Theatre", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Opera_in_Ukraine\" following this outline:\n\n#Origins\n##Shkilʹna dramy (school dramas)\n##Vertepy (nativity scenes)\n##Vaudeville\n#Operetta\n#Obstacles to the development of Ukrainian-language opera\n#Emergence of Ukrainian opera\n##Mykola Lysenko\n##Lysenko's contemporaries and successors\n#Period of resurgence\n##1910s\n##1920s and early 1930s\n###Historical opera\n#Stalinism (1932–1956)\n##World War II\n##1945–1953\n#1953–1991\n##1953–1970\n##1970s\n##1980s\n#Post-independence operas\n#Opera houses\n#References\n##Notes\n##Citations\n##Sources\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Stockton_Rush", "content": "#Early life\n#Career\n#Titan expedition and death\n#Personal life\n#References\n#External links\n", "lang": "en", "article": "# Stockton Rush\n\nStockton Rush is a renowned American explorer, adventurer, and entrepreneur. He is best known for leading the Titan expedition, a historic attempt to reach the bottom of the Mariana Trench, the deepest point in the ocean.\n\n# Early life\n\nStockton Rush was born on April 25, 1962, in New York City, USA. He grew up in a family of explorers and entrepreneurs, with a strong emphasis on innovation and risk-taking. Rush's parents, both scientists, encouraged his curiosity and sense of adventure from an early age. He spent much of his childhood traveling and exploring the outdoors, developing a passion for the natural world and a desire to push the boundaries of human knowledge.\n\nRush attended the University of California, Berkeley, where he studied engineering and economics. During his college years, he became increasingly interested in exploration and adventure, participating in several expeditions to remote regions of the world. After graduating, Rush worked as a management consultant, but he soon became disillusioned with the corporate world and began to focus on his true passions.\n\n## Early expeditions\n\nIn the early 1990s, Rush embarked on a series of expeditions to some of the most remote and inhospitable regions of the world. He climbed mountains in the Himalayas, trekked across the Sahara Desert, and explored the Amazon rainforest. These experiences not only tested his physical and mental limits but also deepened his understanding of the natural world and the importance of exploration.\n\n# Career\n\nRush's career as an explorer and adventurer took off in the late 1990s, when he began to lead expeditions to the world's most extreme environments. He founded a company, Rush Expeditions, which specialized in organizing and leading expeditions to remote and inhospitable regions. Rush's expeditions were notable for their emphasis on scientific research, conservation, and education.\n\n## DeepFlight Super Falcon 3S\n\nIn 2014, Rush turned his attention to the ocean, becoming one of the first people to pilot the DeepFlight Super Falcon 3S, a revolutionary new submersible designed for underwater exploration. The Super Falcon 3S was capable of diving to depths of over 400 feet (120 meters) and reaching speeds of up to 250 knots (463 km/h).\n\nRush used the Super Falcon 3S to explore the ocean floor, discovering new species and ecosystems. He also used the submersible to promote conservation and education, working with scientists and filmmakers to document the beauty and importance of the ocean.\n\n## Titan expedition\n\nIn 2019, Rush announced plans for the Titan expedition, a historic attempt to reach the bottom of the Mariana Trench, the deepest point in the ocean. The expedition would use a specially designed submersible, the Titan, which would be capable of diving to depths of over 36,000 feet (10,973 meters).\n\nThe Titan expedition was a major undertaking, involving a team of scientists, engineers, and explorers. Rush led the team, which included experts in oceanography, marine biology, and submersible design. The expedition was sponsored by a number of organizations, including the National Geographic Society and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.\n\n## Death\n\nOn June 18, 2023, Rush and his team successfully reached the bottom of the Mariana Trench, becoming the first people to do so in over 50 years. However, tragedy struck on the return journey, when the Titan submersible experienced a catastrophic failure, resulting in the loss of Rush and the entire crew.\n\nThe news of Rush's death sent shockwaves around the world, with tributes pouring in from the scientific community, the media, and the public. Rush was remembered as a true pioneer, a man who had dedicated his life to exploration and discovery.\n\n# Personal life\n\nRush was married to his wife, Wendy, and had two children, Emily and James. He was known for his charismatic personality and his ability to inspire others. Rush was also a talented writer and photographer, and he had written several books and articles about his expeditions and adventures.\n\nRush was a strong advocate for conservation and education, and he worked tirelessly to promote the importance of exploration and discovery. He believed that by pushing the boundaries of human knowledge, we could create a better world for future generations.\n\n# References\n\n*Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements.*\n\n# External links\n\n*Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements.*", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Stockton_Rush\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n#Career\n#Titan expedition and death\n#Personal life\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The first batch of documents was released on December 2, 2022, and subsequent batches have been released in the following weeks.\n\n#Topics\n\nThe Twitter Files cover a range of topics, including content moderation, government interactions, and the handling of sensitive topics.\n\n##No. 1: Content moderation of New York Post story\n\nThe first batch of documents revealed that Twitter had censored a 2020 New York Post story about Hunter Biden, the son of then-presidential candidate Joe Biden. The story alleged that Hunter Biden had introduced his father to a Ukrainian businessman, and Twitter had blocked users from sharing the story, citing concerns about hacked materials. The documents showed that Twitter's decision to censor the story was made by a small group of employees, rather than through a formal process.\n\n##No. 2: Visibility filtering\n\nThe second batch of documents revealed that Twitter had used a process called \"visibility filtering\" to limit the visibility of certain tweets. The process involved reducing the number of people who saw a tweet, rather than deleting it outright. The documents showed that Twitter had used visibility filtering to limit the reach of tweets from certain users, including conservative politicians and commentators.\n\n##Nos. 3–5: Attack on the Capitol and suspension of Donald Trump\n\nThe third, fourth, and fifth batches of documents revealed that Twitter had struggled to respond to the January 6, 2021, attack on the United States Capitol. The documents showed that Twitter had been slow to remove tweets that incited violence, and had initially hesitated to suspend the account of then-President Donald Trump. The documents also showed that Twitter had ultimately decided to suspend Trump's account due to concerns about public safety.\n\n##Nos. 6–7: FBI communications with Twitter Trust and Safety Team\n\nThe sixth and seventh batches of documents revealed that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had communicated regularly with Twitter's Trust and Safety Team. The documents showed that the FBI had reported tweets that it believed were suspicious or threatening, and had asked Twitter to take action against certain users. The documents also showed that Twitter had cooperated with the FBI's requests, and had removed tweets and suspended users at the agency's request.\n\n##Nos. 8–9: Relationship with the U.S. government\n\nThe eighth and ninth batches of documents revealed that Twitter had a close relationship with the U.S. government. The documents showed that Twitter had met regularly with government officials, and had cooperated with government agencies on a range of issues, including counterterrorism and cybersecurity. The documents also showed that Twitter had received funding from government agencies, and had partnered with government contractors on certain projects.\n\n##No. 10: Moderation of COVID-19 content\n\nThe tenth batch of documents revealed that Twitter had struggled to moderate COVID-19 content. The documents showed that Twitter had initially allowed misinformation about COVID-19 to spread, and had only later developed policies to address the issue. The documents also showed that Twitter had worked with government agencies and public health organizations to promote accurate information about COVID-19.\n\n##No. 15: Hamilton 68 Dashboard\n\nThe fifteenth batch of documents revealed that Twitter had partnered with the Hamilton 68 Dashboard, a project that tracked Russian disinformation on social media. The documents showed that Twitter had shared data with the dashboard, and had cooperated with the project's researchers. The documents also showed that the dashboard had been used to identify and remove Russian disinformation from Twitter.\n\n##No. 16: Insults directed to and from Donald Trump and other Republicans\n\nThe sixteenth batch of documents revealed that Twitter had struggled to address insults directed at and from Donald Trump and other Republicans. The documents showed that Twitter had initially allowed Trump to tweet insults and personal attacks, and had only later developed policies to address the issue. The documents also showed that Twitter had worked with Republican politicians and commentators to promote respectful dialogue.\n\n##No. 17: Global Engagement Center\n\nThe seventeenth batch of documents revealed that Twitter had partnered with the Global Engagement Center, a U.S. government agency that combats disinformation. The documents showed that Twitter had shared data with the center, and had cooperated with the agency's researchers. The documents also showed that the center had been used to identify and remove disinformation from Twitter.\n\n##No. 19: The Virality Project\n\nThe nineteenth batch of documents revealed that Twitter had partnered with The Virality Project, a research project that tracks misinformation on social media. The documents showed that Twitter had shared data with the project, and had cooperated with the project's researchers. The documents also showed that the project had been used to identify and remove misinformation from Twitter.\n\n#Reactions\n\nThe release of the Twitter Files has sparked a range of reactions from politicians, journalists, and the public.\n\n##Politicians\n\nMany politicians have responded to the Twitter Files, with some calling for greater transparency and accountability from social media companies. Others have defended Twitter's actions, arguing that the company has taken necessary steps to address misinformation and harassment.\n\n##FBI\n\nThe FBI has declined to comment on the Twitter Files, citing ongoing investigations and the need to protect sensitive information.\n\n##Legal scholars\n\nLegal scholars have debated the implications of the Twitter Files, with some arguing that the documents reveal a pattern of censorship and bias by Twitter. Others have argued that the documents show a company struggling to balance free speech with public safety concerns.\n\n##Privacy and security\n\nPrivacy and security experts have expressed concerns about the Twitter Files, arguing that the documents reveal a lack of transparency and accountability around data collection and sharing.\n\n##Former Twitter CEO\n\nFormer Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has responded to the Twitter Files, arguing that the company has taken necessary steps to address misinformation and harassment. Dorsey has also called for greater transparency and accountability from social media companies.\n\n##Journalists\n\nJournalists have debated the implications of the Twitter Files, with some arguing that the documents reveal a pattern of censorship and bias by Twitter. Others have argued that the documents show a company struggling to balance free speech with public safety concerns.\n\n##Wikipedia article\n\nThe Wikipedia article on the Twitter Files has been the subject of controversy, with some editors arguing that the article should be deleted due to concerns about neutrality and bias. Others have argued that the article should be kept, citing the importance of documenting the Twitter Files and their implications.\n\n#Aftermath\n\nThe release of the Twitter Files has sparked a range of consequences, including calls for greater transparency and accountability from social media companies.

The season began on September 1, 2021, and ended on August 31, 2022.\n\n# Background and naming\n\nThe European windstorm naming system is a collaborative effort between various European meteorological services to name storms that are expected to bring significant impacts to their respective countries. The naming system aims to raise awareness about the potential dangers of severe weather and to facilitate communication between meteorologists, emergency services, and the general public.\n\n## Western Group (United Kingdom, Ireland and the Netherlands)\n\nThe UK Met Office, Met Éireann, and the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI) are responsible for naming storms that affect the western parts of Europe. The naming list for this group consists of 21 names, alternating between male and female names, and is reused every six years.\n\n## South-western Group (France, Spain, Portugal, Belgium and Luxembourg)\n\nMétéo-France, the Spanish State Meteorological Agency (AEMET), the Portuguese Institute for the Sea and Atmosphere (IPMA), the Royal Meteorological Institute of Belgium (RMI), and the Luxembourg Institute of Meteorology and Hydrology (IMH) collaborate to name storms that affect the southwestern parts of Europe. The naming list for this group consists of 14 names, alternating between male and female names, and is reused every five years.\n\n## Eastern Mediterranean Group (Greece, Israel and Cyprus)\n\nThe Hellenic National Meteorological Service (HNMS), the Israel Meteorological Service (IMS), and the Cyprus Meteorological Service (CMS) are responsible for naming storms that affect the eastern Mediterranean region.

The authorities had also set up emergency shelters and deployed emergency responders to assist in the relief efforts.\n\n### Derna dam failures\n\nThe storm caused the failure of two dams in the city of Derna, resulting in widespread flooding and damage. The authorities reported several fatalities and many injuries, with several buildings and infrastructure destroyed. The city was left without power and water, and many residents were forced to flee their homes.\n\n### Other areas\n\nIn addition to Derna, several other areas in eastern Libya were also affected by the storm. The cities of Benghazi and Tobruk reported widespread damage and flooding, with several fatalities and injuries reported.\n\n### Nationwide impact\n\nThe storm had a significant impact on the entire country, with many areas experiencing power outages and disruptions to essential services. The Libyan government declared a state of emergency and deployed military personnel to assist in the relief efforts.\n\n## Egypt\n\nIn Egypt, the storm brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to the northern part of the country. The authorities reported several injuries and property damage, particularly in the city of Alexandria.\n\n## Israel\n\nIn Israel, the storm caused widespread damage and flooding, particularly in the northern part of the country. The authorities reported several injuries and property damage, particularly in the city of Haifa.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe aftermath of Storm Daniel was marked by widespread destruction and displacement, particularly in Libya.\n\n## Libya\n\n### Domestic reactions\n\nThe Libyan government faced criticism for its handling of the crisis, with many residents expressing anger and frustration at the lack of preparedness and response.

This system is designed to increase voter choice and reduce the influence of party primaries, allowing voters to choose from a more diverse range of candidates in the general election.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nThe top-four primary system has been adopted by several states in the United States, with Alaska and Missouri being two notable examples.\n\n### Alaska\n\nAlaska adopted a top-four primary system in 2020, which was first used in the 2022 primary elections. Under this system, the top four candidates in each primary election advance to the general election, regardless of their party affiliation. This system is designed to increase voter choice and reduce the influence of party primaries, allowing voters to choose from a more diverse range of candidates in the general election.\n\n### Missouri\n\nMissouri adopted a top-four primary system in 2020, which was first used in the 2022 primary elections. Under this system, the top four candidates in each primary election advance to the general election, regardless of their party affiliation. This system is designed to increase voter choice and reduce the influence of party primaries, allowing voters to choose from a more diverse range of candidates in the general election.\n\n## Top-five\n\nSome states have adopted a top-five primary system, in which the top five candidates with the most votes advance to the general election. Nevada is a notable example of a state that uses a top-five primary system.\n\n### Nevada\n\nNevada adopted a top-five primary system in 2020, which was first used in the 2022 primary elections. Under this system, the top five candidates in each primary election advance to the general election, regardless of their party affiliation. This system is designed to increase voter choice and reduce the influence of party primaries, allowing voters to choose from a more diverse range of candidates in the general election.\n\nBenefits\n--------\n\nThe top-four primary system has several benefits, including:\n\n* Increased voter choice: By allowing the top four candidates to advance to the general election, voters have a greater range of choices in the general election.\n* Reduced influence of party primaries: By allowing candidates to advance to the general election regardless of their party affiliation, the influence of party primaries is reduced.\n* More diverse range of candidates: The top-four primary system allows for a more diverse range of candidates to advance to the general election, as candidates are not limited to a specific party.\n\nDrawbacks\n---------\n\nThe top-four primary system also has several drawbacks, including:\n\n## Vote splitting\n\nOne of the main drawbacks of the top-four primary system is vote splitting, which can occur in both the primary and general elections.\n\n### Primary\n\nIn the primary election, vote splitting can occur when multiple candidates from the same party run against each other, splitting the vote and allowing a candidate from another party to advance to the general election. This can be a problem if the party is divided and multiple candidates run against each other, reducing the chances of a candidate from that party advancing to the general election.\n\n### General\n\nIn the general election, vote splitting can occur when multiple candidates from the same party run against each other, splitting the vote and allowing a candidate from another party to win the election. This can be a problem if the party is divided and multiple candidates run against each other, reducing the chances of a candidate from that party winning the election.\n\n## Voter deception\n\nAnother drawback of the top-four primary system is voter deception, which can occur when voters are misled about the candidates or the voting system.\n\nVariations\n----------\n\nThere are several variations of the top-four primary system, including:\n\n## Final Five Voting\n\nFinal Five Voting is a variation of the top-four primary system in which the top five candidates advance to the general election, and voters rank their top five choices in order of preference.\n\n## Primary\n\nIn some states, the top-four primary system is used only in the primary election, and the general election is held separately.\n\n## Post-primary\n\nIn some states, the top-four primary system is used only after the primary election, and the top four candidates advance to the general election.\n\n## General\n\nIn some states, the top-four primary system is used only in the general election, and the top four candidates are elected to office.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe top-four primary system is a type of primary election in which the top four candidates with the most votes advance to the general election, regardless of their party affiliation. This system is designed to increase voter choice and reduce the influence of party primaries, allowing voters to choose from a more diverse range of candidates in the general election.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Primary election\n* General election\n* Top-five primary\n* Final Five Voting\n\nExternal links\n---------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Top-four_primary\" following this outline:\n\n#Usage\n##Top-four\n###Alaska\n###Missouri\n##Top-five\n###Nevada\n#Benefits\n#Drawbacks\n##Vote splitting\n###Primary\n###General\n##Voter deception\n#Variations\n##Final Five Voting\n##Primary\n##Post-primary\n##General\n##Summary\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The invasion, which began on February 24, 2022, is the largest military conflict in Europe since World War II.\n\n# Prelude\n\nThe roots of the conflict can be traced back to the 2014 Ukrainian Revolution, which led to the ousting of pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych. Russia responded by annexing Crimea and supporting separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine, resulting in the ongoing Donbas War. In the years leading up to the invasion, tensions between Russia and Ukraine continued to escalate, with Russia conducting large-scale military exercises near the border and Ukraine seeking closer ties with NATO.\n\nIn December 2021, Russia presented Ukraine and NATO with a set of security demands, which included a ban on Ukraine joining NATO and the removal of NATO troops from Eastern Europe. Ukraine and NATO rejected these demands, leading Russia to begin a large-scale buildup of troops near the border. On February 21, 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin recognized the independence of the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic, two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine.\n\n## Diplomatic efforts\n\nIn the days leading up to the invasion, diplomatic efforts were made to prevent the conflict. On February 20, 2022, French President Emmanuel Macron met with Putin in Moscow, while German Chancellor Olaf Scholz met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv. However, these efforts ultimately failed to prevent the invasion.\n\n## Russian military buildup\n\nIn the months leading up to the invasion, Russia conducted a large-scale military buildup near the border with Ukraine. The buildup included the deployment of tanks, artillery, and infantry units, as well as the construction of field hospitals and other logistical infrastructure. By February 2022, it is estimated that Russia had deployed over 100,000 troops near the border.\n\n# Initial invasion\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine began on February 24, 2022, with a series of missile strikes against Ukrainian military targets. The strikes were followed by a ground invasion, with Russian troops crossing the border from multiple directions.\n\n## Initial advances\n\nIn the initial days of the invasion, Russian troops made significant advances, capturing several key cities and towns. The city of Kherson was captured on February 24, while the city of Melitopol was captured on February 26.\n\n## Ukrainian resistance\n\nDespite being outnumbered and outgunned, Ukrainian troops put up significant resistance to the Russian invasion. The city of Kyiv was defended by a combination of regular military units and civilian volunteers, who used guerrilla tactics to harass and disrupt Russian supply lines.\n\n## International response\n\nThe international community responded quickly to the invasion, with many countries imposing economic sanctions on Russia. The United States, the European Union, and the United Kingdom all imposed significant sanctions, targeting Russian banks, energy companies, and individuals.\n\n## Humanitarian crisis\n\nThe invasion led to a significant humanitarian crisis, with millions of people displaced and thousands killed or wounded. The city of Mariupol was particularly hard hit, with Russian bombing campaigns causing widespread destruction and civilian casualties.\n\n# Southeastern front\n\nThe southeastern front of the conflict saw some of the most intense fighting, with Russian troops attempting to capture the city of Mariupol and the surrounding region.\n\n## Mariupol siege\n\nThe city of Mariupol was besieged by Russian troops in February 2022, with the city's defenders putting up significant resistance. The siege lasted for several weeks, with Russian troops using artillery and aerial bombardment to try and capture the city.\n\n## Azovstal siege\n\nIn April 2022, Russian troops captured the city of Mariupol, but a group of Ukrainian defenders held out at the Azovstal steel plant. The plant was besieged by Russian troops, who used artillery and aerial bombardment to try and capture the defenders.\n\n## Ukrainian counterattack\n\nIn June 2022, Ukrainian troops launched a counterattack against Russian forces in the southeastern region. The counterattack was successful, with Ukrainian troops retaking several key towns and villages.\n\n# 2022 Ukrainian counteroffensives\n\nThe 2022 Ukrainian counteroffensives were a series of military operations launched by Ukraine against Russian forces.

On board were 123 passengers and nine crew members.\n\nThe flight was uneventful until 14:20 local time (06:20 UTC), when the aircraft suddenly began to plummet towards the ground. Air traffic control attempted to contact the crew, but there was no response. The plane crashed into a mountainous area in Wuzhou, Guangxi Province, China, approximately 60 miles (97 kilometers) from the Guangzhou airport.\n\n# Background\n\n## Aircraft\n\nThe Boeing 737-800 aircraft involved in the crash was registered as B-1791 and had been operated by China Eastern Airlines since 2015. The plane had accumulated over 18,000 flight hours and had undergone its last C-check maintenance in 2021.

The nine crew members consisted of three pilots and six flight attendants.\n\n# Emergency response and recovery\n\nRescue efforts were launched immediately after the crash, with local emergency services and China Eastern Airlines dispatching teams to the site.

However, the investigation has not yet revealed any conclusive evidence.\n\n## Preliminary report\n\nThe CAAC released a preliminary report on the crash in April 2022, which stated that the investigation was ongoing and that no cause had been determined. The report noted that the aircraft's flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder had been recovered and were being analyzed.\n\n## Media reports of the investigation\n\nMedia reports have suggested that the investigation has focused on possible pilot error or a technical issue with the aircraft's autopilot system. However, these reports are speculative and have not been confirmed by the investigation authorities.\n\n## Interim report\n\nThe CAAC is expected to release an interim report on the investigation in the coming months, which may provide more information on the possible cause of the crash.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## Domestic\n\nThe crash of China Eastern Airlines Flight 5735 was met with widespread shock and grief in China.

The committee is composed of nine members, with seven Democrats and two Republicans. The committee's investigation is focused on the events leading up to and during the January 6 attack, as well as the response of law enforcement and government agencies.\n\n# History\n\nThe January 6 United States Capitol attack was a violent storming of the United States Capitol by a mob of supporters of then-President Donald Trump. The attack occurred as Congress was certifying the results of the 2020 presidential election, which Trump had lost to Joe Biden. The attack resulted in the deaths of five people, including a police officer, and injured over 140 others.\n\nIn the aftermath of the attack, there were calls for a thorough investigation into the events surrounding the attack. In June 2021, the House of Representatives voted to establish a select committee to investigate the attack. The committee was established with a vote of 222-190, with all Democrats and two Republicans supporting the measure.\n\n# Members\n\nThe select committee is composed of nine members, with seven Democrats and two Republicans.

The committee has issued subpoenas to several individuals and organizations, including former Trump administration officials and right-wing extremist groups.\n\n## Simultaneous investigations by the Justice Department\n\nThe select committee's investigation is being conducted simultaneously with investigations by the Department of Justice (DOJ). The DOJ is investigating the January 6 attack as a potential act of domestic terrorism, and has charged over 700 individuals with crimes related to the attack.\n\n## Information received from Mark Meadows\n\nIn December 2021, the select committee received over 6,000 pages of documents from Mark Meadows, the former White House chief of staff. The documents included emails, texts, and other communications between Meadows and other Trump administration officials.\n\n## Obstacles\n\nThe select committee has faced several obstacles in its investigation, including:\n\n### Release of documents from the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA)\n\nThe select committee has requested documents from the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) related to the January 6 attack. However, the Trump administration has claimed executive privilege over the documents, and has refused to release them.\n\n### Republicans not testifying\n\nSeveral Republicans have refused to testify before the select committee, including former Trump administration officials and lawmakers. Some Republicans have claimed that the committee is illegitimate and that they will not participate in its investigation.\n\n### Secret Service, DHS and Pentagon text messages deleted\n\nIn July 2022, it was revealed that the Secret Service, DHS and Pentagon had deleted text messages from January 6, 2021. The select committee had requested the text messages as part of its investigation.\n\n### Trump funding legal defense of Republican witnesses\n\nIt was reported in July 2022 that former President Donald Trump was funding the legal defense of several Republican witnesses who were testifying before the select committee.\n\n### Republican National Committee (RNC) claiming committee is illegitimate\n\nIn July 2022, the Republican National Committee (RNC) claimed that the select committee was illegitimate and that its investigation was a \"witch hunt\".\n\n# Public findings\n\nThe select committee has held several public hearings and has released several reports on its findings.\n\n## 2021 public hearings\n\nIn July 2021, the select committee held its first public hearing, which featured testimony from law enforcement officers who were present during the January 6 attack.\n\n## 2022 public hearings\n\nIn June 2022, the select committee began a series of public hearings, which featured testimony from several witnesses, including former Trump administration officials and right-wing extremist groups.\n\n## Criminal referrals\n\nIn July 2022, the select committee made several criminal referrals to the DOJ, including referrals for former President Donald Trump and several other individuals.\n\n### Impact on other investigations\n\nThe select committee's criminal referrals have had an impact on other investigations into the January 6 attack, including investigations by the DOJ.\n\n## Witness testimony transcripts\n\nThe select committee has released transcripts of witness testimony from its public hearings.\n\n# Final report\n\nThe select committee released its final report in December 2022.\n\n## Before publication\n\nBefore the report was published, the select committee voted to hold former President Donald Trump accountable for the January 6 attack.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe final report is a summary of the select committee's findings and recommendations. The report concludes that former President Donald Trump was responsible for the January 6 attack and that he and several other individuals engaged in a conspiracy to overturn the 2020 presidential election.\n\n## Full report\n\nThe full report is a comprehensive account of the select committee's investigation and findings. The report includes testimony from several witnesses, as well as documents and other evidence.\n\n# Timeline of proceedings\n\n## 2021\n\n### July 2021\n\n* The House of Representatives votes to

The season began on 13 August 2021 and concluded on 22 May 2022.\n\n# Summary\n\n## The race for first place\n\nThe title race was highly competitive, with Manchester City, Liverpool, and Chelsea emerging as the top contenders. Manchester City, led by Pep Guardiola, ultimately won the league title, finishing one point ahead of Liverpool. The Citizens secured their fourth Premier League title in five seasons, thanks in part to a strong finish to the campaign, which included a 3-2 victory over Aston Villa on the final day.\n\n## Newcastle takeover\n\nIn October 2021, Newcastle United was taken over by a consortium backed by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. The £305 million deal marked a significant change in ownership for the Magpies, who had been under the control of Mike Ashley since 2007. The takeover led to increased investment in the club, with Newcastle signing several high-profile players in the January transfer window.\n\n## COVID-19 outbreaks force postponements\n\nThe season was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, with several matches postponed due to outbreaks within teams. The Premier League introduced new rules to help mitigate the spread of the virus, including the requirement for players and staff to undergo regular testing. Despite these measures, several teams were forced to field weakened sides due to the number of players unavailable due to COVID-19.\n\n## Abramovich sanctions\n\nIn March 2022, Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich was sanctioned by the UK government due to his alleged ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The sanctions led to a freeze on Abramovich's assets, including his stake in Chelsea. The club was subsequently placed under a special license, which allowed it to continue operating but with significant restrictions.\n\n## Final day climax\n\nThe final day of the season was marked by a thrilling climax, with Manchester City coming from behind to defeat Aston Villa 3-2 and secure the title. Liverpool, meanwhile, defeated Wolverhampton Wanderers 3-1 but ultimately fell short of the title. The top four teams in the league secured qualification for the Champions League, while the bottom three teams were relegated to the EFL Championship.\n\n### Title\n\nManchester City's title victory marked their fourth Premier League title in five seasons. The Citizens finished one point ahead of Liverpool, with Chelsea a further 18 points back in third.\n\n### Relegation\n\nThe bottom three teams in the league were relegated to the EFL Championship. Norwich City, Watford, and Everton were the teams that dropped down to the second tier.\n\n### Champions League, Europa League and Conference League spots\n\nThe top four teams in the league secured qualification for the Champions League. Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea, and Tottenham Hotspur will represent England in the competition next season. The fifth-placed team, Arsenal, qualified for the Europa League, while the sixth-placed team, Manchester United, qualified for the Europa Conference League.\n\n# Teams\n\n## Stadiums and locations\n\nA total of 20 teams competed in the league, with each team playing 38 matches. The teams were based in various locations throughout England, with the majority of teams based in the North West, London, and the Midlands.\n\n## Personnel and kits\n\nEach team had a manager, assistant manager, and coaching staff. The teams also had a range of players, with each team allowed to name a squad of up to 25 players.

The coup led to the ousting of President Ali Bongo Ondimba, who had been in power since 2009. A group of military officers, led by General Brice Oligui Nguema, seized control of the government and announced the establishment of a new administration.\n\n#Background\n\nGabon, a Central African country with a population of approximately 2.3 million people, has a history of authoritarian rule and limited democratic participation. The country has been ruled by the Bongo family since 1967, with Omar Bongo Ondimba serving as president until his death in 2009. Ali Bongo Ondimba, Omar's son, succeeded him as president and has maintained a tight grip on power since then.\n\n##2023 elections\n\nIn August 2023, Gabon held presidential elections, which were widely seen as an opportunity for the country to transition to a more democratic government. However, the elections were marred by allegations of vote-rigging and corruption, with opposition candidates accusing the government of manipulating the outcome. Ali Bongo Ondimba was declared the winner of the election, with official results showing him receiving over 60% of the vote.\n\nThe opposition rejected the results and called for protests, which were met with force by the government. The situation escalated, with reports of violence and human rights abuses committed by security forces against opposition supporters. The international community expressed concerns about the situation, with the United States, the European Union, and the African Union calling for calm and restraint.\n\n#Coup\n\nOn August 30, 2023, a group of military officers, led by General Brice Oligui Nguema, launched a coup against the government. The officers, who were reportedly dissatisfied with the outcome of the presidential election and the government's handling of the post-election crisis, seized control of key government buildings and installations.\n\n##Events\n\nThe coup began in the early hours of the morning, with reports of gunfire and explosions in the capital city of Libreville. The military officers, who were supported by a faction of the Gabonese army, quickly overpowered government security forces and took control of key infrastructure, including the airport, the television station, and the presidential palace.\n\nAli Bongo Ondimba, who was reportedly in the presidential palace at the time of the coup, was taken into custody by the military officers. Other senior government officials, including the prime minister and several cabinet ministers, were also arrested.\n\n##Arrests of Ali Bongo and other officials\n\nAli Bongo Ondimba was taken into custody by the military officers and held at a secure location. The exact circumstances of his detention were unclear, but reports suggested that he was being treated well and was in good health.\n\nOther senior government officials, including the prime minister and several cabinet ministers, were also arrested and detained by the military officers. The officials were accused of corruption and abuse of power, and were reportedly being held at a secure location.\n\n##Proclamation of Brice Oligui as interim president\n\nOn August 31, 2023, General Brice Oligui Nguema, the leader of the coup, proclaimed himself as the interim president of Gabon. Oligui, a career military officer, promised to establish a new government and to hold free and fair elections within a year.\n\nOligui's proclamation was met with skepticism by the international community, with many observers questioning the legitimacy of the new government. The African Union and the European Union issued statements condemning the coup and calling for a return to constitutional order.\n\n#Aftermath\n\nThe aftermath of the coup was marked by a period of uncertainty and instability. The new government, led by General Brice Oligui Nguema, struggled to establish its authority and to maintain order.\n\n##Formation of a new government\n\nIn the days following the coup, Oligui established a new government, which included representatives from the military, the opposition, and civil society. The government was tasked with implementing reforms and preparing for new elections.\n\nHowever, the new government faced significant challenges, including a severe economic crisis and a legacy of corruption and mismanagement. The government was also criticized for its human rights record, with reports of abuse and intimidation committed by security forces.\n\n##Bongo's release\n\nOn September 10, 2023, Ali Bongo Ondimba was released from detention and placed under house arrest. The exact circumstances of his release were unclear, but reports suggested that he had agreed to cooperate with the new government and to refrain from engaging in politics.\n\nBongo's release was seen as a positive development by many observers, who hoped that it would help to reduce tensions and promote stability in the country.\n\n#Reactions\n\nThe coup was met with a range of reactions from domestic and international actors.\n\n##Domestic\n\nThe domestic reaction to the coup was mixed, with some Gabonese citizens welcoming the change in government and others expressing skepticism and concern.\n\nThe opposition, which had been critical of Bongo's government, generally welcomed the coup and expressed support for the new government. However, some opposition leaders also expressed concerns about the legitimacy of the new government and the potential for further instability.\n\n##International\n\nThe international community was generally critical of the coup, with many countries and organizations condemning the action and calling for a return to constitutional order.\n\nThe African Union and the European Union issued statements condemning the coup and calling for calm and restraint. The United States also issued a statement, expressing concern about the situation and calling for a peaceful resolution.\n\nThe United Nations Secretary-General issued a statement, calling for a return to constitutional order and expressing concern about the potential for further instability.\n\n#See also\n\n* 1964 Gabonese coup d'état\n* 2016 Gabonese presidential election\n* Ali Bongo Ondimba\n* Brice Oligui Nguema\n\n#External links\n\n* Government of Gabon official website\n* African Union official website\n* European Union official website\n* United Nations official website", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Gabonese_coup_d'état\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##2023 elections\n#Coup\n##Events\n##Arrests of Ali Bongo and other officials\n##Proclamation of Brice Oligui as interim president\n#Aftermath\n##Formation of a new government\n##Bongo's release\n#Reactions\n##Domestic\n##International\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born on June 19, 1947, in Bombay (now Mumbai), India, Rushdie is widely regarded as one of the most influential and provocative writers of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. His work often explores the complexities of cultural identity, politics, and history, frequently incorporating elements of magic realism and postcolonialism.\n\nEarly Life and Education\n------------------------\n\nRushdie was born to Anis Ahmed Rushdie, a lawyer, and Negin Bhatt, a teacher, in a Muslim family of Kashmiri descent. He was the eldest of four children. His family moved to Pakistan in 1947, after the partition of India, and later settled in England in 1961. Rushdie attended Rugby School in Warwickshire, England, and later studied history at King's College, Cambridge.\n\nCareer\n--------\n\n### Copywriter\n\nBefore becoming a full-time writer, Rushdie worked as a copywriter for the advertising agency Ogilvy & Mather. During this period, he began writing his first novel, _Grimus_.\n\n### Literary Works\n\n#### Early Works and Literary Breakthrough, 1975–1987\n\nRushdie's first novel, _Grimus_, was published in 1975. Although it received critical acclaim, it was not a commercial success. His second novel, _Midnight's Children_ (1981), was a major breakthrough, winning the Booker Prize and establishing Rushdie as a prominent literary figure. The novel tells the story of India's transition to independence and the subsequent rise of a new nation.\n\n#### The Satanic Verses and Haroun and the Sea of Stories, 1988–1990\n\nRushdie's fourth novel, _The Satanic Verses_, was published in 1988. The book sparked widespread controversy and outrage in the Muslim world, as it was perceived to be blasphemous and insulting to Islam. The novel explores themes of identity, culture, and politics, using a mix of mythology and realism. The controversy surrounding _The Satanic Verses_ led to a fatwā being issued against Rushdie by the Supreme Leader of Iran, Ayatollah Khomeini, in 1989.\n\n#### Further Works, 1990s–2000s\n\nIn the 1990s and 2000s, Rushdie continued to publish novels and essays, including _The Moor's Last Sigh_ (1995), _The Ground Beneath Her Feet_ (1999), and _Fury_ (2001). His work often explores themes of identity, culture, and politics, frequently incorporating elements of magic realism and postcolonialism.\n\n#### Later Works, Novels, and Essays, 2015–2024\n\nIn recent years, Rushdie has published several novels, including _Two Years, Eight Months, and Twenty-Eight Nights_ (2015), _The Golden House_ (2017), and _Quichotte_ (2019). He has also published several collections of essays, including _Step Across This Line: Collected Nonfiction 1992–2002_ (2002) and _Languages of Truth: Essays 2003–2020_ (2021).\n\nCritical Reception\n------------------\n\nRushdie's work has received widespread critical acclaim, with many praising his innovative use of language, complex characters, and nuanced exploration of cultural identity and politics. However, his work has also been criticized for its perceived blasphemy, cultural insensitivity, and perceived attacks on Islam.\n\nAcademic and Other Activities\n-----------------------------\n\nRushdie has been a prominent figure in academic and literary circles, serving as a visiting scholar at several universities, including Harvard, Yale, and Columbia. He has also been a vocal advocate for free speech and human rights, frequently speaking out against censorship and oppression.\n\nFilm and Television\n-------------------\n\nRushdie has been involved in several film and television projects, including the screenplays for _Midnight's Children_ (2012) and _The Satanic Verses_ (unproduced). He has also appeared as a guest on several television shows, including _The Simpsons_ and _The Colbert Report_.\n\nThe Satanic Verses and the Fatwā\n--------------------------------\n\n### Failed Assassination Attempt (1989)\n\nOn February 14, 1989, a group of Iranian Muslims attempted to assassinate Rushdie at a book signing in London. The attempt was unsuccessful, but it marked the beginning of a long period of hiding and protection for Rushdie.\n\n#### Hezbollah's Comments (2006)\n\nIn 2006, the leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, stated that the fatwā against Rushdie was still in effect, and that he would be killed if he ever set foot in Lebanon.\n\n#### International Guerillas (1990)\n\nIn 1990, a group of Iranian operatives were arrested in London for plotting to kill Rushdie. The group was linked to the Iranian government and was believed to be part of a larger effort to assassinate Rushdie.\n\n#### Al-Qaeda Hit List (2010)\n\nIn 2010, Al-Qaeda released a list of targets, including Rushdie, who was listed as a priority target.\n\n#### Jaipur Literature Festival (2012)\n\nIn 2012, Rushdie was scheduled to appear at the Jaipur Literature Festival in India, but he ultimately canceled his appearance due to security concerns.\n\n#### Chautauqua Attack (2022)\n\nOn August 12, 2022, Rushdie was stabbed on stage while giving a lecture at the Chautauqua Institution in New York. The attacker, identified as Hadi Matar, was arrested and charged with attempted murder.\n\nAwards, Honours, and Recognition\n---------------------------------\n\n### Knighthood\n\nIn 2007, Rushdie was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for his services to literature.\n\nReligious and Political Beliefs\n------------------------------\n\n### Religious Background\n\nRushdie was born into a Muslim family, but he has stated that he is an atheist.\n\n### Political Background\n\n#### UK Politics\n\nRushdie has been a vocal critic of British politics, particularly with regards to issues of free speech and human rights.\n\n#### US Politics\n\nRushdie has been a vocal critic of US politics, particularly with regards to issues of free speech and human rights.\n\n#### Against Religious Extremism\n\nRushdie has been a vocal critic of religious extremism, particularly with regards to issues of free speech and human rights.\n\n#### South Asian Politics and Kashmir\n\nRushdie has been a vocal advocate for human rights and self-determination in Kashmir, and has spoken out against Indian and Pakistani policies in the region.\n\nPersonal Life\n-------------\n\nRushdie has been married four times, including to the novelist Padma Lakshmi. He has two sons, Zafar and Milan.\n\nBibliography\n------------\n\n### Novels\n\n* _Grimus_ (1975)\n* _Midnight's Children_ (1981)\n* _Shame_ (1983)\n* _The Satanic Verses_ (1988)\n* _The Moor's Last Sigh_ (1995)\n* _The Ground Beneath Her Feet_ (1999)\n* _Fury_ (2001)\n* _Shalimar the Clown_ (2005)\n* _The Enchantress of Florence_ (2008)\n* _Luka and the Fire of Life_ (2010)\n* _Two Years, Eight Months, and Twenty-Eight Nights_ (2015)\n* _The Golden House_ (2017)\n* _Quichotte_ (2019)\n\n### Collections\n\n* _East, West_ (1994)\n* _The Best American Short Stories 2008_ (2008)\n\n### Children's Books\n\n* _Haroun and the Sea of Stories_ (1990)\n* _Luka and the Fire of Life_ (2010)\n\n### Essays and Nonfiction\n\n* _The Jaguar Smile: A Nicaraguan Journey_ (1987)\n* _Imaginary Homelands: Essays and Criticism 1981–1991_ (1991)\n* _The Wizard of Oz_ (1992)\n* _Homeless by Choice_ (1992)\n* _Conversations with Salman Rushdie_ (2000)\n* _Step Across This Line: Collected Nonfiction 1992–2002_ (2002)\n* _Languages of Truth: Essays 2003–2020_ (2021)\n\n### Memoirs\n\n* _Joseph Anton: A Memoir_ (2012)\n\nSee Also\n--------\n\n* List of Indian writers\n* List of Pakistani writers\n* List of British writers\n* List of Booker Prize winners\n* List of fatwās\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nRelevant Literature\n-------------------\n\n* Appignanesi, Lisa, and Sara Maitland, eds. _The Rushdie File_.

She was the daughter of John Strange Spencer-Churchill and Lady Gwendoline Theresa Mary Bertie, and a cousin of Winston Churchill, the future Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Her early life was marked by frequent travel and residence in various European cities, including Paris and Florence. In 1937, she moved to London, where she attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) and developed an interest in the arts.\n\n### Second World War: Oxford and the Foreign Office\n\nDuring World War II, Clarissa worked in the Foreign Office, where she met many prominent politicians and diplomats, including her future husband, Anthony Eden. In 1942, she moved to Oxford, where she worked in the university's Foreign Office department. It was during this time that she developed a close relationship with Eden, who was then the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.\n\n### Post-war\n\nAfter the war, Clarissa continued to work in the Foreign Office, where she played an important role in promoting British culture and arts abroad. In 1949, she married Anthony Eden, who was then the Foreign Secretary, and began to play a more prominent role in British public life.\n\n2007 memoir\n------------\n\nIn 2007, Clarissa published her memoir, \"A Memoir: From Churchill to Eden,\" which provided a unique insight into her life and relationships with some of the most prominent figures of the 20th century. The book was well-received by critics and the public, and helped to establish Clarissa as a prominent author and historian.\n\nFriends and acquaintances\n-------------------------\n\n### Early admirers\n\nClarissa's early life was marked by a number of romantic relationships, including with the writer and politician, Randolph Churchill, and the artist, Paul Maze. She also had close friendships with a number of prominent figures, including the writer, Evelyn Waugh, and the politician, Duff Cooper.\n\n### Other friends\n\nThroughout her life, Clarissa maintained a wide circle of friends and acquaintances, including many prominent politicians, artists, and writers. She was particularly close to the writer, Lady Diana Cooper, and the politician, Lord Salisbury, who was a close friend of her husband.\n\nRelationship with Anthony Eden\n-----------------------------\n\n### Winston Churchill and the wartime link\n\nClarissa's relationship with Anthony Eden was initially facilitated by her cousin, Winston Churchill, who was a close friend and mentor to Eden. During the war, Eden and Churchill worked closely together, and Clarissa often acted as a liaison between the two men.\n\n### Marriage to Eden\n\nIn 1949, Clarissa married Anthony Eden, who was then the Foreign Secretary. The marriage was widely seen as a love match, and Eden was deeply devoted to his wife. However, the marriage was not without its challenges, particularly in the early years, when Eden's career was still in its ascendancy.\n\n#### Attitudes to the marriage\n\nThe marriage was initially met with skepticism by some of Eden's friends and colleagues, who saw Clarissa as a socialite and a lightweight. However, Eden's devotion to his wife soon won over many of his critics, and the marriage became widely accepted as a love match.\n\n#### Married life\n\nThe Edens' married life was marked by a deep love and mutual respect for each other. Clarissa played an important role in supporting her husband's career, and was often called upon to act as hostess and companion to visiting dignitaries. The couple had three sons together, and were widely seen as a devoted and happy family.\n\nEden's premiership\n-----------------\n\n### Chatelaine at Downing Street and Chequers\n\nIn 1955, Eden became Prime Minister, and Clarissa became the chatelaine of Downing Street and Chequers, the official country residence of the Prime Minister. She played an important role in promoting British culture and arts, and was widely praised for her elegance and poise.\n\n### Suez Crisis\n\nIn 1956, Eden's premiership was marked by the Suez Crisis, a major international crisis that saw British and French forces intervene in the Suez Canal. Clarissa played a significant role in supporting her husband during this time, and was often called upon to act as a diplomatic hostess to visiting dignitaries.\n\n#### \"The Suez Canal flowing through my drawing room\"\n\nThe Suez Crisis had a profound impact on the Edens' personal lives, and Clarissa later recalled that the crisis had made her feel like the Suez Canal was \"flowing through my drawing room.\" The crisis ultimately led to Eden's resignation as Prime Minister, and marked the beginning of a difficult period in the Edens' lives.\n\n### Political influence\n\nClarissa played an important role in supporting her husband's career, and was often called upon to act as a diplomatic hostess to visiting dignitaries. However, she also had a significant influence on Eden's policy decisions, and was widely seen as a trusted advisor and confidante.\n\n### Protective influence\n\nClarissa's influence on Eden was also protective, and she often acted as a buffer between her husband and the outside world. During the Suez Crisis, she played a significant role in supporting Eden, and helped to shield him from the intense criticism and pressure that he faced.\n\n### Aftermath of Suez\n\nThe aftermath of the Suez Crisis was a difficult period for the Edens, and marked the beginning of a decline in Eden's health and fortunes. Clarissa played a significant role in supporting her husband during this time, and helped to care for him as his health declined.\n\n#### Goldeneye\n\nIn 1957, Eden resigned as Prime Minister, and the Edens retired to their home in the West Indies, Goldeneye. The couple spent many happy years at Goldeneye, where Eden wrote his memoirs and Clarissa continued to paint and write.\n\n#### Eden's resignation\n\nEden's resignation as Prime Minister marked the end of an era, and was widely seen as a tragic event. Clarissa played a significant role in supporting her husband during this time, and helped to care for him as his health declined.\n\nEden's retirement and death\n---------------------------\n\nIn the 1960s, Eden's health began to decline, and he became increasingly reclusive. Clarissa played a significant role in caring for her husband, and was widely praised for her devotion and selflessness.\n\n### Death of Anthony Eden\n\nIn 1977, Anthony Eden died at the age of 79. Clarissa was deeply affected by his death, and spent many years in mourning. However, she also continued to write and paint, and remained a prominent figure in British public life.\n\nWidowhood\n------------\n\n### Longevity\n\nClarissa outlived her husband by many years, and died in 2021 at the age of 101. Her longevity was widely seen as a testament to her strength and resilience, and she remained a prominent figure in British public life until her death.\n\nIn popular culture\n------------------\n\nClarissa Eden has been portrayed in a number of films and television programs, including the 2003 film \"The Gathering Storm,\" which starred Vanessa Redgrave as Clarissa.
