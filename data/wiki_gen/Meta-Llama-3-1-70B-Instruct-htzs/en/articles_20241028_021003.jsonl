The storm was the ninth named storm, the fourth hurricane, and the first major hurricane of the 2022 Atlantic hurricane season. Ian brought widespread flooding, strong winds, and storm surges to several countries and states, leaving a trail of devastation in its wake.\n\n# Meteorological history\n\nIan formed as a tropical wave off the coast of West Africa on September 19, 2022. The system moved westward across the Atlantic, organizing into a tropical depression on September 23. The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Ian on September 24, and further intensified into a hurricane on September 25. Ian rapidly intensified into a major hurricane on September 26, reaching Category 3 strength. The storm continued to strengthen, reaching Category 4 strength on September 27, and eventually Category 5 strength on September 28. Ian reached its peak intensity on September 28, with maximum sustained winds of 160 mph (257 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 941 mbar (27.79 inHg). The storm made landfall in western Cuba on September 27, causing widespread destruction and power outages. Ian then emerged into the Gulf of Mexico, where it restrengthened into a Category 4 hurricane before making landfall in southwestern Florida on September 28. The storm brought catastrophic winds, storm surges, and flooding to the state, particularly in the Fort Myers area. Ian then moved northward, bringing heavy rain and strong winds to the Carolinas before dissipating over Virginia on October 1.\n\n# Preparations\n\n## Caribbean\n\n### Jamaica\n\nJamaica was placed under a tropical storm watch on September 24, as Ian was forecast to pass close to the island. The Jamaican government issued a warning for residents to stock up on food and water, and to prepare for possible power outages. The island's airports and seaports were closed on September 25, and schools were suspended until further notice.\n\n### Cayman Islands\n\nThe Cayman Islands were placed under a hurricane warning on September 25, as Ian was forecast to pass directly over the islands. The government issued a mandatory evacuation order for residents of low-lying areas, and schools and businesses were closed. The islands' airports and seaports were also closed, and a curfew was imposed from 7 pm to 7 am.\n\n### Cuba\n\nCuba was placed under a hurricane warning on September 25, as Ian was forecast to make landfall in western Cuba. The government issued a mandatory evacuation order for residents of low-lying areas, and schools and businesses were closed. The island's airports and seaports were also closed, and a curfew was imposed from 7 pm to 7 am.\n\n## United States\n\n### Florida\n\nFlorida was placed under a state of emergency on September 23, as Ian was forecast to make landfall in the state. The National Guard was activated, and emergency supplies were distributed to residents. Schools and businesses were closed, and a mandatory evacuation order was issued for residents of low-lying areas. The state's airports and seaports were also closed, and a curfew was imposed from 7 pm to 7 am.\n\n### Georgia\n\nGeorgia was placed under a state of emergency on September 25, as Ian was forecast to bring heavy rain and strong winds to the state. The National Guard was activated, and emergency supplies were distributed to residents. Schools and businesses were closed, and a mandatory evacuation order was issued for residents of low-lying areas.\n\n### South Carolina\n\nSouth Carolina was placed under a state of emergency on September 25, as Ian was forecast to bring heavy rain and strong winds to the state. The National Guard was activated, and emergency supplies were distributed to residents. Schools and businesses were closed, and a mandatory evacuation order was issued for residents of low-lying areas.\n\n### Elsewhere\n\nOther states in the southeastern United States, including North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia, were also placed under a state of emergency as Ian was forecast to bring heavy rain and strong winds to the region. Schools and businesses were closed, and emergency supplies were distributed to residents.\n\n## The Bahamas\n\nThe Bahamas were placed under a tropical storm watch on September 25, as Ian was forecast to pass close to the islands. The government issued a warning for residents to stock up on food and water, and to prepare for possible power outages. The islands' airports and seaports were closed on September 26.\n\n# Impact\n\n## Caribbean\n\n### Southern Caribbean and South America\n\nIan brought heavy rain and strong winds to several countries in the southern Caribbean and South America, including Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, and Venezuela. The storm caused widespread flooding and power outages, and several people were reported missing.\n\n### Cayman Islands\n\nIan made landfall in the Cayman Islands on September 26, causing widespread destruction and power outages.

One approach to understanding this phenomenon is through the lens of network theory and diffusion of innovation. This framework views the spread of Christianity as a process of innovation diffusion, where a new idea or technology (in this case, Christianity) is adopted by a population over time. In this article, we will explore the Christianization of the Roman Empire as a diffusion of innovation, examining the characteristics of this process and how it unfolded.\n\n# Network theory and Diffusion of innovation as an approach\n\n## Innovation\n\nIn the context of diffusion of innovation, an innovation is a new idea, product, or technology that is perceived as new by the individual or group adopting it. In the case of the Christianization of the Roman Empire, Christianity was the innovation that was diffusing through the population. Christianity was a new and distinct religious movement that emerged in the 1st century AD, and its spread throughout the Roman Empire was a complex process that involved the adoption of new beliefs, practices, and values.\n\n## Alternative approaches\n\nWhile the diffusion of innovation approach provides a useful framework for understanding the Christianization of the Roman Empire, it is not the only approach that has been used to study this phenomenon. Other approaches, such as the \"top-down\" model, which views the Christianization of the Roman Empire as a process driven by imperial patronage and coercion, or the \"bottom-up\" model, which views it as a process driven by grassroots movements and popular piety, have also been used. However, the diffusion of innovation approach provides a unique perspective on the spread of Christianity, highlighting the role of networks, social influence, and individual decision-making in the adoption of new ideas and practices.\n\n## Failure of diffusion\n\nIt is worth noting that the diffusion of innovation approach also highlights the potential for failure in the adoption of new ideas and practices. In the case of the Christianization of the Roman Empire, there were certainly instances where Christianity failed to gain traction or was actively resisted by certain groups or individuals. Understanding the factors that contributed to these failures can provide valuable insights into the complex and often unpredictable nature of innovation diffusion.\n\n# Five characteristics of diffusion\n\nAccording to the diffusion of innovation approach, the adoption of a new idea or technology is influenced by five key characteristics: relative advantage, compatibility and complexity, trialability, observability, and reinvention. We will examine each of these characteristics in turn, exploring how they contributed to the diffusion of Christianity throughout the Roman Empire.\n\n## Relative advantage\n\nThe relative advantage of an innovation refers to the degree to which it is perceived as offering benefits or advantages over existing ideas or practices. In the case of Christianity, several factors contributed to its relative advantage over traditional Roman paganism.\n\n### Alms\n\nOne key factor was the provision of alms, or charitable support, to the poor and vulnerable. Christianity's emphasis on caring for the poor and marginalized provided a stark contrast to the often-neglectful and exploitative practices of traditional Roman paganism.\n\n### Slavery through the fifth century\n\nAnother factor was the Christian attitude towards slavery. While Christianity did not initially challenge the institution of slavery, it did provide a moral framework for the humane treatment of slaves. This was particularly significant in the context of the Roman Empire, where slavery was widespread and often brutal.\n\n### Geography and a scale free network\n\nThe geography of the Roman Empire also played a role in the relative advantage of Christianity. The empire's extensive network of roads, trade routes, and urban centers facilitated the spread of ideas and practices, including Christianity. Additionally, the scale-free network of Christian communities, which were often connected through personal relationships and epistolary exchanges, allowed for the rapid diffusion of ideas and practices across the empire.\n\n## Compatibility and complexity\n\nThe compatibility and complexity of an innovation refer to the degree to which it is consistent with existing values, beliefs, and practices, and the ease with which it can be understood and adopted. In the case of Christianity, its compatibility with Jewish scripture and tradition provided a significant advantage, as many Jews were already familiar with the stories and themes of the Hebrew Bible.\n\nHowever, Christianity's complexity, particularly in its early years, may have presented a barrier to adoption for some individuals. The early Christian communities were often characterized by intense theological debates and disagreements, which may have been off-putting to outsiders.\n\n## Trialability\n\nThe trialability of an innovation refers to the degree to which it can be experimented with or tested before adoption. In the case of Christianity, the early Christian communities often provided a welcoming and inclusive environment for newcomers, allowing them to experience Christian worship and community before making a commitment to adopt the faith.\n\n### Reinvention\n\nReinvention refers to the degree to which an innovation can be adapted or modified to suit the needs and preferences of individual adopters. In the case of Christianity, the early Christian communities often reinvented or reinterpreted existing Jewish and pagan practices, incorporating them into their own unique forms of worship and ritual.\n\n## Observability\n\nThe observability of an innovation refers to the degree to which its adoption is visible to others. In the case of Christianity, the adoption of Christian practices and rituals was often highly visible, particularly in the context of public worship and community life.\n\n### Innovators of the first century\n\nThe innovators of the first century, including Jesus and the apostles, played a crucial role in the observability of Christianity. Their teachings, miracles, and martyrdoms provided a powerful witness to the truth and power of the Christian faith.\n\n### Early adopters in the first and second centuries\n\nThe early adopters of Christianity, including the apostolic fathers and the early Christian apologists, also played a significant role in the observability of the faith. Their writings, sermons, and debates helped to establish Christianity as a credible and attractive option for many people.\n\n### Third century early majority\n\nBy the third century, Christianity had reached a tipping point, with a significant majority of the population in many parts of the empire identifying as Christian. This early majority played a crucial role in the observability of the faith, as they helped to establish Christianity as a dominant cultural and social force.\n\n#### Sexual morality\n\nOne area where Christianity's observability was particularly significant was in the area of sexual morality. Christianity's emphasis on chastity, monogamy, and marital fidelity provided a stark contrast to the often-permissive and promiscuous practices of traditional Roman paganism.\n\n#### Persecution\n\nThe persecution of Christians, particularly during the reign of Emperor Diocletian, also played a significant role in the observability of the faith. The martyrdoms and sufferings of Christians helped to establish the faith as a powerful and attractive option for many people.\n\n# Constantine as opinion leader\n\nConstantine's conversion to Christianity in 312 AD marked a significant turning point in the history of the Christianization of the Roman Empire. As an opinion leader, Constantine played a crucial role in promoting and establishing Christianity as the dominant faith of the empire.\n\nConstantine's patronage of Christianity, including his support for the Council of Nicaea and his construction of churches and other Christian buildings, helped to establish the faith as a credible and attractive option for many people. Additionally, Constantine's own personal conversion and devotion to Christianity provided a powerful example for others to follow.\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article provides a comprehensive overview of the Christianization of the Roman Empire as a diffusion of innovation. By examining the characteristics of this process, including relative advantage, compatibility and complexity, trialability, observability, and reinvention, we can gain a deeper understanding of how Christianity spread throughout the empire.\n\n# References\n\nThis article does not include references or citations.

The film is a fictionalized account of the life of Marilyn Monroe, played by Ana de Armas, and explores her rise to fame and struggles with mental health, relationships, and the Hollywood industry.\n\n#Plot\n\nThe film is a non-linear narrative that jumps back and forth in time, exploring different periods of Monroe's life. The story begins with Monroe as a young girl, Norma Jeane, who is struggling to cope with her mother's mental illness and her own feelings of abandonment. As she grows older, she becomes increasingly desperate to escape her circumstances and find fame and success as an actress.\n\nThe film follows Monroe's early days as a model and actress, her rise to fame with films like \"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes\" and \"How to Marry a Millionaire,\" and her high-profile marriages to baseball player Joe DiMaggio and playwright Arthur Miller. Along the way, she struggles with the pressures of fame, the objectification of her body, and the constraints of her Hollywood persona.\n\nThroughout the film, Dominik employs a range of unconventional narrative techniques, including dream sequences, hallucinations, and surrealistic imagery. These techniques are used to convey Monroe's inner world and her struggles with mental health, as well as the blurred lines between reality and fantasy in her life.\n\n#Cast\n\n* Ana de Armas as Marilyn Monroe\n* Adrien Brody as Arthur Miller\n* Bobby Cannavale as Joe DiMaggio\n* Xavier Samuel as Cass Chaplin\n* Julianne Nicholson as Gladys Pearl Baker\n* Evan Williams as Edward G. Robinson Jr.\n* Toby Huss as Allan \"Whitey\" Snyder\n* David Corenswet as Monroe's lover\n* Rebecca Wisocky as Yvet\n* Caspar Phillipson as Joe Kennedy\n* Dan Butler as I.E. Shinn\n* Sarah Paxton as Miss Flynn\n* Eric Matheson as Joe Jr.\n\n#Production\n\n##Development and writing\n\nAndrew Dominik had been fascinated by Marilyn Monroe's life and legend for many years before embarking on the project. He was drawn to the idea of exploring the complexities and contradictions of her personality, as well as the ways in which she was both empowered and constrained by her fame.\n\nDominik began working on the screenplay in 2010, using Joyce Carol Oates' novel as a starting point. He conducted extensive research on Monroe's life, reading biographies, watching documentaries, and speaking with people who knew her. He also drew on his own experiences as a filmmaker and his observations of the ways in which women are treated in the entertainment industry.\n\n##Pre-production\n\nIn 2019, it was announced that Ana de Armas had been cast as Marilyn Monroe, and that the film would be produced by Brad Pitt and Dede Gardner's production company, Plan B Entertainment. The film's budget was reportedly around $20 million.\n\n##Casting\n\nAna de Armas was Dominik's first choice for the role of Marilyn Monroe, and she underwent extensive preparation to play the part. She worked with a dialect coach to master Monroe's distinctive voice and accent, and she also studied Monroe's mannerisms and body language.\n\nThe rest of the cast was assembled over the course of several months, with Adrien Brody and Bobby Cannavale signing on to play Arthur Miller and Joe DiMaggio, respectively.\n\n##Filming\n\nPrincipal photography began in August 2019 and lasted for around 12 weeks. The film was shot on location in Los Angeles, New York City, and Louisiana, with a crew of around 100 people.\n\nDominik employed a range of unconventional filming techniques, including the use of long takes, handheld camera work, and natural lighting. He also encouraged his actors to improvise and experiment with their performances.\n\n##Music\n\nThe film's score was composed by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis, who have collaborated with Dominik on several previous projects. The score features a range of instruments, including piano, guitar, and strings, and it incorporates several of Monroe's most famous songs, including \"Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend\" and \"I'm Through with Love.\"\n\n#Release\n\nBlonde premiered at the 2022 Venice Film Festival, where it received a 14-minute standing ovation. It was released in theaters in the United States on September 16, 2022, and it was also made available on Netflix.\n\n#Reception\n\n##Critical response\n\nBlonde received widespread critical acclaim, with many reviewers praising Ana de Armas' performance as Marilyn Monroe. The film holds a 92% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 200 reviews, with an average rating of 8.2/10.\n\n##Industry reception\n\nThe film was also praised by industry professionals, with many filmmakers and actors expressing their admiration for Dominik's direction and the performances of the cast.\n\n##Cast\n\nAna de Armas received widespread critical acclaim for her performance as Marilyn Monroe, with many reviewers praising her nuanced and empathetic portrayal of the actress.\n\n##NC-17 rating\n\nThe film received an NC-17 rating from the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), which sparked controversy and debate among film critics and audiences. Some reviewers felt that the rating was unfair, given the film's artistic and historical significance, while others argued that it was justified by the film's explicit content.\n\n##Criticism about depiction of abortion\n\nSome reviewers criticized the film's depiction of Marilyn Monroe's abortion, which is shown in graphic detail. Some felt that the scene was gratuitous and exploitative, while others argued that it was necessary to convey the trauma and complexity of Monroe's experience.\n\n##Accolades\n\nBlonde received several awards and nominations, including a Golden Globe nomination for Ana de Armas' performance. The film was also named one of the best films of 2022 by several publications, including The New York Times and The Guardian.\n\n#See also\n\n* Marilyn Monroe\n* Joyce Carol Oates\n* Andrew Dominik\n* Ana de Armas\n\n#References\n\n* Blonde (2022) - IMDb\n* Blonde (2022) - Rotten Tomatoes\n* Blonde (2022) - Metacritic\n\n#External links\n\n* Official website\n* Trailer on YouTube", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Blonde_(2022_film)\" following this outline:\n\n#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production\n##Development and writing\n##Pre-production\n##Casting\n##Filming\n##Music\n#Release\n#Reception\n##Critical response\n##Industry reception\n##Cast\n##NC-17 rating\n##Criticism about depiction of abortion\n##Accolades\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

With a unique and interpretive voice, Bennett's renditions of popular standards, show tunes, and jazz songs have become iconic in the music world. His dedication to his craft, innovative approach to music, and passion for art have made him a beloved and respected figure in the entertainment industry.\n\nEarly Life\n==========\n\n### 1926â1943: Family and education\n\nTony Bennett was born on August 3, 1926, in Long Island City, Queens, New York, to grocer John Benedetto and seamstress Anna Suraci Benedetto. He was the eldest of three children, and his family lived in a modest home in the Astoria neighborhood of Queens. Bennett's love for music began at an early age, influenced by his mother's singing and his father's collection of jazz records. He attended P.S. 141 and later the High School of Industrial Arts, where he developed his artistic skills.\n\n### 1944â1950: World War II and after\n\nAt the age of 18, Bennett dropped out of high school to work in a shipyard, but he soon enlisted in the United States Army during the final year of World War II. He served in the 63rd Infantry Division and was stationed in France and Germany, where he sang with the regiment's entertainment unit. After his honorable discharge in 1945, Bennett attended the American Theatre Wing on the GI Bill, where he studied drama and music. He began performing in New York City's Greenwich Village, singing in jazz clubs and piano bars.\n\nCareer\n=======\n\n### 1951â1959: First successes\n\nBennett's big break came in 1951 when he was discovered by Pearl Bailey, who saw him performing at the Village Vanguard. She helped him secure a recording contract with Columbia Records, and his debut single, \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams,\" was released in 1950. However, it was his 1951 single \"Because of You\" that brought him his first major success, topping the charts for 10 weeks. Throughout the 1950s, Bennett released a string of hit singles, including \"Blue Velvet,\" \"Rags to Riches,\" and \"Stranger in Paradise.\"\n\n### 1954â1965: A growing artistry\n\nIn the mid-1950s, Bennett began to develop his unique interpretive style, often taking liberties with the melody and lyrics of popular songs. He worked with arranger and pianist Ralph Sharon, who helped him shape his distinctive sound. Bennett's 1954 album \"Cloud 7\" was his first to feature Sharon's arrangements, and it marked a turning point in his career. He went on to release a series of critically acclaimed albums, including \"The Beat of My Heart\" (1957) and \"In Person!\" (1959).\n\n### 1965â1979: Years of struggle\n\nThe 1960s and 1970s were a challenging period for Bennett, as he struggled to adapt to the changing music landscape. He released a number of albums, including \"The Movie Song Album\" (1966) and \"Get Happy\" (1971), but they failed to achieve the same level of success as his earlier work. Bennett also faced personal struggles, including a divorce and a period of heavy drinking. However, he continued to tour and perform, and he began to explore other creative outlets, including painting.\n\n### 1979â1989: Turnaround\n\nIn 1979, Bennett's son Danny Benedetto took over as his manager, and he helped his father revamp his career. Bennett began to focus on his live performances, and he released a series of successful albums, including \"Tony Bennett/Bill Evans Album\" (1979) and \"When I Fall in Love\" (1986). He also began to explore new musical styles, including jazz and swing.\n\n### 1990â2006: Established career\n\nThe 1990s and 2000s were a period of great success for Bennett, as he released a string of critically acclaimed albums and performed to sold-out crowds around the world. He worked with a range of artists, including k.d. lang, Amy Winehouse, and Lady Gaga, and he won numerous awards, including multiple Grammys. Bennett's 1992 album \"Perfectly Frank\" was a tribute to Frank Sinatra, and it marked a new level of sophistication in his career.\n\n### 2006â2021: Later years and final album\n\nIn the 2000s and 2010s, Bennett continued to tour and record, releasing a series of successful albums, including \"Duets: An American Classic\" (2006) and \"Cheek to Cheek\" (2014). He also became a prominent advocate for arts education, and he launched the Exploring the Arts (ETA) program in 1999. Bennett's final album, \"Love for Sale,\" was released in 2021, when he was 95 years old. It was a collaborative effort with Lady Gaga, and it marked a fitting conclusion to his remarkable career.\n\nArtistry\n=========\n\n### Painting\n\nIn addition to his music, Bennett is also a talented painter. He has been painting since the 1940s, and he has exhibited his work under the pseudonym Anthony Benedetto. Bennett's paintings are primarily landscapes and portraits, and they are characterized by their bold colors and expressive brushstrokes.\n\n### Musical style\n\nBennett's musical style is a unique blend of jazz, swing, and popular music. He is known for his interpretive approach to song, often taking liberties with the melody and lyrics of popular standards. Bennett's voice is warm and expressive, and he has a remarkable ability to convey emotion through his singing.\n\nAwards and Legacy\n================\n\nThroughout his career, Bennett has won numerous awards, including multiple Grammys, Emmys, and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He has been recognized for his contributions to the arts, including his work with the Exploring the Arts (ETA) program. Bennett has also been honored by the Kennedy Center, the Library of Congress, and the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP).\n\nWorks\n=====\n\n### Discography\n\nBennett's discography includes over 70 studio albums, as well as numerous live albums and compilations. Some of his most notable albums include \"Cloud 7\" (1955), \"The Beat of My Heart\" (1957), \"I Left My Heart in San Francisco\" (1956), and \"Duets: An American Classic\" (2006).\n\n### Books\n\nBennett has written several books, including \"What My Heart Has Seen\" (1996), \"The Good Life\" (1998), and \"Tony Bennett in the Studio: A Life of Art and Music\" (2007). He has also been the subject of several biographies and documentaries.\n\nPersonal Life\n=============\n\nBennett has been married three times, to Patricia Beech, Sandra Grant, and Susan Crow. He has four children, and he has been involved in a range of charitable organizations, including the Exploring the Arts (ETA) program and the Tony Bennett Foundation.\n\nPolitics\n=======\n\nBennett has been an outspoken advocate for progressive politics, and he has supported a range of causes, including arts education and social justice. He has been a vocal critic of racism and xenophobia, and he has used his platform to promote tolerance and understanding.\n\nIllness and Death\n================\n\nBennett was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2016, and he has been open about his struggles with the condition. He passed away on July 21, 2023, at the age of 96, surrounded by his family and loved ones.\n\nReferences\n==========\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements.)\n\nBibliography\n============\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements.)\n\nFurther Reading\n==============\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements.)\n\nExternal Links\n==============\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements.)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Tony_Bennett\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n##1926â1943: Family and education\n##1944â1950: World War II and after\n#Career\n##1951â1959: First successes\n##1954â1965: A growing artistry\n##1965â1979: Years of struggle\n##1979â1989: Turnaround\n##1990â2006: Established career\n##2006â2021: Later years and final album\n#Artistry\n##Painting\n##Musical style\n#Awards and legacy\n#Works\n##Discography\n##Books\n#Personal life\n#Politics\n#Illness and death\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

As the party's general secretary from 1930 to 1932, ForiÈ implemented a series of radical policies and tactics that would have far-reaching consequences for the party and the country as a whole.\n\n#Biography\n\n##Early life\n\nÈtefan ForiÈ was born in 1892 in the town of Arad, which was then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. His family was of working-class background, and ForiÈ was drawn to socialist and communist ideas from an early age. He became involved in the labor movement while still a teenager and quickly rose through the ranks of the Socialist Party of Romania.\n\n##PCR outlawing\n\nIn 1921, the Socialist Party of Romania was renamed the Communist Party of Romania (PCR) and affiliated itself with the Communist International (Comintern). However, the PCR was outlawed by the Romanian government in 1924, and many of its leaders were forced into exile or underground. ForiÈ, who had by this time become a key figure in the party, was among those who went into hiding.\n\n##\"Popular front\" tactic\n\nIn the late 1920s, the Comintern began to promote the idea of a \"popular front\" against fascism, which involved forming alliances with other left-wing parties and organizations. ForiÈ was a strong supporter of this tactic and saw it as a way for the PCR to build support and influence in Romania. However, not all members of the party agreed with this approach, and it would eventually lead to a major split.\n\n##Taking over\n\nIn 1930, ForiÈ took over as general secretary of the PCR, following the departure of the previous leader, Vitali Holostenko. ForiÈ quickly set about implementing his own policies and tactics, which included building alliances with other left-wing parties and organizations. However, this approach was not without controversy, and ForiÈ soon found himself facing opposition from within the party.\n\n##Resisting the resistance\n\nOne of the major challenges facing ForiÈ was the opposition from within the party to his \"popular front\" tactic. Many members of the party saw this approach as a betrayal of communist principles and a sell-out to other, more moderate parties. ForiÈ faced resistance from a number of quarters, including from some of his own allies.\n\n##CaransebeÈ conspiracy\n\nIn 1932, ForiÈ was involved in the CaransebeÈ conspiracy, a plot to overthrow the Romanian government and establish a communist regime. However, the plot was discovered, and ForiÈ was forced to flee the country.\n\n##Capture\n\nForiÈ was eventually captured by the Romanian authorities and put on trial. He was found guilty of treason and sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\n##Killing\n\nForiÈ died in 1946, while still in prison. The exact circumstances of his death are unclear, but it is believed that he was killed by his guards.\n\n#Legacy\n\n##Cover-up and rumors\n\nFollowing ForiÈ's death, there were rumors of a cover-up and speculation about the circumstances of his killing. Some believed that he had been murdered by the authorities, while others thought that he may have taken his own life.\n\n##Rehabilitation\n\nIn the years following ForiÈ's death, there was a growing recognition of his importance in the history of the Romanian Communist Party. In 1968, the PCR officially rehabilitated ForiÈ, acknowledging his role in the party's early history and his contribution to the development of communism in Romania.\n\n#Personal life and family\n\nLittle is known about ForiÈ's personal life and family. He was married and had children, but details about his family life are scarce.\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is based on a variety of sources, including historical accounts and biographies of ForiÈ.\n\n#References\n\n(No references are included in this article)\n\n#External links\n\n(No external links are included in this article)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Ètefan_ForiÈ\" following this outline:\n\n#Biography\n##Early life\n##PCR outlawing\n##\"Popular front\" tactic\n##Taking over\n##Resisting the resistance\n##CaransebeÈ conspiracy\n##Capture\n##Killing\n#Legacy\n##Cover-up and rumors\n##Rehabilitation\n#Personal life and family\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

From the earliest indigenous inhabitants to the modern-day metropolis, Sydney has undergone significant transformations, shaped by its strategic location, cultural diversity, and economic growth. This timeline provides a comprehensive overview of the major events, milestones, and developments that have shaped the city's history.\n\n# Pre-Colonial\n\nThe Sydney region has been inhabited by indigenous Australians, known as the Eora people, for at least 30,000 years. The Eora people lived in harmony with the land, relying on the rich natural resources of the harbor, rivers, and surrounding bushlands for their survival. The area that is now Sydney was a significant meeting place for various Aboriginal clans, who gathered for trade, ceremonies, and social events.\n\n# 18thâ19th centuries\n\n## 1770sâ1790s\n\nIn 1770, British explorer Captain James Cook arrived in Botany Bay, marking the beginning of European settlement in Australia. However, it was not until 1788 that the British established a penal colony in Sydney Cove, which was named after Lord Sydney, the British Home Secretary. The colony struggled to survive, with inadequate supplies and harsh conditions leading to the deaths of many convicts and early settlers.\n\nIn 1789, the Second Fleet arrived, bringing more convicts, soldiers, and supplies. The colony began to grow, with the establishment of a government, laws, and infrastructure. The 1790s saw the development of agriculture, with the first farms established in the surrounding areas.\n\n## 1800sâ1840s\n\nDuring the early 19th century, Sydney underwent significant growth and development. The colony became a free settlement in 1821, and the British government began to invest in infrastructure, including the construction of roads, bridges, and public buildings.\n\nThe 1820s saw the arrival of free settlers, who established themselves as merchants, traders, and farmers. The city's economy grew, with the establishment of a banking system, a newspaper, and a range of industries.\n\nIn the 1830s, Sydney became a major commercial center, with the establishment of a port and a railway system. The city's population grew rapidly, with the arrival of immigrants from Britain, Ireland, and other parts of the world.\n\n## 1850sâ1890s\n\nThe mid-19th century saw significant growth and development in Sydney, driven by the gold rushes of the 1850s and the expansion of the railway system. The city became a major cultural center, with the establishment of a range of institutions, including the University of Sydney, the Art Gallery of New South Wales, and the Sydney Opera House.\n\nThe 1880s saw the establishment of a range of industries, including textiles, shipbuilding, and engineering. The city's population continued to grow, with the arrival of immigrants from Europe, Asia, and the Pacific.\n\n# 20th century\n\n## 1900sâ1940s\n\nThe early 20th century saw significant growth and development in Sydney, driven by the expansion of industry and the growth of the city's population. The 1900s saw the establishment of a range of new industries, including automobiles, aircraft, and film production.\n\nDuring World War I, Sydney played an important role as a military base and a center for the war effort. The city's economy boomed, with the establishment of a range of new industries and the growth of the public sector.\n\nThe 1920s and 1930s saw significant cultural and social change in Sydney, with the establishment of a range of new institutions, including the Sydney Symphony Orchestra and the Australian Ballet.\n\n## 1950sâ1990s\n\nThe post-war period saw significant growth and development in Sydney, driven by the expansion of industry and the growth of the city's population. The 1950s and 1960s saw the establishment of a range of new industries, including computing, biotechnology, and finance.\n\nThe 1970s and 1980s saw significant cultural and social change in Sydney, with the establishment of a range of new institutions, including the Sydney Opera House and the Museum of Contemporary Art.\n\nThe 1990s saw significant economic growth in Sydney, driven by the expansion of the finance sector and the growth of international trade.\n\n# 21st century\n\n## 2000s\n\nThe early 21st century saw significant growth and development in Sydney, driven by the expansion of industry and the growth of the city's population. The 2000s saw the establishment of a range of new industries, including biotechnology, nanotechnology, and renewable energy.\n\nThe city hosted a range of major events, including the 2000 Summer Olympics and the 2008 World Youth Day. The city's economy continued to grow, with the expansion of the finance sector and the growth of international trade.\n\n## 2010s\n\nThe 2010s saw significant cultural and social change in Sydney, with the establishment of a range of new institutions, including the Barangaroo development and the Sydney Light Rail.\n\nThe city continued to grow and develop, with the expansion of industry and the growth of the city's population. The city's economy continued to boom, with the expansion of the finance sector and the growth of international trade.\n\n## 2020s\n\nThe 2020s have seen significant challenges for Sydney, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the bushfires of 2019-2020. However, the city has continued to grow and develop, with the expansion of industry and the growth of the city's population.\n\nThe city is expected to continue to play a major role in the Australian economy, with the expansion of the finance sector and the growth of international trade.\n\n# See also\n\n* History of Australia\n* History of New South Wales\n* List of Sydney suburbs\n* List of notable Sydneysiders\n\n# References\n\n* \n* \n* \n\n# Bibliography\n\n* \n* \n* \n\n# External links\n\n* City of Sydney website\n* NSW Government website\n* Australian Government website", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Timeline_of_Sydney\" following this outline:\n\n#Pre-Colonial\n#18thâ19th centuries\n##1770sâ1790s\n##1800sâ1840s\n##1850sâ1890s\n#20th century\n##1900sâ1940s\n##1950sâ1990s\n#21st century\n##2000s\n##2010s\n##2020s\n#See also\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The election marks a significant moment in Thai politics, following years of military rule and a contentious constitutional reform process.\n\n#Background\n\nThailand has experienced a tumultuous period in politics, marked by repeated military coups and a prolonged period of military rule. The 2014 military coup, led by General Prayut Chan-o-cha, overthrew the democratically elected government of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra. The military junta, known as the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO), ruled the country until 2019, when a general election was held.\n\nThe 2019 election saw the Palang Pracharath Party (PPRP), backed by the military, win the most seats in the House of Representatives. However, the election was marred by controversy and allegations of vote-rigging. The PPRP formed a coalition government with smaller parties, with General Prayut Chan-o-cha as prime minister.\n\nIn 2020, a constitutional reform process was initiated, which led to the amendment of the 2017 Constitution. The reform process was contentious, with opposition parties and civil society groups criticizing the limited scope of the reforms and the dominance of the military in the process.\n\n#Electoral System\n\nThailand's electoral system is a mixed-member proportional representation system. The House of Representatives has 500 members, with 400 elected by single-member constituencies and 100 elected by party-list proportional representation. The prime minister is elected by the House of Representatives.\n\n##Prime Ministerial Candidates\n\nSeveral parties have nominated prime ministerial candidates for the 2023 election. The main contenders include:\n\n* General Prayut Chan-o-cha (Palang Pracharath Party)\n* Pita Limjaroenrat (Move Forward Party)\n* Paetongtarn Shinawatra (Pheu Thai Party)\n* Anutin Charnvirakul (Bhumjaithai Party)\n\n##2022 Reapportionment and Redistricting\n\nIn 2022, the Election Commission of Thailand (ECT) conducted a reapportionment and redistricting exercise, which resulted in changes to constituency boundaries and the allocation of seats. The exercise was criticized by opposition parties, who alleged that it was biased in favor of the ruling PPRP.\n\n#Leading Up to the Election\n\nThe lead-up to the 2023 election has been marked by intense campaigning and debates. The main issues have included the economy, corruption, and the role of the military in politics.\n\nThe opposition parties, particularly the Move Forward Party and the Pheu Thai Party, have campaigned on a platform of reform and democratization. They have promised to reduce the influence of the military in politics and to implement policies to address inequality and poverty.\n\nThe ruling PPRP has campaigned on a platform of stability and continuity. They have emphasized the need for a strong and stable government to address the economic challenges facing the country.\n\n#Contesting Parties\n\nA total of 69 parties are contesting the 2023 election. The main parties include:\n\n* Palang Pracharath Party (PPRP)\n* Move Forward Party (MFP)\n* Pheu Thai Party (PTP)\n* Bhumjaithai Party (BJT)\n* Democrat Party (DP)\n\n#Overseas and Advanced Voting\n\nOverseas and advanced voting took place from May 6 to May 9, 2023.

They were the result of the intersection of various cultures, including French, African, and indigenous Taino, and played a significant role in shaping the history and identity of the region.\n\n## Etymology\n\nThe term \"Creole\" is derived from the French word \"crÃ©ole,\" which was used to describe people of mixed European and African ancestry who were born in the colonies. In the context of Saint-Domingue, the term referred specifically to the descendants of French colonizers and African slaves who were born in the colony.\n\n## Origin of the Saint-Domingue Creoles\n\nThe Saint-Domingue Creoles originated in the 17th century, when French colonizers arrived in the island of Hispaniola, which was then inhabited by the indigenous Taino people. The French established sugar plantations and brought African slaves to work on them. Over time, the French colonizers and African slaves intermarried, producing a population of mixed ancestry.\n\n## Saint-Domingue Creole society\n\nSaint-Domingue Creole society was complex and multi-layered. At the top of the social hierarchy were the white planters, who owned the sugar plantations and held significant economic and political power. Below them were the Creoles, who were often lighter-skinned and more educated than the African slaves. The Creoles worked as administrators, merchants, and artisans, and played a key role in the colony's economy.\n\n## Development of Creole culture\n\nCreole culture developed as a result of the intersection of French, African, and indigenous Taino influences. The Creoles developed their own language, which was a blend of French and African languages, as well as their own customs, traditions, and music. They also developed a distinct cuisine, which combined French, African, and indigenous ingredients and cooking techniques.\n\n## Freedoms of the Creoles and Affranchis\n\nDespite their mixed ancestry, the Creoles were considered to be free people, and they enjoyed certain rights and privileges that were denied to African slaves. They were allowed to own property, participate in commerce, and hold public office. However, their freedoms were limited by the fact that they were still considered to be inferior to white people.\n\n## Slavery in Saint-Domingue\n\nSlavery was a central institution in Saint-Domingue, and the majority of the population were African slaves who were brought to the colony to work on the sugar plantations. The slaves were subjected to harsh conditions, including physical abuse, malnutrition, and disease. Many slaves died as a result of their treatment, and those who survived were often forced to work long hours in difficult conditions.\n\n## African presence in Saint-Domingue\n\nThe African presence in Saint-Domingue was significant, and African slaves played a key role in shaping the colony's culture and identity. Many African slaves brought their own languages, customs, and traditions with them to the colony, and these were incorporated into Creole culture. African slaves also played a key role in the development of the colony's economy, and their labor was essential to the production of sugar.\n\n## European presence in Saint-Domingue\n\nThe European presence in Saint-Domingue was also significant, and European colonizers played a key role in shaping the colony's history and identity. The French established the colony and brought European customs, traditions, and institutions to the island. European colonizers also brought their own languages, including French, which became the dominant language of the colony.\n\n## Royalist curtailment of Creole rights\n\nIn the late 18th century, the French monarchy began to curtail the rights of the Creoles, who had become increasingly influential in the colony. The monarchy imposed new taxes and regulations on the Creoles, and limited their ability to participate in commerce and hold public office. This led to growing tensions between the Creoles and the French monarchy.\n\n## Downturn of Saint-Domingue's economy\n\nIn the late 18th century, Saint-Domingue's economy began to decline, due to a combination of factors including soil depletion, disease, and competition from other sugar-producing colonies. This led to growing poverty and inequality among the Creole population, and increased tensions between the Creoles and the French monarchy.\n\n## Saint-Domingue Creoles in the American Revolutionary War\n\nDuring the American Revolutionary War, many Creoles from Saint-Domingue fought on the side of the Americans, who were seeking independence from British rule. The Creoles saw parallels between their own struggles for freedom and the American cause, and many were inspired by the ideas of the American Revolution.\n\n# Revolutionary History of Saint-Domingue\n\nThe revolutionary history of Saint-Domingue began in the late 18th century, when growing tensions between the Creoles and the French monarchy led to a series of uprisings and rebellions.\n\n## The Rebellion of Saint-Domingue\n\nIn 1791, a slave uprising broke out in Saint-Domingue, led by a group of African slaves who were seeking freedom and equality. The uprising was brutally suppressed by the French authorities, but it marked the beginning of a long and bloody struggle for independence in the colony.\n\n## Civil War and Invasion of Santo Domingo\n\nIn 1802, Napoleon Bonaparte sent a large army to Saint-Domingue to quell the uprising and reassert French control over the colony. However, the French army was defeated by a coalition of Creoles and African slaves, led by Toussaint Louverture and Jean-Jacques Dessalines.\n\n## The Haitian Revolution in Saint-Domingue\n\nThe Haitian Revolution was a series of uprisings and rebellions that took place in Saint-Domingue between 1791 and 1804. The revolution was led by a coalition of Creoles and African slaves, who were seeking freedom, equality, and independence from French rule.\n\n## Genocide of the remaining whites in Saint-Domingue\n\nIn 1804, the Haitian Revolution came to an end, and the remaining whites in Saint-Domingue were massacred by the victorious Creoles and African slaves. This marked the end of French rule in the colony, and the beginning of Haiti's independence.\n\n## The Empire of Haiti\n\nIn 1804, Haiti became an independent nation, with Jean-Jacques Dessalines as its first leader. The new nation was named Haiti, which is derived from the Taino word for \"mountainous land.\" Haiti became the first independent black nation in the world, and it has been a symbol of black pride and resistance to colonialism ever since.\n\n# Saint-Domingue Creoles after the Haitian Revolution\n\nAfter the Haitian Revolution, many Creoles from Saint-Domingue left the island and settled in other parts of the world, including the United States, France, and the Caribbean.\n\n## Saint-Domingue Creoles in New Orleans, Louisiana\n\nMany Creoles from Saint-Domingue settled in New Orleans, Louisiana, where they became an important part of the city's cultural and economic life. The Creoles brought their own language, customs, and traditions with them to New Orleans, and these were incorporated into the city's unique cultural identity.\n\n## Saint-Domingue Creoles in Haiti\n\nMany Creoles from Saint-Domingue remained in Haiti after the revolution, where they played a key role in shaping the country's culture, politics, and economy. The Creoles were instrumental in creating Haiti's unique cultural identity, which is a blend of French, African, and indigenous Taino influences.\n\n# Culture\n\n## Creole French Language\n\nThe Creole French language is a unique dialect that emerged in Saint-Domingue as a result of the intersection of French and African languages.

His death in June 2023 led to a diplomatic dispute between Canada and India, with allegations of Indian responsibility in his killing. This article provides an overview of Nijjar's life, his involvement with Sikh organisations, the allegations against him, and the subsequent investigation and diplomatic fallout.\n\n# Early life and immigration to Canada\n\nHardeep Singh Nijjar was born in 1977 in the Punjab region of India. Little is known about his early life, but it is reported that he immigrated to Canada in the late 1990s. Nijjar settled in Surrey, British Columbia, which has a large Sikh population. He became involved in various Sikh organisations and community activities, eventually becoming a prominent figure in the Canadian Sikh community.\n\n# Involvement with Sikh organisations\n\nNijjar was involved with several Sikh organisations, including the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara, a prominent Sikh temple in Surrey. He also worked with the Khalsa Diwan Society, a Sikh organisation that runs various community programs and services. Nijjar was a vocal advocate for Sikh rights and was involved in various campaigns to promote Sikh awareness and understanding.\n\n# Allegations of militant activities\n\nNijjar was alleged to have been involved in militant activities, including supporting separatist movements in India. The Indian government had designated him as a terrorist and accused him of being involved in plots to kill Indian officials. However, these allegations were never proven, and Nijjar maintained that he was a peaceful activist.\n\n# Death, subsequent diplomatic dispute and criminal investigation\n\nOn June 18, 2023, Nijjar was shot and killed outside the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey. The killing sparked a diplomatic dispute between Canada and India, with allegations of Indian responsibility in his death.\n\n## Criminal investigation in Canada\n\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) launched an investigation into Nijjar's killing, and the Canadian government promised a thorough and transparent inquiry. The investigation is ongoing, but initial reports suggest that the killing may have been a targeted attack.\n\n## Allegation of Indian responsibility\n\nThe Canadian government has alleged that Indian agents may have been involved in Nijjar's killing. This allegation has been denied by the Indian government, which has maintained that it had nothing to do with the killing. However, the Canadian government has pointed to a pattern of Indian aggression towards Canadian Sikhs, including the harassment and intimidation of Sikh activists.\n\n## Diplomatic fallout\n\nThe killing of Nijjar has led to a significant deterioration in relations between Canada and India. The Canadian government has expelled an Indian diplomat, and India has retaliated by expelling a Canadian diplomat. The diplomatic fallout has also led to a freeze in bilateral relations, with both countries suspending official visits and trade talks.\n\n## Reactions\n\n### Indian Canadians\n\nThe Indian Canadian community has been shocked and outraged by Nijjar's killing. Many have expressed concerns about the safety and security of Sikh Canadians, particularly those who are involved in activism and community work. The community has also called for a thorough investigation into the killing and has demanded that those responsible be brought to justice.\n\n### Five Eyes\n\nThe Five Eyes intelligence alliance, which includes Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand, has expressed concerns about the killing of Nijjar. The alliance has warned against any attempts to intimidate or silence Sikh activists and has promised to support the Canadian government in its efforts to bring those responsible to justice.\n\n### Bangladesh\n\nBangladesh has condemned the killing of Nijjar and has expressed concerns about the safety and security of minority communities in Canada. The Bangladeshi government has also called for a thorough investigation into the killing and has promised to support the Canadian government in its efforts to bring those responsible to justice.\n\n### Pakistan\n\nPakistan has condemned the killing of Nijjar and has expressed concerns about the safety and security of Sikh Canadians. The Pakistani government has also called for a thorough investigation into the killing and has promised to support the Canadian government in its efforts to bring those responsible to justice.\n\n### Sri Lanka\n\nSri Lanka has condemned the killing of Nijjar and has expressed concerns about the safety and security of minority communities in Canada. The Sri Lankan government has also called for a thorough investigation into the killing and has promised to support the Canadian government in its efforts to bring those responsible to justice.\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is based on publicly available information and does not include any citations or references.

It is a 5x5 grid of letters that reads the same way horizontally, vertically, and diagonally, forming a palindrome. The square is composed of five Latin words: SATOR, AREPO, TENET, OPERA, and ROTAS. The Sator Square has been found in various forms and locations, from ancient Roman ruins to medieval churches, and its meaning and purpose have been the subject of much speculation and debate.\n\nDescription and Naming\n--------------------\n\nThe Sator Square is a 5x5 grid of letters, with each row and column forming a Latin word. The square is typically written as follows:\n\nS A T O R\nA R E P O\nT E N E T\nO P E R A\nR O T A S\n\nThe square is named after the first word, SATOR, which is Latin for \"sower\" or \"farmer.\" The other words in the square are AREPO, TENET, OPERA, and ROTAS.\n\nDiscovery and Dating\n--------------------\n\nThe Sator Square has been found in various locations, including ancient Roman ruins, medieval churches, and manuscripts. The earliest known examples of the Sator Square date back to the 1st century AD, during the Roman Empire. However, the square may have been created earlier, as some scholars believe that it may have been inspired by ancient Greek word puzzles.\n\nTranslation\n------------\n\nThe Sator Square is composed of five Latin words: SATOR, AREPO, TENET, OPERA, and ROTAS. Each word has a specific meaning, and together they form a sentence or phrase.\n\n### Individual Words\n\n* SATOR: Latin for \"sower\" or \"farmer\"\n* AREPO: possibly derived from the Greek word \"harpe,\" meaning \"to reap\" or \"to plow\"\n* TENET: Latin for \"holds\" or \"possesses\"\n* OPERA: Latin for \"work\" or \"deed\"\n* ROTAS: Latin for \"wheels\" or \"rotation\"\n\n### Sentence Construction\n\nThe words in the Sator Square can be rearranged to form a sentence or phrase. One possible translation is:\n\n\"SATOR AREPO TENET OPERA ROTAS\"\n\nWhich can be translated to:\n\n\"The sower Arepo holds the work of the wheels\"\n\nHowever, this translation is not universally accepted, and different scholars have proposed different interpretations.\n\n### Arepo Interpretations\n\nThe word AREPO is particularly enigmatic, and its meaning has been the subject of much debate. Some scholars believe that it may be derived from the Greek word \"harpe,\" meaning \"to reap\" or \"to plow.\" Others have suggested that it may be a proper noun, possibly referring to a person or a place.\n\n### Further Anagrams\n\nThe Sator Square contains several anagrams, or words that can be formed by rearranging the letters. Some examples include:\n\n* \"PATER NOSTER\" (Latin for \"our father\")\n* \"ROTAS OPERA\" (Latin for \"wheels of work\")\n* \"TENET AREPO\" (Latin for \"holds the reaper\")\n\nOrigin and Meaning\n-----------------\n\nThe origin and meaning of the Sator Square are still a subject of debate among scholars. Several theories have been proposed, including:\n\n### Christian Symbol\n\nSome scholars believe that the Sator Square may have been created as a Christian symbol, possibly representing the unity and harmony of the Trinity. The square's use of the word \"SATOR,\" meaning \"sower,\" may refer to Jesus Christ as the sower of seeds.\n\n#### Adoption by Christians\n\nThe Sator Square was widely used by early Christians, and it can be found in many ancient Christian churches and manuscripts. However, it is unclear whether the square was originally created as a Christian symbol or whether it was adopted by Christians at a later date.\n\n#### Paternoster Theory\n\nSome scholars have suggested that the Sator Square may be related to the Paternoster, or Lord's Prayer. The square's use of the word \"PATER\" (Latin for \"father\") may refer to God the Father, while the word \"NOSTER\" (Latin for \"our\") may refer to the community of believers.\n\n### Roman Word Puzzle\n\nOther scholars believe that the Sator Square may have been created as a Roman word puzzle or game. The square's use of Latin words and its anagrammatic structure may have been intended to challenge and entertain.\n\n### Jewish Symbol\n\nSome scholars have suggested that the Sator Square may have been created as a Jewish symbol, possibly representing the unity and harmony of the Hebrew alphabet. However, this theory is not widely accepted.\n\n### Other Theories\n\nSeveral other theories have been proposed, including the idea that the Sator Square may have been created as a magical or mystical symbol, possibly representing the harmony and balance of the universe.\n\nMagical and Medical Associations\n---------------------------------\n\nThe Sator Square has been associated with magic and medicine in several cultures. In medieval Europe, the square was believed to have healing properties, and it was often used in medical treatments. In some African cultures, the square is believed to have magical powers, and it is used in rituals and spells.\n\nNotable Examples\n-----------------\n\nThe Sator Square can be found in many notable examples, including:\n\n### Roman\n\n* The Sator Square is inscribed on a Roman wall in the town of Cirencester, England.\n* A Roman mosaic featuring the Sator Square was discovered in the town of Salona, Croatia.\n\n### Early Medieval\n\n* The Sator Square is featured in the Lindisfarne Gospels, an illuminated manuscript from the 8th century.\n* A Sator Square is inscribed on a stone slab in the Church of St. Mary, in the town of Lastingham, England.\n\n### Later Medieval\n\n* The Sator Square is featured in the 13th-century manuscript, the \"Book of Kells.\"\n* A Sator Square is inscribed on a stone slab in the Church of St. Andrew, in the town of Greensted, England.\n\n### Other\n\n* The Sator Square is featured in the 19th-century novel, \"The Name of the Rose,\" by Umberto Eco.\n* A Sator Square is inscribed on a stone slab in the Church of St. Peter, in the town of Fritzlar, Germany.\n\nIn Popular Culture\n-----------------\n\nThe Sator Square has appeared in several works of popular culture, including:\n\n* The novel \"The Name of the Rose,\" by Umberto Eco.\n* The film \"The Name of the Rose,\" directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud.\n* The video game \"Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood,\" developed by Ubisoft.\n\nSee Also\n---------\n\n* Palindrome\n* Anagram\n* Word puzzle\n* Magic square\n\nNotes\n------\n\nThis article is a general overview of the Sator Square.

The film is a sequel to the 2001 film Gadar: Ek Prem Katha, and stars Sunny Deol, Ameesha Patel, and Utkarsh Sharma reprising their roles from the original film. The movie is set to release in 2023 and has generated significant buzz among fans and critics alike.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe plot of Gadar 2 is set 20 years after the events of the first film and follows the story of Tara Singh, a former Indian Army captain who had traveled to Pakistan to rescue his wife, Sakina, and bring her back to India. The sequel takes place in the present day, with Tara Singh now living a peaceful life in India with his family. However, a new threat emerges in the form of a Pakistani terrorist who seeks to wreak havoc on India, prompting Tara Singh to spring into action once again.\n\nAs the story unfolds, Tara Singh finds himself entangled in a web of intrigue and deception, with old enemies and new allies emerging at every turn. With his trademark bravery and patriotism, Tara Singh must use all his skills and experience to protect his family and country from the forces of evil. Along the way, he is joined by his son, Jeete, who has grown up to become a skilled warrior in his own right.\n\nThroughout the film, the themes of love, family, and patriotism are woven together to create a narrative that is both action-packed and emotionally resonant. With its mix of high-octane action sequences, heartwarming drama, and stirring patriotism, Gadar 2 promises to be a thrilling ride for audiences.\n\n# Cast\n\nThe cast of Gadar 2 includes:\n\n* Sunny Deol as Tara Singh\n* Ameesha Patel as Sakina\n* Utkarsh Sharma as Jeete Singh\n* Simrat Kaur as Jeete's love interest\n* Manish Wadhwa as Pakistani terrorist\n* Gaurav Chopra as Indian Army officer\n\n# Production\n\n## Development\n\nThe development of Gadar 2 began several years ago, with director Anil Sharma and writer Shaktimaan Talwar working on the script. The film was initially intended to be a remake of the original, but the team eventually decided to create a sequel instead. The story was developed to take place 20 years after the events of the first film, allowing for a new generation of characters to be introduced while still maintaining the core spirit of the original.\n\n## Casting\n\nThe casting process for Gadar 2 was a lengthy one, with the team taking their time to find the right actors for each role. Sunny Deol, Ameesha Patel, and Utkarsh Sharma were all approached to reprise their roles from the original film, and they agreed to come on board. The rest of the cast was assembled over the course of several months, with Simrat Kaur and Gaurav Chopra joining the film in key roles.\n\n# Soundtrack\n\nThe soundtrack for Gadar 2 is being composed by Mithoon, with lyrics by Sayeed Quadri. The album features a mix of patriotic anthems, romantic ballads, and high-energy action tracks. The music is expected to play a key role in the film, with several songs already generating buzz among fans.\n\n# Release\n\nGadar 2 is set to release in 2023, although an exact date has not been confirmed. The film will be released in theaters across India and internationally, with a simultaneous release on streaming platforms also possible.\n\n## Home media\n\nThe home media release of Gadar 2 is expected to follow several months after the film's theatrical release. The movie will be available on DVD, Blu-ray, and digital platforms, with a range of special features and behind-the-scenes content included.\n\n# Reception\n\n## Box office\n\nThe box office prospects for Gadar 2 are high, with the film expected to perform strongly in India and internationally. The original film was a major commercial success, and the sequel is likely to build on that momentum.

However, some critics may find the film's narrative to be overly simplistic or predictable, and the movie's success will ultimately depend on how well it resonates with audiences.\n\n## Accolades\n\nGadar 2 is expected to receive several awards and nominations, including Best Film, Best Director, and Best Actor for Sunny Deol. The film's music and action sequences are also likely to be recognized, with several technical awards possible.\n\n# Sequel\n\nA sequel to Gadar 2 is already in development, with the team planning to take the story forward with a new generation of characters. The next film is expected to introduce new heroes and villains, while still maintaining the core spirit of the original.\n\n# Notes\n\n* Gadar 2 marks the return of Sunny Deol to the big screen after a several-year hiatus.\n* The film's action sequences were choreographed by international stunt experts.\n* Gadar 2 is one of the most expensive Indian films ever made, with a budget of over â¹100 crore.\n\n# References\n\n*None*\n\n# External links\n\n* Gadar 2 on IMDb\n* Gadar 2 on Facebook\n* Gadar 2 on Twitter", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Gadar_2\" following this outline:\n\n#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production\n##Development\n##Casting\n#Soundtrack\n#Release\n##Home media\n#Reception\n##Box office\n##Critical response\n##Accolades\n#Sequel\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The clashes resulted in significant human losses and infrastructure damage on both sides, and marked a significant escalation of the ongoing Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict.\n\n#Background\n\nThe Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict has its roots in the early 20th century, but the current tensions between the two countries began in the late 1980s with the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. The conflict escalated into a full-scale war in the early 1990s, resulting in the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people and significant human losses. Despite a ceasefire agreement in 1994, the conflict has continued to simmer, with periodic outbreaks of violence and clashes between Armenian and Azerbaijani forces.\n\nIn recent years, tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan have increased, with both sides accusing each other of aggression and provocation. The situation has been further complicated by the involvement of external actors, including Russia and Turkey, which have their own interests and agendas in the region.\n\n#Timeline\n\n## 12â13 September\n\nThe clashes began on September 12, 2022, with exchanges of fire between Armenian and Azerbaijani forces in the eastern part of Armenia, near the border with Azerbaijan. The Armenian Ministry of Defense reported that Azerbaijani forces had launched a large-scale attack on Armenian positions, using artillery, mortars, and drones. The Azerbaijani Ministry of Defense denied the allegations, claiming that Armenian forces had initiated the clashes.\n\nOver the next 24 hours, the clashes intensified, with both sides reporting significant losses. The Armenian Ministry of Defense reported that at least 49 Armenian soldiers had been killed, while the Azerbaijani Ministry of Defense reported that at least 50 Azerbaijani soldiers had been killed.\n\n## 14â16 September\n\nOn September 14, 2022, the clashes spread to other parts of Armenia, including the southern region of Syunik, which borders Azerbaijan's Nakhchivan exclave.

The Armenian Ministry of Defense reported that at least 20 Armenian soldiers had been killed, while the Azerbaijani Ministry of Defense reported that at least 30 Azerbaijani soldiers had been killed.\n\n## 21â29 September\n\nAfter a brief lull in the fighting, the clashes resumed on September 21, 2022, with exchanges of fire between Armenian and Azerbaijani forces in the eastern part of Armenia. The Armenian Ministry of Defense reported that Azerbaijani forces had launched a large-scale attack on Armenian positions, using artillery, mortars, and drones.\n\nOver the next week, the clashes continued, with both sides reporting significant losses. The Armenian Ministry of Defense reported that at least 100 Armenian soldiers had been killed, while the Azerbaijani Ministry of Defense reported that at least 150 Azerbaijani soldiers had been killed.\n\n#Shelling of Russian military\n\nOn September 14, 2022, the Russian Ministry of Defense reported that Russian peacekeeping forces had come under fire in Nagorno-Karabakh. The ministry reported that Azerbaijani forces had launched a mortar attack on Russian positions, wounding two Russian soldiers.\n\nThe incident was widely condemned by Russia, which accused Azerbaijan of deliberately targeting Russian peacekeeping forces. The Azerbaijani Ministry of Defense denied the allegations, claiming that Russian forces had been caught in the crossfire between Armenian and Azerbaijani forces.\n\n#Suspected war crimes and crimes against humanity\n\nHuman rights organizations have reported that both Armenian and Azerbaijani forces have committed suspected war crimes and crimes against humanity during the clashes. The organizations have reported that civilians have been deliberately targeted, and that prisoners of war have been mistreated.\n\nThe Armenian Ministry of Defense has denied the allegations, claiming that Armenian forces have acted in accordance with international humanitarian law.

The Armenian Ministry of Emergency Situations has reported that at least 20 schools and kindergartens have been damaged or destroyed, while the Azerbaijani Ministry of Emergency Situations has reported that at least 30 schools and kindergartens have been damaged or destroyed.\n\nThe clashes have also resulted in significant damage to roads, bridges, and other critical infrastructure. The Armenian Ministry of Transport has reported that at least 10 roads have been damaged or destroyed, while the Azerbaijani Ministry of Transport has reported that at least 20 roads have been damaged or destroyed.\n\n#Effects\n\n## Cancelled events\n\nThe clashes have resulted in the cancellation of several high-profile events, including a planned meeting between the Armenian and Azerbaijani foreign ministers. The meeting was scheduled to take place in September 2022, but was cancelled due to the clashes.\n\n## Protests in Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh\n\nThe clashes have sparked widespread protests in Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh. Thousands of people have taken to the streets to demand action from the government and to condemn Azerbaijani aggression.\n\n## Anti-war opposition in Azerbaijan\n\nThe clashes have also sparked anti-war protests in Azerbaijan. Hundreds of people have taken to the streets to demand an end to the fighting and to condemn the government's handling of the conflict.\n\n## Sports\n\nThe clashes have had a significant impact on sports in the region.

The film is a sequel to the 2012 film OMG â Oh My God!.\n\nPlot\n----\n\nOMG_2 is set in a small town in India where a group of people are struggling to make ends meet. The film follows the story of a young man named Kanji, who is a struggling artist trying to make a name for himself. Kanji is a devout follower of Lord Krishna and is often seen talking to him in his prayers. One day, Kanji's prayers are answered, and he receives a divine message from Lord Krishna.\n\nThe message inspires Kanji to take on the corrupt and powerful people in his town, who are exploiting the poor and vulnerable. Kanji decides to file a public interest litigation (PIL) against the corrupt officials and businessmen, but he faces stiff resistance from them.\n\nAs Kanji's case gains attention, he becomes an unlikely hero in the eyes of the people. However, he also faces challenges from his own family and friends, who are skeptical of his divine mission. The film follows Kanji's journey as he navigates the complexities of the Indian justice system and confronts the corrupt forces head-on.\n\nCast\n----\n\nThe film features a talented ensemble cast, including:\n\n* Kanji, played by Pankaj Tripathi, a struggling artist and the protagonist of the film.\n* Lord Krishna, played by Akshay Kumar, who appears to Kanji in his prayers and inspires him to take on the corrupt forces.\n* Kanji's wife, played by Yami Gautam, who is initially skeptical of Kanji's divine mission but eventually becomes his biggest supporter.\n* The corrupt official, played by Paresh Rawal, who is determined to stop Kanji's PIL and maintain the status quo.\n* The businessman, played by Govind Namdeo, who is involved in various shady dealings and is opposed to Kanji's crusade.\n\nProduction\n------------\n\n### Development and casting\n\nThe development of OMG_2 began in 2019, when Amit Rai was approached by Viacom18 Motion Pictures to direct a sequel to the successful film OMG â Oh My God!. Rai was initially hesitant, but after reading the script, he was convinced that the story had the potential to be a powerful commentary on the state of Indian society.\n\nThe casting process was a lengthy one, with Rai and the producers taking several months to finalize the cast. Pankaj Tripathi was the first to be cast, and he was followed by Akshay Kumar, who agreed to play the role of Lord Krishna. The rest of the cast was finalized over the next few months, with Yami Gautam, Paresh Rawal, and Govind Namdeo joining the film.\n\n### Filming\n\nThe filming of OMG_2 began in January 2020 and took place over several months. The film was shot on location in various parts of India, including Mumbai, Delhi, and Rajasthan. The shoot was a challenging one, with the cast and crew facing several logistical issues and delays.\n\nDespite the challenges, the film's director, Amit Rai, was determined to bring the story to life in a way that was both authentic and impactful. Rai worked closely with the cast and crew to ensure that every scene was shot with precision and attention to detail.\n\nMusic\n------\n\nThe music of OMG_2 was composed by a team of talented musicians, including Himesh Reshammiya and Ajay-Atul. The film's soundtrack features a mix of devotional songs, romantic ballads, and energetic dance numbers. The lyrics were written by several prominent lyricists, including Kumaar, Irshad Kamil, and Manoj Muntashir.\n\nThe film's title track, \"OMG_2\", was released in August 2020 and became an instant hit. The song, which features the film's lead actors, Pankaj Tripathi and Akshay Kumar, is a catchy and upbeat number that showcases the film's themes of spirituality and social justice.\n\nRelease\n--------\n\nOMG_2 was initially scheduled to release in October 2020, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the release was postponed several times.

Founded in 1925, the club has a rich history and has become one of the most successful and popular football clubs in Greece.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### Early years (1925â1931)\n\nOlympiacos was founded on March 10, 1925, by a group of Greek refugees from Smyrna who had settled in Piraeus. The club's early years were marked by struggles, but they eventually found success in the 1920s, winning several local tournaments.\n\n### Domination in Greece and World War II (1931â1946)\n\nIn the 1930s, Olympiacos began to establish itself as a major force in Greek football. The club won its first Greek championship in 1931 and went on to dominate the league, winning five more titles in the decade. During World War II, the club's activities were suspended, but Olympiacos continued to play friendly matches and participate in local tournaments.\n\n### The Legend (1946â1959)\n\nAfter the war, Olympiacos resumed its dominance of Greek football, winning seven league titles between 1946 and 1959. This period is often referred to as the \"Golden Era\" of the club. The team was led by legendary players such as Andreas Mouratis, Giorgos Darivas, and Giannis Ioannou.\n\n### First international success and MÃ¡rton Bukovi era (1960â1972)\n\nIn the 1960s, Olympiacos began to make its mark on the international stage, participating in European competitions for the first time. The club's first major international success came in 1968, when they reached the quarterfinals of the European Cup, where they were eliminated by Juventus. This period also saw the arrival of Hungarian coach MÃ¡rton Bukovi, who led the team to two league titles and a Greek Cup.\n\n### Goulandris era (1972â1975)\n\nIn 1972, Olympiacos was taken over by the wealthy Greek shipping magnate Giorgos Goulandris. During his presidency, the club invested heavily in new players and infrastructure, but ultimately failed to achieve significant success.\n\n### Domination in the early 1980s, four consecutive League titles (1975â1987)\n\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, Olympiacos experienced a resurgence, winning four consecutive league titles between 1979 and 1982. The team was led by players such as Maik Galakos, Tasos Mitropoulos, and Nikos Anastopoulos.\n\n### The Stone Years, UEFA Cup quarter-finalists (1987â1996)\n\nThe late 1980s and early 1990s were marked by a decline in Olympiacos' fortunes, with the club failing to win a league title between 1987 and 1996. However, the team did experience some success in European competitions, reaching the quarterfinals of the UEFA Cup in 1993, where they were eliminated by Boavista.\n\n### The Golden Era (1996â2010)\n\n#### Seven consecutive League titles, near-miss to UEFA Champions League semi-finals (1996â2003)\n\nIn 1996, Olympiacos began a period of unprecedented success, winning seven consecutive league titles between 1997 and 2003. The team also experienced significant success in European competitions, reaching the quarterfinals of the UEFA Champions League in 1999, where they were eliminated by Juventus.\n\n#### Five consecutive League titles, Two presences in UEFA Champions League knockout phase (2004â2010)\n\nBetween 2004 and 2009, Olympiacos won five more league titles, cementing their status as one of the dominant forces in Greek football. The team also participated in the UEFA Champions League knockout phase twice, in 2008 and 2010.\n\n### New presidency, seven consecutive League titles and European ascent (2010â2017)\n\nIn 2010, Evangelos Marinakis took over as president of Olympiacos, marking the beginning of a new era of success for the club. Between 2011 and 2017, the team won seven consecutive league titles, as well as several domestic cups. The team also experienced significant success in European competitions, participating in the UEFA Champions League group stage multiple times.\n\n### European successes, three consecutive Greek League titles (2017â2023)\n\nIn 2017, Olympiacos began a new period of success, winning three consecutive league titles between 2020 and 2022. The team also experienced significant success in European competitions, reaching the quarterfinals of the UEFA Europa League in 2020.\n\n### UEFA Europa Conference League Winners & UEFA Youth League Winners (2023â24)\n\nIn the 2023-2024 season, Olympiacos won the UEFA Europa Conference League, defeating Marseille 4-1 in the final. The team's youth squad also won the UEFA Youth League, defeating Barcelona 3-1 in the final.\n\nCrest and colours\n-----------------\n\n### Kit evolution\n\nOlympiacos' kit has undergone several changes throughout the club's history.

He later earned a master's degree in economics from the same institution.\n\n#Economics career\n\nMilei began his career as an economist in the private sector, working for several consulting firms and financial institutions.

{"title": "Indeterminacy_debate_in_legal_theory", "content": "#See also\n#Bibliography\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Indeterminacy Debate in Legal Theory\n\nThe indeterminacy debate in legal theory revolves around the question of whether the law is inherently determinate or indeterminate. This debate has significant implications for how we understand the nature of law, the role of judges and lawyers, and the relationship between law and society. At its core, the debate centers on the issue of whether the law provides clear and unambiguous answers to legal questions, or whether it is inherently ambiguous and open to multiple interpretations.\n\n# History of the Debate\n\nThe indeterminacy debate has its roots in the early 20th century, when legal realists such as Oliver Wendell Holmes and Jerome Frank challenged the traditional view of law as a fixed and determinate system. These legal realists argued that the law is inherently uncertain and that judges have significant discretion in interpreting the law. This view was seen as a challenge to the traditional understanding of law as a set of clear and unambiguous rules.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, the indeterminacy debate gained momentum with the rise of critical legal studies (CLS). CLS scholars, such as Duncan Kennedy and Mark Tushnet, argued that the law is inherently indeterminate and that judges have significant power to shape the law through their interpretations. This view was seen as a challenge to the traditional understanding of law as a neutral and objective system.\n\n# The Case for Indeterminacy\n\nProponents of indeterminacy argue that the law is inherently ambiguous and open to multiple interpretations. They point to several factors that contribute to indeterminacy, including:\n\n## Ambiguity of Legal Language\n\nLegal language is often ambiguous and open to multiple interpretations. Words and phrases can have different meanings in different contexts, and judges must use their discretion to interpret the law. For example, the phrase \"reasonable person\" is a common legal standard, but what constitutes a \"reasonable person\" can vary depending on the context.\n\n## Complexity of Legal Rules\n\nLegal rules are often complex and open to multiple interpretations. Statutes and regulations can be ambiguous, and judges must use their discretion to interpret the law. For example, tax laws are notoriously complex, and judges must use their expertise to interpret the law.\n\n## Discretion of Judges\n\nJudges have significant discretion in interpreting the law. They must use their expertise and judgment to apply the law to specific facts, and this can lead to different outcomes in similar cases.\n\n## Social and Cultural Factors\n\nSocial and cultural factors can influence how judges interpret the law. Judges are products of their social and cultural context, and this can shape their understanding of the law. For example, judges from different cultural backgrounds may have different understandings of what constitutes a \"reasonable person.\"\n\n# The Case for Determinacy\n\nProponents of determinacy argue that the law is inherently determinate and that judges can apply the law in a neutral and objective manner. They point to several factors that contribute to determinacy, including:\n\n## Clarity of Legal Language\n\nLegal language can be clear and unambiguous, providing a clear guide for judges and lawyers. For example, the phrase \"speed limit\" is a clear and unambiguous legal standard.\n\n## Precision of Legal Rules\n\nLegal rules can be precise and clear, providing a clear guide for judges and lawyers. For example, tax laws can be precise and clear, providing a clear guide for taxpayers and tax authorities.\n\n## Precedent\n\nPrecedent can provide a clear guide for judges and lawyers, ensuring that similar cases are decided in a consistent manner. For example, the doctrine of stare decisis provides a clear guide for judges to follow precedent.\n\n## Institutional Constraints\n\nInstitutional constraints can limit the discretion of judges and ensure that the law is applied in a neutral and objective manner. For example, the doctrine of judicial review provides a check on the power of judges to interpret the law.\n\n# Implications of the Debate\n\nThe indeterminacy debate has significant implications for how we understand the nature of law, the role of judges and lawyers, and the relationship between law and society. If the law is inherently indeterminate, then judges have significant discretion in interpreting the law, and this can lead to different outcomes in similar cases. On the other hand, if the law is inherently determinate, then judges can apply the law in a neutral and objective manner, and this can ensure consistency and predictability in the application of the law.\n\n# See also\n\n* Critical legal studies\n* Legal realism\n* Judicial discretion\n* Precedent\n* Institutional constraints\n\n# Bibliography\n\n(Note: Please add relevant sources to the bibliography section)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Indeterminacy_debate_in_legal_theory\" following this outline:\n\n#See also\n#Bibliography\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The event was announced on July 23, 2022, with tickets going on sale on August 3, 2022. The event was part of WWE's partnership with the Saudi General Entertainment Authority, which began in 2018.\n\n### Iranian attack concerns\n\nPrior to the event, there were concerns about the safety of WWE personnel due to the 2022 Iranian attacks on Saudi Arabia. WWE issued a statement stating that they were \"closely monitoring\" the situation and working with local and international authorities to ensure the safety of everyone involved.\n\n### Storylines\n\nThe event featured eight matches, including a main event for the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship. The card comprised matches that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.\n\n#### Main event match\n\nThe main event of Crown Jewel saw Roman Reigns defend the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship against Logan Paul. The match was Paul's first singles match for the WWE, having previously competed in a few tag team matches. Paul's challenge for the title was set up on the September 16 episode of SmackDown, where he confronted Reigns and announced his intentions to become the new champion.\n\n#### Undercard matches\n\nThe undercard featured several matches, including a steel cage match between Drew McIntyre and Karrion Kross, which was set up on the October 14 episode of SmackDown. Another match saw Bray Wyatt face off against LA Knight in a Mountain Dew Pitch Black match, which was announced on the October 28 episode of SmackDown.\n\nEvent\n------\n\n### Preliminary matches\n\nThe event began with a match between The Usos (Jimmy Uso and Jey Uso) and The Brawling Brutes (Sheamus and Ridge Holland), with the winners earning a shot at the Undisputed WWE Tag Team Championship.

Damage CTRL emerged victorious, with IYO SKY pinning Asuka after a moonsault.\n\n### Main event\n\nThe main event saw Roman Reigns defend the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship against Logan Paul. The match was a highly contested one, with both men trading blows and near falls. In the end, Reigns emerged victorious, pinning Paul after a spear.\n\nReception\n----------\n\nCrown Jewel received mixed reviews from critics and fans alike. Some praised the event for its high-quality matches, while others criticized the lack of build-up and the reliance on Saudi Arabian interests.\n\nAftermath\n----------\n\n### Raw\n\nThe following night on Raw, Roman Reigns celebrated his successful title defense against Logan Paul. However, his celebration was short-lived, as he was confronted by Seth Rollins, who announced his intentions to challenge Reigns for the title.\n\n### SmackDown\n\nOn the following episode of SmackDown, The Usos (Jimmy Uso and Jey Uso) faced off against The New Day (Kofi Kingston and Xavier Woods) for the Undisputed WWE Tag Team Championship.

From its humble beginnings as a form of mountaineering to the modern day sport that we know today, rock climbing has evolved significantly over the years. This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the history of rock climbing, from its origins to the present day.\n\n# Origins\n\nThe earliest recorded instances of rock climbing date back to ancient civilizations, where people would climb rocks and mountains for spiritual, hunting, or trading purposes. In ancient Greece, for example, the Oracle of Delphi was located on the slopes of Mount Parnassus, which required a climb to reach. Similarly, in ancient Tibet, Buddhist monks would climb mountains to meditate and seek enlightenment.\n\nHowever, modern rock climbing as we know it today originated in the mid-19th century in Europe, particularly in the Alps. During this time, mountaineering became a popular activity among the upper class, and climbers began to seek out more challenging routes and peaks. The formation of the Alpine Club in London in 1857 marked the beginning of organized mountaineering, and rock climbing soon followed.\n\n# 19th century\n\nIn the late 19th century, rock climbing began to take shape as a distinct activity from mountaineering. The development of new equipment, such as ropes, pitons, and carabiners, made it possible for climbers to tackle more difficult routes and terrain. The first rock climbing competition was held in 1865 in the Swiss Alps, and the sport quickly gained popularity throughout Europe.\n\nOne of the earliest and most influential rock climbers of this era was Albert Mummery, a British climber who made several notable ascents in the Alps. Mummery's approach to climbing was characterized by his emphasis on technical skill and his willingness to take risks, which set the stage for future generations of climbers.\n\n# 1900s\n\nThe early 20th century saw significant advances in rock climbing technology and technique. The development of new equipment, such as the ice axe and crampons, allowed climbers to tackle more challenging terrain and conditions. The introduction of piton-based aid climbing also opened up new possibilities for climbers, particularly in the Alps.\n\nDuring this period, rock climbing began to spread beyond Europe, with climbers in North America and Asia also taking up the sport. The formation of the American Alpine Club in 1902 and the Japan Alpine Club in 1905 marked the beginning of organized rock climbing in these regions.\n\n# 1910s\n\nThe 1910s saw the rise of a new generation of rock climbers, who were influenced by the likes of Mummery and other early pioneers. One of the most notable climbers of this era was Geoffrey Winthrop Young, a British climber who made several notable ascents in the Alps and Dolomites.\n\nYoung's approach to climbing was characterized by his emphasis on style and aesthetics, and he is often credited with developing the concept of \"free climbing,\" which emphasizes the use of only the hands, feet, and other body parts to make progress up a route.\n\n# 1920s\n\nThe 1920s saw significant advances in rock climbing technique and equipment. The development of new pitons and carabiners made it possible for climbers to tackle more difficult routes, and the introduction of the \"karabiner clip\" revolutionized the sport by allowing climbers to quickly and easily attach and detach themselves from the rope.\n\nDuring this period, rock climbing also became more formalized, with the establishment of the International Climbing and Mountaneering Federation (UIAA) in 1932. The UIAA established standardized rules and regulations for climbing competitions and helped to promote the sport globally.\n\n# 1930s\n\nThe 1930s saw the rise of a new generation of rock climbers, who were influenced by the likes of Young and other early pioneers. One of the most notable climbers of this era was Anderl Heckmair, a German climber who made several notable ascents in the Alps and Dolomites.\n\nHeckmair's approach to climbing was characterized by his emphasis on technical skill and his willingness to take risks, and he is often credited with developing the concept of \"direct climbing,\" which emphasizes the use of the most direct and efficient route to the top of a climb.\n\n# 1940s\n\nThe 1940s saw significant advances in rock climbing equipment and technique. The development of new materials, such as nylon and aluminum, made it possible for climbers to create lighter and more durable equipment. The introduction of the \"quickdraw\" also revolutionized the sport by allowing climbers to quickly and easily attach and detach themselves from the rope.\n\nDuring this period, rock climbing also became more popular in North America, with the establishment of the Sierra Club in 1892 and the Appalachian Mountain Club in 1876. These organizations helped to promote the sport and provide access to climbing areas for members.\n\n# 1950s\n\nThe 1950s saw the rise of a new generation of rock climbers, who were influenced by the likes of Heckmair and other early pioneers. One of the most notable climbers of this era was John SalathÃ©, a Swiss-American climber who made several notable ascents in Yosemite National Park.\n\nSalathÃ©'s approach to climbing was characterized by his emphasis on technical skill and his willingness to take risks, and he is often credited with developing the concept of \"big wall climbing,\" which emphasizes the use of aid climbing techniques to ascend large, vertical walls.\n\n# 1960s\n\nThe 1960s saw significant advances in rock climbing equipment and technique. The development of new materials, such as Kevlar and titanium, made it possible for climbers to create lighter and more durable equipment. The introduction of the \"cams\" also revolutionized the sport by allowing climbers to quickly and easily attach and detach themselves from the rock.\n\nDuring this period, rock climbing also became more popular globally, with the establishment of the International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC) in 2007. The IFSC helped to promote the sport and provide access to climbing competitions for athletes from around the world.\n\n# 1970s\n\nThe 1970s saw the rise of a new generation of rock climbers, who were influenced by the likes of SalathÃ© and other early pioneers. One of the most notable climbers of this era was Reinhold Messner, an Italian climber who made several notable ascents in the Himalayas and Karakoram.\n\nMessner's approach to climbing was characterized by his emphasis on technical skill and his willingness to take risks, and he is often credited with developing the concept of \"alpine climbing,\" which emphasizes the use of lightweight equipment and efficient techniques to ascend complex routes.\n\n# 1980s\n\nThe 1980s saw significant advances in rock climbing equipment and technique. The development of new materials, such as carbon fiber and ceramic, made it possible for climbers to create lighter and more durable equipment. The introduction of the \"sport climbing\" also revolutionized the sport by allowing climbers to focus on technical skill and physical fitness.\n\nDuring this period, rock climbing also became more popular in Europe, with the establishment of the European Climbing Federation (EFC) in 1990. The EFC helped to promote the sport and provide access to climbing competitions for athletes from around Europe.\n\n# 1990s\n\nThe 1990s saw the rise of a new generation of rock climbers, who were influenced by the likes of Messner and other early pioneers. One of the most notable climbers of this era was Lynn Hill, an American climber who made several notable ascents in Yosemite National Park.\n\nHill's approach to climbing was characterized by her emphasis on technical skill and her willingness to take risks, and she is often credited with developing the concept of \"free solo climbing,\" which emphasizes the use of only the hands, feet, and other body parts to make progress up a route without the use of ropes or other safety equipment.\n\n# 2000s\n\nThe 2000s saw significant advances in rock climbing equipment and technique. The development of new materials, such as nanotube and graphene, made it possible for climbers to create lighter and more durable equipment. The introduction of the \"bouldering\" also revolutionized the sport by allowing climbers to focus on short, intense climbs without the use of ropes or other safety equipment.\n\nDuring this period, rock climbing also became more popular globally, with the establishment of the International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC) in 2007. The IFSC helped to promote the sport and provide access to climbing competitions for athletes from around the world.\n\n# 2010s\n\nThe 2010s saw the rise of a new generation of rock climbers, who were influenced by the likes of Hill and other early pioneers. One of the most notable climbers of this era was Alex Honnold, an American climber who made several notable ascents in Yosemite National Park.\n\nHonnold's approach to climbing was characterized by his emphasis on technical skill and his willingness to take risks, and he is often credited with developing the concept of \"free solo climbing,\" which emphasizes the use of only the hands, feet, and other body parts to make progress up a route without the use of ropes or other safety equipment.\n\n# 2020s\n\nThe 2020s have seen significant advances in rock climbing equipment and technique. The development of new materials, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, has made it possible for climbers to create more efficient and effective training programs. The introduction of the \"virtual climbing\" has also revolutionized the sport by allowing climbers to train and compete in virtual environments.\n\nDuring this period, rock climbing has also become more popular globally, with the inclusion of sport climbing in the 2020 Summer Olympics. The International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC) has helped to promote the sport and provide access to climbing competitions for athletes from around the world.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of climbers\n* List of climbing equipment manufacturers\n* List of climbing competitions\n* Rock climbing terminology\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a general overview of the history of rock climbing and is not intended to be a comprehensive or exhaustive treatment of the subject.\n\n# References\n\nThis article does not include any references or citations.\n\n# External links\n\n* International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC)\n* European Climbing Federation (EFC)\n* American Alpine Club (AAC)\n* Alpine Club (AC)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"History_of_rock_climbing\" following this outline:\n\n#Origins\n#19th century\n#1900s\n#1910s\n#1920s\n#1930s\n#1940s\n#1950s\n#1960s\n#1970s\n#1980s\n#1990s\n#2000s\n#2010s\n#2020s\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

However, as Vikram delves deeper into the case, he discovers that Vedha's motives are not as clear-cut as they seem. Vedha, who is a master storyteller, begins to narrate a series of stories that challenge Vikram's perceptions and blur the lines between good and evil.\n\nAs the story unfolds, Vikram's obsession with capturing Vedha grows, but he also begins to question his own morality and the true nature of justice. Meanwhile, Vedha's stories weave a complex web of characters and events that lead to a thrilling climax.\n\n# Cast\n\n* Hrithik Roshan as Vedha\n* Saif Ali Khan as Vikram\n* Radhika Apte as Priya\n* Rohit Saraf as Shatak\n* Sharib Hashmi as Babloo\n* Satyadeep Misra as SSP Abbas\n* Yogita Bihani as Chanda\n\n# Production\n\n## Development\n\nThe film was first announced in 2020, with PushkarâGayathri set to direct the remake of their 2017 Tamil film.

It has been a vital part of human culture for thousands of years, with evidence of pottery dating back to the Neolithic period. Pottery has played a significant role in the development of human societies, serving not only as a means of creating functional items but also as a form of artistic expression.\n\nMain Types\n------------\n\nPottery can be broadly classified into three main types based on the type of clay used, the firing temperature, and the resulting product.\n\n### Earthenware\n\nEarthenware is the most common type of pottery and is characterized by its earthy color and porous texture. It is made from a mixture of clay, water, and other minerals, and is fired at a relatively low temperature of around 1000Â°C (1832Â°F). Earthenware is often used to create functional items such as plates, bowls, and cups.\n\n### Stoneware\n\nStoneware is a type of pottery that is fired at a higher temperature than earthenware, typically between 1100Â°C to 1300Â°C (2012Â°F to 2372Â°F). This results in a denser and more durable product that is often used to create functional items such as cups, mugs, and storage containers.\n\n### Porcelain\n\nPorcelain is a type of pottery that is known for its whiteness, translucency, and strength. It is made from a specific type of clay called kaolin and is fired at an even higher temperature than stoneware, typically between 1250Â°C to 1400Â°C (2282Â°F to 2552Â°F). Porcelain is often used to create decorative items such as vases, figurines, and fine china.\n\nArchaeology\n------------\n\nThe study of pottery plays a significant role in archaeology, as it can provide valuable information about a culture's technological, social, and economic development.\n\n### Fabric Analysis\n\nFabric analysis is a technique used to analyze the composition and structure of pottery. By studying the fabric of a piece of pottery, archaeologists can determine the type of clay used, the firing temperature, and the techniques used to shape and decorate the piece.\n\nClay Bodies and Raw Materials\n-----------------------------\n\nClay bodies are the mixture of clay, water, and other minerals used to create pottery. The type of clay used can affect the final product's texture, color, and durability. Raw materials used in pottery include clay, silica, feldspar, and quartz.\n\nProduction\n------------\n\nThe production of pottery involves several stages, including shaping, drying, firing, and decorating.\n\n### Shaping\n\nShaping is the process of creating the desired form from the clay body. This can be done using various techniques such as hand-building, throwing on a potter's wheel, or using a mold.\n\n### Drying\n\nDrying is the process of removing excess moisture from the clay body. This can be done using various methods such as air-drying, using a drying rack, or using a controlled environment.\n\n### Firing\n\nFiring is the process of heating the clay body to a high temperature to achieve the desired properties. The firing process involves several stages, including:\n\n#### Temperature\n\nThe firing temperature can range from around 1000Â°C to 1400Â°C (1832Â°F to 2552Â°F), depending on the type of pottery being produced.\n\n#### Atmosphere\n\nThe firing atmosphere can be either oxidizing or reducing, depending on the type of pottery being produced. An oxidizing atmosphere is used to produce bright colors and clear glazes, while a reducing atmosphere is used to produce darker colors and more subtle glazes.\n\n#### Methods\n\nThere are several methods of firing, including:\n\n* Electric kilns\n* Gas kilns\n* Wood-fired kilns\n* Raku kilns\n\n#### Stages\n\nThe firing process involves several stages, including:\n\n* Bisque firing: This is the first firing stage, where the clay body is fired at a low temperature to remove excess moisture.\n* Glaze firing: This is the second firing stage, where the glaze is applied and fired at a higher temperature.\n\nDecorating\n------------\n\nDecorating is the process of adding visual interest to the pottery. Various methods can be used, including:\n\n### Methods\n\n* Hand-painting\n* Slip trailing\n* Stenciling\n* Carving\n* Glazing\n\nGlazing\n---------\n\nGlazing is the process of applying a layer of glaze to the pottery. Glaze is a mixture of chemicals that is applied to the pottery and fired at a high temperature to achieve the desired color and texture.\n\nHealth and Environmental Issues\n-------------------------------\n\nThe production of pottery can have health and environmental implications. For example:\n\n* Inhaling clay dust can cause respiratory problems\n* Using lead-based glazes can be toxic\n* Firing pottery can release pollutants into the air\n\nHistory\n--------\n\nThe history of pottery dates back to the Neolithic period. Here is a brief overview of the history of pottery by region:\n\n### Early Pottery\n\nThe earliest evidence of pottery dates back to around 9000 BC in the Fertile Crescent.\n\n### Beginnings of Pottery\n\nThe beginnings of pottery can be found in the ancient civilizations of Mesopotamia, Egypt, and the Indus Valley.\n\n### East Asia\n\nPottery has a long history in East Asia, dating back to the Neolithic period. The region is famous for its porcelain production, which began in the Han dynasty.\n\n### South Asia\n\nThe Indus Valley Civilization is famous for its sophisticated pottery production, which dates back to around 2500 BC.\n\n### Southeast Asia\n\nPottery has a long history in Southeast Asia, dating back to the Neolithic period. The region is famous for its earthenware production.\n\n### West Asia\n\nThe ancient civilizations of Mesopotamia and Persia are famous for their pottery production, which dates back to around 4000 BC.\n\n### Europe\n\nPottery has a long history in Europe, dating back to the Neolithic period.

The exodus occurred in the early 1990s, as a result of the Kashmir insurgency, and is considered one of the largest and most tragic migrations of people in recent Indian history.\n\n#Background\n\nKashmiri Hindus, also known as Kashmiri Pandits, have been an integral part of the Kashmir Valley's social fabric for centuries. They were the original inhabitants of the valley and had a distinct culture, language, and tradition. The Kashmiri Pandits were known for their learning, artistry, and administrative skills, and played a significant role in the region's politics, economy, and society.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Kashmiri Pandits began to migrate to other parts of India in search of better opportunities. However, a significant number of them remained in the Kashmir Valley, where they continued to live and work.\n\nIn the 1980s, the Kashmir Valley began to experience a rise in Islamist militancy, which was fueled by the Soviet-Afghan War and the subsequent influx of Islamist fighters into the region. The militancy was further fueled by the Indian government's perceived neglect of the region's economic and social problems.\n\n#Insurgency activity\n\nThe Kashmir insurgency, which began in the late 1980s, was led by a number of militant groups, including the Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) and the Hizbul Mujahideen. These groups sought to establish an independent Kashmir or merge it with Pakistan.\n\n##Attack and threats\n\nIn the early 1990s, the Kashmir insurgency turned violent, with militant groups launching attacks on Kashmiri Hindus and other minority groups.
