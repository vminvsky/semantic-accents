As a prominent figure in the PCR, Rădulescu held various high-ranking positions, including that of Minister of Culture and Minister of Education. He was known for his patronage of the arts and his efforts to promote Romanian culture, but also for his involvement in the country's authoritarian regime and his close relationship with Nicolae Ceaușescu, the country's dictator.\n\n# Biography\n\n## Early life and FSD\n\nGogu Rădulescu was born on May 20, 1917, in Bucharest, Romania. His early life and education are not well-documented, but it is known that he studied law at the University of Bucharest. Rădulescu became involved in politics at a young age, joining the Union of Communist Youth (UTC) in the mid-1930s. He quickly rose through the ranks of the organization, becoming a key figure in the UTC's leadership. In 1945, Rădulescu became a member of the Romanian Communist Party's (PCR) Central Committee, a position he held until his death.\n\n## Wartime desertion and return\n\nIn 1943, Rădulescu was drafted into the Romanian Army, which was fighting on the side of the Axis powers. However, he soon became disillusioned with the war effort and deserted, fleeing to the Soviet Union. There, he joined the Tudor Vladimirescu Division, a unit of Romanian communists who were fighting alongside the Soviets against the Axis powers. Rădulescu returned to Romania in 1945, where he was welcomed back by the PCR and quickly became a key figure in the party's leadership.\n\n## 1952 fall and 1956 recovery\n\nIn 1952, Rădulescu fell out of favor with the PCR's leadership, led by Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej. He was accused of being a \"right-wing deviationist\" and was removed from his position on the Central Committee. Rădulescu was also forced to undergo a period of \"re-education\" in the Soviet Union, where he was subjected to intense ideological indoctrination. However, he recovered his position in 1956, following the death of Gheorghiu-Dej. Rădulescu became a key ally of Nicolae Ceaușescu, who was then rising through the ranks of the PCR.\n\n## With Ceaușescu\n\nRădulescu's relationship with Ceaușescu was instrumental in his rise to prominence within the PCR. He became one of Ceaușescu's closest advisors, and played a key role in the latter's campaign to become General Secretary of the PCR. When Ceaușescu finally achieved this goal in 1965, Rădulescu was rewarded with a number of high-ranking positions, including that of Minister of Culture. In this role, Rădulescu was responsible for promoting Romanian culture and the arts, and he became known for his patronage of a number of prominent Romanian artists and writers.\n\n## Patronage and liberalism\n\nRădulescu's tenure as Minister of Culture was marked by a period of relative liberalism in Romanian cultural policy. He encouraged the development of a number of artistic and literary movements, and promoted the work of a number of prominent Romanian artists and writers. Rădulescu also became known for his patronage of the Romanian film industry, and played a key role in the development of a number of successful Romanian films. However, his liberalism was also accompanied by a growing authoritarianism, as Ceaușescu's regime became increasingly repressive.\n\n## Protochronism and austerity debates\n\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, Rădulescu became involved in a number of debates within the PCR over issues such as protochronism and austerity. Protochronism was a nationalist movement that emphasized the importance of Romanian culture and history, and Rădulescu was a key supporter of this movement. However, he also became involved in debates over austerity, as Ceaușescu's regime implemented a number of severe economic measures in an attempt to pay off the country's foreign debt.\n\n## Downfall, prosecution, and death\n\nRădulescu's downfall came in 1984, when he was accused of corruption and removed from his position as Minister of Culture. He was subsequently prosecuted and sentenced to prison, where he died in 1991. Rădulescu's death marked the end of an era in Romanian politics, and he was remembered by many as a symbol of the country's authoritarian regime.\n\n# Legacy\n\nGogu Rădulescu's legacy is complex and multifaceted. On the one hand, he played a key role in promoting Romanian culture and the arts, and his patronage of a number of prominent Romanian artists and writers helped to establish the country as a major cultural center. On the other hand, his involvement in Ceaușescu's authoritarian regime and his role in suppressing dissent and opposition have been widely criticized. Today, Rădulescu is remembered as a symbol of the complexities and contradictions of Romanian history, and his legacy continues to be debated by scholars and historians.\n\n# Notes\n\n# References", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Gogu_Rădulescu\" following this outline:\n\n#Biography\n##Early life and FSD\n##Wartime desertion and return\n##1952 fall and 1956 recovery\n##With Ceaușescu\n##Patronage and liberalism\n##Protochronism and austerity debates\n##Downfall, prosecution, and death\n#Legacy\n#Notes\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This article provides a chronology of the key events of the Later Crusades up to 1400, highlighting the major battles, sieges, and diplomatic maneuvers that shaped the course of these conflicts.\n\n# Chronologies of the Crusades in print\n\nThere are several chronologies of the Crusades that have been published over the years, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Some of the most notable include the works of historians such as Riley-Smith, Tyerman, and Asbridge, who have provided detailed and comprehensive accounts of the Crusades. However, it is worth noting that the chronology of the Later Crusades is not always straightforward, and different historians may have varying interpretations of the same events.\n\n# 13th century\n\n## Prior events\n\nThe 13th century saw the rise of the Ayyubid dynasty in Egypt and the Levant, which had a profound impact on the course of the Crusades. The Ayyubids were a powerful and well-organized Muslim state that was able to challenge the Crusader kingdoms in the region. In 1187, the Ayyubid leader Saladin conquered Jerusalem, which had been in Crusader hands since 1099. This event marked a significant turning point in the history of the Crusades, as it led to a renewed focus on the recapture of Jerusalem.\n\n## 1270\n\nIn 1270, the Eighth Crusade was launched by King Louis IX of France, who sailed to Tunis with a large army. The crusade was a disaster, as Louis died of disease shortly after arriving in Tunis, and the remainder of the army was forced to retreat.\n\n## 1280\n\nIn 1280, the Mamluk dynasty came to power in Egypt, marking the beginning of a new era in the history of the Crusades. The Mamluks were a powerful and well-organized Muslim state that would go on to play a major role in the conflicts of the 14th century.\n\n## 1290\n\nIn 1290, the Crusader kingdom of Acre was conquered by the Mamluks, marking the end of the Crusader presence in the Holy Land. This event had a profound impact on the course of the Crusades, as it led to a renewed focus on the recapture of the Holy Land.\n\n# 14th century\n\n## 1300\n\nIn 1300, the Ninth Crusade was launched by King Philip IV of France, who sailed to the Holy Land with a large army. The crusade was a failure, as Philip was forced to retreat due to a lack of support from the local Christian lords.\n\n## 1310\n\nIn 1310, the Knights Hospitaller, a Christian military order, conquered the island of Rhodes, which would go on to become a major base for their operations in the Mediterranean.\n\n## 1320\n\nIn 1320, the Mamluks launched a successful campaign against the Crusader kingdom of Cyprus, conquering the island and incorporating it into their empire.\n\n## 1330\n\nIn 1330, the Crusader kingdom of Armenia was conquered by the Mamluks, marking the end of the Crusader presence in the region.\n\n## 1340\n\nIn 1340, the Crusader kingdom of Antioch was conquered by the Mamluks, marking the end of the Crusader presence in the region.\n\n## 1350\n\nIn 1350, the Black Death, a pandemic that had begun in Europe, spread to the Middle East, causing widespread death and destruction.\n\n## 1360\n\nIn 1360, the Mamluks launched a successful campaign against the Crusader kingdom of Cilicia, conquering the region and incorporating it into their empire.\n\n## 1370\n\nIn 1370, the Crusader kingdom of Tripoli was conquered by the Mamluks, marking the end of the Crusader presence in the region.\n\n## 1380\n\nIn 1380, the Mamluks launched a successful campaign against the Crusader kingdom of Tyre, conquering the city and incorporating it into their empire.\n\n## 1390\n\nIn 1390, the Mamluks launched a successful campaign against the Crusader kingdom of Beirut, conquering the city and incorporating it into their empire.\n\n# 15th century\n\n## 1400\n\nIn 1400, the Mamluks launched a successful campaign against the Crusader kingdom of Sidon, conquering the city and incorporating it into their empire.

The lying-in-state took place at Westminster Hall in London, England, from September 14 to September 19, 2022. The queue, which became a major event in itself, was a testament to the widespread outpouring of grief and respect for the Queen.\n\n#Precedents\n\nThe queue for the lying-in-state of Elizabeth II was not the first of its kind. When Queen Victoria died in 1901, thousands of people lined up to pay their respects to her body lying in state at Westminster Hall. Similarly, when King George VI died in 1952, a large crowd gathered to pay their respects to his body lying in state at Westminster Hall. However, the queue for Queen Elizabeth II's lying-in-state was significantly larger and more extensive than any previous ones.\n\n#Routes\n\nThe queue for the lying-in-state of Elizabeth II followed a designated route through central London. The route was carefully planned and managed by the authorities to ensure the safe and orderly movement of the large crowd.\n\n##Main queue\n\nThe main queue started at Albert Embankment on the south bank of the River Thames and wound its way along the river to Westminster Bridge. From there, it continued along Whitehall and into Parliament Square, before turning into Westminster Hall. The queue was approximately 5 miles (8 kilometers) long and took several hours to complete.\n\n##Accessible queue\n\nTo accommodate people with disabilities and mobility issues, an accessible queue was set up. This queue started at a designated accessible entry point near Westminster Bridge and joined the main queue at a designated point near Parliament Square. The accessible queue was shorter and more manageable, with seating and refreshments provided along the way.\n\n#Length\n\nThe queue for the lying-in-state of Elizabeth II was incredibly long, with estimates suggesting that it stretched for over 5 miles (8 kilometers) at its peak. The queue was so long that it took many hours to complete, with some people waiting for over 24 hours to pay their respects to the Queen.\n\n#Organisation\n\nThe queue was carefully managed and organized by the authorities, with a large team of staff and volunteers on hand to ensure the safe and orderly movement of the crowd. The queue was divided into sections, with each section being managed by a team of staff and volunteers. The queue was also equipped with amenities such as toilets, refreshments, and seating areas.\n\n##Exemptions from queuing\n\nSome people were exempt from queuing, including those with disabilities and mobility issues, who were able to use the accessible queue. Others, such as members of the armed forces and emergency services, were also exempt from queuing. Additionally, some people were able to avoid queuing by attending special viewing sessions, which were held at designated times for specific groups, such as schoolchildren and community groups.\n\n#Participation and incidents\n\nThe queue for the lying-in-state of Elizabeth II was a major event, with thousands of people participating. Despite the large crowd, the queue was generally well-behaved and orderly, with few incidents reported. However, there were some reports of people pushing in and trying to jump the queue, which were quickly dealt with by the authorities.

Davis restructuring\n##Headquarters\n#See also\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Gulf and Western Industries\n==========================\n\nGulf and Western Industries was an American conglomerate that dominated the global economy during the mid-20th century. With a diverse portfolio of companies across various industries, Gulf and Western played a significant role in shaping the business landscape of the United States. This article provides an overview of the company's history, highlighting key events, mergers, and leadership that contributed to its growth and eventual restructuring.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### Bluhdorn period\n\nGulf and Western Industries was founded in 1934 as a small holding company by Charles Bluhdorn, a Czech-born entrepreneur. Initially, the company focused on acquiring and managing struggling businesses, leveraging Bluhdorn's expertise in finance and operations. During the 1950s and 1960s, Gulf and Western expanded its portfolio through strategic acquisitions, including the purchase of the Studebaker-Packard Corporation in 1958. This move marked a significant milestone in the company's history, as it gained control of the Studebaker automobile brand and a substantial stake in the automotive industry.\n\nThroughout the 1960s, Gulf and Western continued to grow through a series of acquisitions, including the purchase of the Kayser-Roth apparel company, the Simmons mattress company, and the Paramount Pictures film studio. Under Bluhdorn's leadership, the company's revenue and market value increased significantly, earning him a reputation as a shrewd businessman and deal-maker.\n\n### Early 1980s\n\nThe early 1980s marked a period of significant change for Gulf and Western. In 1980, the company divested its stake in the Studebaker automobile brand, selling it to the Volkswagen Group. This move marked a strategic shift away from the automotive industry and towards more profitable ventures. During this period, Gulf and Western also began to focus on its core businesses, including Paramount Pictures, which had become a major contributor to the company's revenue.\n\nIn 1983, Gulf and Western acquired the Madison Square Garden Corporation, adding the iconic New York City landmark to its portfolio. This move marked a significant expansion into the sports and entertainment industry, positioning the company for future growth.\n\n### Martin S. Davis restructuring\n\nIn 1983, Martin S. Davis, a veteran executive, succeeded Charles Bluhdorn as CEO of Gulf and Western. Under Davis's leadership, the company underwent a significant restructuring, aimed at streamlining operations and improving profitability. During this period, Gulf and Western divested several underperforming businesses, including the Kayser-Roth apparel company and the Simmons mattress company.\n\nIn 1989, Davis led the company's acquisition of the Viacom television network, a move that marked a significant expansion into the media industry. This acquisition positioned Gulf and Western as a major player in the global media landscape, with a portfolio of television networks, film studios, and publishing companies.\n\n### Headquarters\n\nGulf and Western's headquarters were located in New York City, where the company maintained a significant presence throughout its history. The company's executive offices were located in the Paramount Communications Building, a iconic skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan. The building served as a symbol of the company's power and influence, and was often referred to as the \"Gulf and Western Building.\"\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Paramount Pictures\n* Viacom\n* Madison Square Garden Corporation\n* Charles Bluhdorn\n* Martin S.

From the earliest indigenous tribes to the present day, Taiwan has been influenced by various cultures, including Chinese, Dutch, Spanish, Japanese, and American. This article provides an overview of the major events and periods in Taiwan's history.\n\n# Prehistory\n\nThe earliest human habitation in Taiwan dates back to around 20,000 to 30,000 years ago, during the Paleolithic era. Archaeological evidence suggests that the island was inhabited by various indigenous tribes, including the Amis, Atayal, Bunun, and Paiwan. These tribes developed complex societies, with their own languages, cultures, and traditions. They lived by hunting, gathering, and farming, and were skilled craftsmen, making tools and textiles.\n\n# Chinese contact and settlement\n\nThe first recorded Chinese contact with Taiwan was in 239 AD, during the Three Kingdoms period. Chinese fishermen and traders visited the island, and some settled there. However, it was not until the 17th century that large-scale Chinese settlement began. The Chinese brought with them new technologies, such as iron tools and firearms, which had a significant impact on the indigenous population.\n\n## Contact and establishment\n\nIn the early 17th century, Chinese pirates and traders began to establish settlements on the island. The most notable of these was Zheng Zhilong, a pirate-turned-privateer who established a base on Taiwan in 1625. Zheng's son, Zheng Chenggong (also known as Koxinga), would later play a significant role in Taiwanese history.\n\n## Piracy\n\nPiracy was a major problem in the waters around Taiwan during the 17th century. Chinese pirates, as well as Japanese and European pirates, preyed on ships passing through the Taiwan Strait. The Dutch and Spanish, who established colonies on the island, also engaged in piracy.\n\n## Japanese trade\n\nDuring the 17th century, Japan and Taiwan had significant trade relations. Japanese merchants traded with the indigenous population and the Chinese settlers, exchanging goods such as silk, porcelain, and silver.\n\n## Spanish Formosa\n\nIn 1626, the Spanish established a colony on Taiwan, which they called Formosa. The Spanish built forts and churches, and introduced Christianity to the island. However, their rule was short-lived, and they were expelled by the Dutch in 1642.\n\n## Dutch colonization\n\nIn 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a colony on Taiwan, which they called Fort Zeelandia. The Dutch built forts, churches, and schools, and introduced Western education and culture to the island.

However, after his defeat, he retreated to Taiwan, where he established a Ming-style government.\n\n## Sinicization\n\nDuring the Kingdom of Tungning period, Taiwan underwent significant sinicization. Chinese culture, language, and customs were introduced, and the indigenous population was assimilated into Chinese society.\n\n## Shi Lang\n\nIn 1681, the Qing dynasty sent a naval expedition to Taiwan, led by Admiral Shi Lang. Shi Lang defeated the Kingdom of Tungning forces, and the kingdom was annexed by the Qing dynasty.\n\n## End of Zheng rule\n\nThe Kingdom of Tungning came to an end in 1683, when it was annexed by the Qing dynasty. Zheng Chenggong's descendants continued to play a significant role in Taiwanese politics, but the kingdom was eventually absorbed into the Qing empire.\n\n# Qing dynasty (1683–1895)\n\n## Annexation\n\nIn 1683, the Qing dynasty annexed Taiwan, and it became a province of the empire. The Qing government established a provincial administration, and introduced Chinese law and institutions.\n\n## Taiwan administration\n\nThe Qing government established a provincial administration in Taiwan, with its capital at Taipei. The administration was responsible for collecting taxes, maintaining law and order, and promoting economic development.\n\n## Settler expansion (1684–1795)\n\nDuring the 18th century, large numbers of Chinese settlers arrived on the island. They established their own communities, and developed a distinct Taiwanese identity.\n\n## Administrative expansion (1796–1874)\n\nDuring the 19th century, the Qing government expanded its administrative control over Taiwan. New prefectures and counties were established, and the island was divided into smaller administrative units.\n\n## Expansion in reaction to crises (1875–1895)\n\nDuring the late 19th century, Taiwan faced several crises, including the Opium Wars and the First Sino-Japanese War. In response, the Qing government expanded its administrative control over the island, and introduced new policies to promote economic development.\n\n## Rebellions\n\nDuring the Qing period, there were several rebellions on the island, including the Taiping Rebellion and the Taiwan Rebellion.\n\n## Invasions\n\nTaiwan was also invaded by foreign powers, including the French and the Japanese.\n\n## End of Qing rule\n\nIn 1895, Taiwan was ceded to Japan, and the Qing dynasty's rule came to an end.\n\n# Japanese Empire (1895–1945)\n\n## Armed resistance\n\nAfter the Japanese took control of Taiwan, there was armed resistance from the Taiwanese people.

They advocated for Taiwanese rights and autonomy, and opposed Japanese rule.\n\n## Assimilation movement\n\nDuring the Japanese period, there was an assimilation movement, which aimed to assimilate the Taiwanese people into Japanese culture.

The tenth season of the show premiered on March 13, 2016, and concluded on December 1, 2016. The season was hosted by Jorge Rial and produced by Endemol Argentina.\n\n# Format\n\nThe format of the show remained the same as in previous seasons. A group of contestants, known as \"HouseGuests,\" lived together in a specially designed house with cameras and microphones recording their every move, 24 hours a day. Each week, the HouseGuests competed in challenges and voted each other off the show. The last HouseGuest remaining won a cash prize.\n\n# HouseGuests\n\nThe tenth season of Gran Hermano featured a diverse group of 20 HouseGuests. The contestants were from different parts of Argentina and had different backgrounds and personalities.\n\n## Relatives\n\nSome of the HouseGuests had relatives who were also contestants on the show. For example, HouseGuests Franco and Gonzalo were cousins. This added an extra layer of complexity to the show, as the relatives had to navigate their relationships with each other while competing against each other.\n\n# Episodes\n\nThe tenth season of Gran Hermano consisted of 240 episodes, which were broadcast from March 13, 2016, to December 1, 2016. The episodes were divided into different types, including nomination episodes, eviction episodes, and special episodes.\n\n# Voting history\n\nThe voting history of the show is a record of how the HouseGuests voted each other off the show. The HouseGuests voted in a nomination ceremony each week, and the two HouseGuests with the most votes were nominated for eviction. The public then voted to save one of the nominated HouseGuests, and the other was evicted.\n\n## Notes\n\nThe voting history of the show is subject to change due to twists and surprises. For example, some weeks the HouseGuests were given the power to save a nominated HouseGuest, while other weeks the public's vote was nullified.\n\n# Production\n\nThe production of Gran Hermano is a complex and elaborate process. The show is produced by Endemol Argentina, and the production team includes a range of professionals, from producers and directors to camera operators and editors.\n\n## Development\n\nThe development of the show began several months before the premiere. The production team worked to select the HouseGuests, design the house, and plan the challenges and twists.\n\n## Prize\n\nThe winner of Gran Hermano received a cash prize of 1 million pesos. The prize was awarded to the last HouseGuest remaining in the house.\n\n## Production design\n\nThe production design of the show is an important aspect of the overall production. The house was designed to be a comfortable and functional living space for the HouseGuests, while also providing a range of challenges and obstacles.\n\n# Release\n\nThe tenth season of Gran Hermano was released in 2016. The show was broadcast on television and streamed online.\n\n## Broadcast\n\nThe show was broadcast on Telefe, a popular Argentine television network. The episodes were broadcast from March 13, 2016, to December 1, 2016.\n\n## Streaming services\n\nThe show was also streamed online on the Telefe website and on other streaming services, such as Pluto TV.\n\n# Reception\n\nThe tenth season of Gran Hermano was a ratings success. The show was watched by millions of viewers each week, and the finale was one of the most-watched television episodes of the year.\n\n## Ratings\n\nThe ratings for the show were strong throughout the season. The show averaged a rating of 10.5 points per episode, with some episodes reaching as high as 15 points.\n\n### Debate episodes\n\nThe debate episodes were some of the highest-rated episodes of the season. These episodes featured the HouseGuests discussing and debating various topics, and were often tense and dramatic.\n\n### Night of the Exes episodes\n\nThe Night of the Exes episodes were a series of special episodes that featured the HouseGuests being reunited with their ex-partners. These episodes were highly anticipated and were some of the highest-rated episodes of the season.\n\n### Pluto TV Presents: Spying the House episodes\n\nThe Pluto TV Presents: Spying the House episodes were a series of special episodes that featured the HouseGuests being spied on by the public. These episodes were popular and added an extra layer of complexity to the show.\n\n#### Episodes 1–100\n\nThe first 100 episodes of the season were a mix of nomination episodes, eviction episodes, and special episodes. The HouseGuests were still getting to know each other, and the dynamics of the house were still being established.\n\n#### Episodes 101–200\n\nThe next 100 episodes of the season saw the HouseGuests competing in challenges and voting each other off the show. The dynamics of the house were becoming more established, and alliances were being formed.\n\n#### Episodes 201–240\n\nThe final 40 episodes of the season saw the HouseGuests competing in the final challenges and voting each other off the show. The dynamics of the house were intense, and the competition was fierce.\n\n# Notes\n\nThe tenth season of Gran Hermano was a complex and dramatic season.

It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, founded on democratic principles and shaped by a strong tradition of individualism and innovation. Located in North America, the United States is bordered by Canada to the north, Mexico to the south, the Atlantic Ocean to the east, and the Pacific Ocean to the west. With a population of over 331 million people, it is the third most populous country in the world.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe name \"United States of America\" was first used in the Declaration of Independence, adopted on July 4, 1776. The term \"America\" comes from the Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci, who was the first European to recognize the New World as a separate continent. The name \"United States\" was chosen to reflect the unity of the thirteen colonies that declared independence from Great Britain.\n\n**History**\n\n### Indigenous peoples\n\nThe first human habitation of the Americas dates back to at least 15,000 years ago, with various Native American tribes developing complex societies and cultures across the continent. There were over 500 distinct Native American tribes, each with their own languages, customs, and traditions.\n\n### European settlement and conflict (1607–1765)\n\nThe first successful English colony was established at Jamestown, Virginia in 1607. Over the next several decades, English, Spanish, French, and Dutch colonies were established along the eastern seaboard. The early colonial period was marked by conflict between Native American tribes and European settlers, as well as between rival European powers.\n\n### American Revolution and the early republic (1765–1800)\n\nTensions between the colonies and Great Britain led to the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War in 1775. The Continental Army, led by George Washington, defeated the British at Yorktown in 1781, securing independence for the United States. The Constitution, adopted in 1787, established a federal system of government and enshrined the principles of democracy and individual rights.\n\n### Westward expansion and Civil War (1800–1865)\n\nThe United States expanded its territory through the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 and the Mexican-American War of 1846–1848. The issue of slavery became increasingly divisive, culminating in the Civil War of 1861–1865. The Union, led by President Abraham Lincoln, ultimately prevailed over the Confederacy, abolishing slavery and preserving the unity of the nation.\n\n### Post–Civil War era (1865–1917)\n\nThe late 19th and early 20th centuries saw rapid industrialization, urbanization, and immigration in the United States. The country emerged as a global economic and military power, with the Spanish-American War of 1898 marking the beginning of its rise as a world power.\n\n### Rise as a superpower (1917–1945)\n\nThe United States entered World War I in 1917 and played a significant role in the Allied victory. The Roaring Twenties saw a period of economic prosperity and cultural transformation, followed by the Great Depression of the 1930s. The United States played a leading role in the Allied victory in World War II, emerging as one of the world's two superpowers.\n\n### Cold War (1945–1991)\n\nThe post-war period saw the emergence of the Cold War, a decades-long conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union. The United States played a leading role in the formation of the United Nations and the development of the European Union, while also engaging in a series of proxy wars and espionage operations against the Soviet Union.\n\n### Contemporary (1991–present)\n\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 marked the end of the Cold War and the beginning of a new era of global politics. The United States has continued to play a leading role in international affairs, with a focus on counter-terrorism, economic globalization, and the promotion of democracy and human rights.\n\n**Geography**\n\n### Climate\n\nThe United States has a diverse climate, ranging from tropical in Hawaii and Florida to polar in Alaska. The country is prone to natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes, and earthquakes.\n\n### Biodiversity and conservation\n\nThe United States is home to a wide range of ecosystems, including forests, grasslands, deserts, and wetlands. The country has a number of national parks and wildlife refuges, and is home to a diverse range of wildlife, including bears, wolves, and eagles.\n\n**Government and politics**\n\n### National government\n\nThe federal government is divided into three branches: the legislative, executive, and judicial. The President serves as head of state and government, while Congress is responsible for lawmaking. The Supreme Court is the highest court in the land, with the power to interpret the Constitution and federal laws.\n\n### Political parties\n\nThe United States has a two-party system, with the Democratic and Republican parties dominating national politics. There are also several smaller parties, including the Libertarian Party and the Green Party.\n\n### Subdivisions\n\nThe United States is divided into fifty states, each with its own government and laws.

Born on January 6, 1412, in the village of Domremy, Joan's life was marked by a series of extraordinary events that have become legendary in French history.\n\nName\n-----\n\nJoan of Arc's birth name was Jehanne d'Arc, which translates to \"Joan of Arc\" in English. She was also known as \"La Pucelle d'Orléans\" or \"The Maid of Orléans,\" a nickname that referred to her role in liberating the city of Orléans from the English siege.\n\nBirth and Historical Background\n---------------------------------\n\nJoan of Arc was born in the village of Domremy, which is located in the northeastern part of France. At the time of her birth, France was in the midst of the Hundred Years' War, a conflict that had begun in 1337 and would last for another 75 years. The war was fought between the English and the French, with the English seeking to claim the French throne. The war had a devastating impact on France, causing widespread destruction and economic hardship.\n\nEarly Life\n------------\n\nJoan of Arc grew up in a peasant family and was raised in a devoutly Catholic household. Her father, Jacques d'Arc, was a farmer who also served as a local official. Her mother, Isabelle Romée, was a homemaker who taught Joan how to spin, sew, and cook. Joan had three brothers and a sister, and the family lived a simple life in a small cottage.\n\nChinon\n--------\n\nIn 1429, at the age of 17, Joan traveled to the city of Chinon, where she petitioned Robert de Baudricourt, the garrison commander, for an escort to take her to the French court at Chinon. She claimed to have received visions from God that instructed her to drive the English out of France and crown the Dauphin, Charles VII, as the rightful king of France. Baudricourt was initially skeptical of Joan's claims, but eventually he was won over by her conviction and determination.\n\nMilitary Campaigns\n-------------------\n\nJoan of Arc's military campaigns began in April 1429, when she led a small army to the city of Orléans, which had been under siege by the English for over a year. She arrived at the city on April 29 and quickly became a symbol of hope for the besieged inhabitants.\n\n### Orléans\n\nJoan of Arc's arrival at Orléans was met with skepticism by the city's defenders, who had been under siege for over a year. However, Joan quickly won them over with her bravery and determination. She led a series of successful attacks against the English, eventually forcing them to lift the siege on May 8, 1429.\n\n### Loire Campaign\n\nAfter the victory at Orléans, Joan of Arc led a campaign to drive the English out of the Loire Valley. She captured several key cities, including Jargeau, Meung-sur-Loire, and Beaugency. The campaign was marked by a series of victories, but also by a serious injury that Joan suffered at the siege of Jargeau.\n\n### Coronation and Siege of Paris\n\nIn July 1429, Joan of Arc led the French army to the city of Reims, where Charles VII was crowned as the rightful king of France. The coronation was a major victory for Joan and the French, but it was followed by a series of setbacks. The French army was defeated at the siege of Paris, and Joan was captured by the English on May 23, 1430.\n\n### Campaign against Perrinet Gressart\n\nIn the spring of 1430, Joan of Arc led a campaign against Perrinet Gressart, a French nobleman who had allied himself with the English. The campaign was marked by a series of victories, but it was ultimately unsuccessful. Joan was captured by the English on May 23, 1430.\n\n### Siege of Compiègne and Capture\n\nIn May 1430, Joan of Arc led a small army to the city of Compiègne, which was under siege by the English. The siege was unsuccessful, and Joan was captured by the English on May 23, 1430.\n\nTrials and Execution\n---------------------\n\nJoan of Arc was put on trial by the English, who accused her of heresy and witchcraft. The trial was a sham, and Joan was denied the right to a fair defense.\n\n### Trial\n\nThe trial of Joan of Arc began on February 21, 1431, and lasted for several months. Joan was interrogated by a panel of church officials and lawyers, who sought to extract a confession from her. She was denied the right to a lawyer and was subjected to physical and emotional abuse.\n\n### Execution\n\nJoan of Arc was executed by burning at the stake on May 30, 1431. The execution was carried out in the market square of Rouen, and it was witnessed by a large crowd. Joan's death was a tragic event that shocked the French people and cemented her place as a national heroine.\n\n### Aftermath and Rehabilitation Trial\n\nIn the years following Joan's execution, there was a growing movement to clear her name and rehabilitate her reputation. In 1456, a rehabilitation trial was held, and Joan was declared innocent of the charges against her. The trial was a major victory for Joan's supporters, and it paved the way for her canonization as a saint.\n\nVisions\n--------\n\nJoan of Arc claimed to have received visions from God that instructed her to drive the English out of France and crown the Dauphin, Charles VII, as the rightful king of France. Her visions were a central part of her identity and her mission, and they played a key role in her military campaigns.\n\nClothing\n---------\n\nJoan of Arc wore men's clothing, which was a common practice among women who served in the military during the Middle Ages. She wore a suit of armor and carried a sword, and she was known for her bravery and her military skills.\n\nLegacy\n--------\n\nJoan of Arc's legacy is complex and multifaceted. She is remembered as a military leader and a symbol of France, but she is also revered as a saint and a heroic woman.\n\n### Military Leader and Symbol of France\n\nJoan of Arc is remembered as a brilliant military leader who played a key role in the French victory over the English. She is a symbol of French patriotism and a reminder of the country's rich history and cultural heritage.\n\n### Saint and Heroic Woman\n\nJoan of Arc is revered as a saint and a heroic woman who embodied the values of courage, determination, and faith. She is a role model for women around the world, and her legacy continues to inspire and empower people to this day.\n\nSee Also\n----------\n\n* Hundred Years' War\n* Charles VII of France\n* Robert de Baudricourt\n* Perrinet Gressart\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n### Notes\n\n* This article is based on a variety of sources, including historical accounts, biographies, and scholarly articles.\n\n### Citations\n\n* None\n\n### Sources\n\n* None\n\nExternal Links\n---------------\n\n* None", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Joan_of_Arc\" following this outline:\n\n#Name\n#Birth and historical background\n#Early life\n#Chinon\n#Military campaigns\n##Orléans\n##Loire Campaign\n##Coronation and siege of Paris\n##Campaign against Perrinet Gressart\n##Siege of Compiègne and capture\n#Trials and execution\n##Trial\n##Execution\n##Aftermath and rehabilitation trial\n#Visions\n#Clothing\n#Legacy\n##Military leader and symbol of France\n##Saint and heroic woman\n#See also\n#References\n##Notes\n##Citations\n##Sources\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The dynasty is said to have ruled from the dawn of time to the rise of the Kayanian dynasty, and its stories have been preserved in various forms of Persian literature, including the Shahnameh and the works of the Muslim historian al-Tabari.\n\n# Origins, etymology and sources\n\nThe origins of the Pishdadian dynasty are shrouded in mystery, and different sources provide varying accounts of its beginnings. The name \"Pishdadian\" is believed to be derived from the Persian word \"pishdad,\" meaning \"benefactor\" or \" ancestor.\" The dynasty is said to have been founded by the mythical king Gayomart, who is described as the first ruler of the world.\n\nThe primary sources for the history of the Pishdadian dynasty are the Shahnameh, a epic poem written by Ferdowsi in the 10th century, and the works of the Muslim historian al-Tabari, who wrote in the 9th century. These sources provide a wealth of information about the kings of the Pishdadian dynasty, their deeds, and their struggles against various enemies.\n\n# The Shahnameh and Zoroastrian tradition\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Shahnameh is one of the most important sources for the history of the Pishdadian dynasty. Written by Ferdowsi in the 10th century, the epic poem provides a comprehensive account of the kings of the dynasty, from Gayomart to the rise of the Kayanians. The Shahnameh is based on earlier oral traditions and draws heavily from Zoroastrian mythology.\n\n## The kings\n\nThe Shahnameh describes the Pishdadian kings as heroic rulers who fought against various enemies, including the forces of darkness and chaos. The first king of the dynasty, Gayomart, is said to have been a wise and just ruler who established the foundations of civilization. He was succeeded by his son, Hoshang, who is credited with the discovery of fire and the establishment of agriculture.\n\nThe most famous king of the Pishdadian dynasty is probably Tahmuras, who is said to have ruled for 30 years and expanded the empire through conquest. He is also credited with the defeat of the demon king Ahriman, who had been terrorizing the world.\n\nOther notable kings of the Pishdadian dynasty include Jamshid, who is said to have been a wise and just ruler, and Fereydun, who is credited with the division of the world into four quarters.\n\n# Tabari and the Muslim narratives\n\n## The first Pishdadian kings and the conflict with Iblis\n\nThe works of al-Tabari provide an alternative account of the Pishdadian dynasty, one that is influenced by Islamic theology and mythology. According to Tabari, the first king of the dynasty was Gayomart, who is described as a righteous and just ruler. However, he is also said to have been deceived by the devil Iblis, who tempted him to disobey God's commands.\n\nThe conflict between Gayomart and Iblis is a recurring theme in Tabari's account of the Pishdadian dynasty. Iblis is described as a powerful and cunning enemy who seeks to destroy humanity and undermine the authority of the Pishdadian kings.\n\n## From Jam al-Shidh to Zaw: al-Dahhak and war with the Turks\n\nTabari's account of the Pishdadian dynasty also includes a detailed description of the wars fought by the kings against various enemies, including the Turks. One of the most famous kings of the dynasty is al-Dahhak, who is said to have ruled for 1,000 years and fought against the Turks and other enemies.\n\nAl-Dahhak is described as a powerful and wise ruler who expanded the empire through conquest. However, he is also said to have been corrupted by power and greed, and his reign was marked by tyranny and oppression.\n\n# Significance\n\nThe Pishdadian dynasty plays a significant role in Persian mythology and literature. The stories of the kings and their deeds have been preserved in various forms of literature, including the Shahnameh and the works of al-Tabari.\n\nThe Pishdadian dynasty is also important for its historical significance. The kings of the dynasty are said to have established the foundations of civilization and fought against various enemies to protect their people.\n\n# Notes\n\nThe Pishdadian dynasty is a legendary royal house that is said to have ruled from the dawn of time to the rise of the Kayanian dynasty. The stories of the kings and their deeds have been preserved in various forms of Persian literature, including the Shahnameh and the works of al-Tabari.\n\n# References\n\nNone\n\n# Bibliography\n\n## Translations of original sources\n\n* Ferdowsi.

The storm caused significant damage and disruption, particularly in Japan and the Korean Peninsula. This article provides an overview of the storm's meteorological history, as well as its impact and aftermath in the affected regions.\n\n# Meteorological history\n\nTyphoon Khanun formed as a tropical depression on August 3, 2023, in the western Pacific Ocean, approximately 1,000 km (620 miles) southeast of Okinawa, Japan. The depression gradually intensified, becoming a tropical storm on August 4 and a typhoon on August 5. Khanun's intensification was fueled by warm ocean waters and a favorable atmospheric environment.\n\nThroughout August 5-6, Khanun continued to strengthen, reaching its peak intensity as a Category 4-equivalent typhoon on August 6. At this time, the storm had maximum sustained winds of 215 km/h (134 mph) and a central pressure of 935 hPa (27.61 inHg). Khanun's large eye, measuring approximately 40 km (25 miles) in diameter, was visible on satellite imagery.\n\nAs Khanun approached the Japanese archipelago, it began to interact with the island of Kyushu, causing the storm to weaken slightly. However, Khanun remained a powerful typhoon as it made landfall on August 7, bringing heavy rainfall and strong winds to the region.\n\n# Preparations, impact, and aftermath\n\n## Japan\n\nIn anticipation of Khanun's landfall, the Japanese government issued numerous warnings and advisories, including a typhoon warning for the southern island of Kyushu. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) predicted that Khanun would bring heavy rainfall and strong winds, potentially causing widespread damage and disruption.\n\nOn August 7, Khanun made landfall on Kyushu, bringing sustained winds of up to 180 km/h (112 mph) and heavy rainfall. The storm caused significant damage to buildings, infrastructure, and agriculture, particularly in the prefectures of Fukuoka, Saga, and Nagasaki.\n\nAccording to official reports, Khanun caused 12 fatalities and over 200 injuries in Japan. The storm also left thousands of homes without power, with many residents forced to evacuate due to flooding and landslides.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, the Japanese government deployed emergency responders and relief teams to affected areas. The government also established a task force to coordinate relief efforts and provide support to affected residents.\n\n## Korean Peninsula\n\nAs Khanun approached the Korean Peninsula, the Korean Meteorological Administration (KMA) issued warnings and advisories for the southern regions of South Korea. The KMA predicted that Khanun would bring heavy rainfall and strong winds, potentially causing flooding and damage to infrastructure.\n\nOn August 8, Khanun made landfall on the southern coast of South Korea, bringing sustained winds of up to 150 km/h (93 mph) and heavy rainfall. The storm caused significant damage to buildings, infrastructure, and agriculture, particularly in the provinces of South Gyeongsang and South Jeolla.\n\nAccording to official reports, Khanun caused 5 fatalities and over 100 injuries in South Korea. The storm also left thousands of homes without power, with many residents forced to evacuate due to flooding and landslides.\n\nIn North Korea, the storm caused significant damage to crops and infrastructure, particularly in the provinces of South Hamgyong and Ryanggang. However, the full extent of the damage and casualties is unknown due to limited reporting from the North Korean government.\n\n## Elsewhere\n\nIn addition to Japan and the Korean Peninsula, Khanun also affected other countries in East Asia, including China and Taiwan. In China, the storm caused significant damage to agriculture and infrastructure, particularly in the provinces of Fujian and Guangdong. In Taiwan, the storm brought heavy rainfall and strong winds, causing flooding and damage to infrastructure.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of tropical cyclones in 2023\n* Typhoon season in Japan\n* Typhoon season in Korea\n\n# References\n\n# External links\n\n* Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA)\n* Korean Meteorological Administration (KMA)\n* China Meteorological Administration (CMA)\n* Taiwan Central Weather Bureau (CWB)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Typhoon_Khanun_(2023)\" following this outline:\n\n#Meteorological history\n#Preparations, impact, and aftermath\n##Japan\n##Korean Peninsula\n##Elsewhere\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The counteroffensive marked a significant turning point in the war, as Ukrainian forces achieved a major breakthrough and pushed Russian troops back, recapturing large swaths of territory.\n\n# Background\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine began on February 24, 2022, with Russian forces advancing on multiple fronts, including the Kharkiv Oblast. By March 2022, Russian forces had captured large parts of the oblast, including the city of Izyum, and had pushed Ukrainian forces back to the west bank of the Oskil River. The front lines stabilized, with both sides dug in and engaging in artillery duels.\n\n# Prelude\n\nIn the months leading up to the counteroffensive, Ukrainian forces had been preparing for a major operation. They had been conducting reconnaissance missions, gathering intelligence on Russian troop movements and positions, and stockpiling supplies and equipment. The Ukrainian military had also been receiving significant amounts of military aid from Western countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada.\n\n# Counteroffensive\n\nThe counteroffensive began on September 6, 2022, with Ukrainian forces launching a surprise attack on Russian positions in the Kharkiv Oblast. The initial advance was rapid, with Ukrainian forces quickly breaking through Russian lines and pushing deep into Russian-held territory.\n\n## First phase (6–12 September 2022)\n\n### Initial advance\n\nThe initial advance was marked by a series of rapid gains, with Ukrainian forces capturing key towns and villages, including the strategic town of Balakliia. Russian forces were caught off guard, and their defenses were quickly overwhelmed.\n\n### Breakthrough\n\nOn September 8, 2022, Ukrainian forces achieved a major breakthrough, capturing the town of Kupyansk and pushing Russian forces back to the east bank of the Oskil River. The breakthrough marked a significant turning point in the battle, as Ukrainian forces were now able to advance on multiple fronts.\n\n### Russian withdrawal from Kharkiv Oblast west of Oskil River\n\nAs Ukrainian forces advanced, Russian forces began to withdraw from the Kharkiv Oblast west of the Oskil River. The withdrawal was chaotic, with Russian troops abandoning equipment and supplies as they fled.\n\n### Other gains and casualties\n\nOver the next few days, Ukrainian forces continued to make gains, capturing key towns and villages, including the town of Izyum. The battle was marked by significant casualties on both sides, with reports of heavy fighting and artillery duels.\n\n## Battle of Shevchenkove\n\nThe Battle of Shevchenkove was a key part of the counteroffensive, as Ukrainian forces sought to capture the strategic town of Shevchenkove. The battle was marked by heavy fighting, with both sides suffering significant casualties. On September 10, 2022, Ukrainian forces captured the town, marking a significant victory.\n\n## Second phase (13 September–1 October 2022)\n\n### Oskil River crossing\n\nOn September 13, 2022, Ukrainian forces launched a major operation to cross the Oskil River and capture the town of Lyman. The operation was marked by significant fighting, with both sides suffering heavy casualties.\n\n### Encirclement and recapture of Lyman\n\nOn September 30, 2022, Ukrainian forces encircled the town of Lyman, cutting off Russian supply lines and trapping Russian forces. On October 1, 2022, Ukrainian forces recaptured the town, marking a significant victory.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## Russia\n\nThe Russian government was caught off guard by the Ukrainian counteroffensive, and their initial response was marked by confusion and disarray. As the extent of the Ukrainian gains became clear, the Russian government began to issue statements denying the scale of the losses and blaming Ukrainian forces for the ongoing fighting.\n\n## Worldwide\n\nThe international community responded to the counteroffensive with a mixture of surprise and relief. Western countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, issued statements supporting the Ukrainian government and condemning Russian aggression.\n\n# Aftermath of the first phase\n\n## Mass graves and evidence of torture\n\nIn the aftermath of the first phase of the counteroffensive, Ukrainian forces discovered mass graves and evidence of torture in areas previously held by Russian forces. The discoveries sparked widespread outrage and condemnation.\n\n## Military decorations\n\nUkrainian forces who took part in the counteroffensive were awarded military decorations, including the Order of Bohdan Khmelnytsky and the Medal for Military Service to Ukraine.\n\n## Effect on Russian referendums\n\nThe counteroffensive had a significant impact on Russian plans to hold referendums in occupied areas of Ukraine. The referendums, which were widely seen as illegitimate, were postponed indefinitely.\n\n## Captured Russian equipment\n\nUkrainian forces captured significant amounts of Russian equipment, including tanks, artillery pieces, and small arms. The captured equipment was displayed publicly, marking a significant propaganda victory for the Ukrainian government.\n\n# Aftermath of the second phase\n\nThe aftermath of the second phase of the counteroffensive saw Ukrainian forces consolidating their gains and preparing for further operations. The Russian government continued to deny the scale of their losses, while the international community continued to condemn Russian aggression.\n\n# See also\n\n* 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* Battle of Kharkiv\n* Eastern Ukraine campaign\n\n# Notes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Kharkiv_counteroffensive\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Prelude\n#Counteroffensive\n##First phase (6–12 September 2022)\n###Initial advance\n###Breakthrough\n###Russian withdrawal from Kharkiv Oblast west of Oskil River\n###Other gains and casualties\n##Battle of Shevchenkove\n##Second phase (13 September–1 October 2022)\n###Oskil River crossing\n###Encirclement and recapture of Lyman\n#Reactions\n##Russia\n##Worldwide\n#Aftermath of the first phase\n##Mass graves and evidence of torture\n##Military decorations\n##Effect on Russian referendums\n##Captured Russian equipment\n#Aftermath of the second phase\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The rebellion was led by Yevgeny Prigozhin, the leader of the Wagner Group, a Russian private military company (PMC) that had been involved in various military conflicts around the world, including the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\n### Yevgeny Prigozhin and the Wagner Group\n\nYevgeny Prigozhin is a Russian businessman and mercenary who founded the Wagner Group in 2014. The group was initially composed of veterans of the Russian military and security services, and was known for its involvement in various conflicts in the Middle East and Africa. Prigozhin was a close associate of Russian President Vladimir Putin, and the Wagner Group was widely seen as a tool of Russian foreign policy.\n\n### Internal tensions during the invasion of Ukraine\n\nDuring the invasion of Ukraine, which began in February 2022, the Wagner Group played a significant role in the fighting, particularly in the Donbas region. However, tensions began to rise within the group, particularly between Prigozhin and the Russian Ministry of Defense (MOD). Prigozhin was critical of the MOD's handling of the war, and accused them of failing to provide adequate support to the Wagner Group.\n\n### Order to integrate Wagner\n\nIn April 2023, the MOD announced that the Wagner Group would be integrated into the Russian military, a move that was seen as an attempt to bring the group under greater control. Prigozhin was strongly opposed to this move, and saw it as a threat to the independence and autonomy of the Wagner Group.\n\n### Planning the rebellion\n\nIn the months leading up to the rebellion, Prigozhin and his allies within the Wagner Group began to secretly plan a coup against the Russian government. The exact details of this planning are not known, but it is believed that Prigozhin and his allies were in contact with other groups and individuals who were opposed to the Russian government.\n\nRebellion\n---------\n\n### Prigozhin's statements\n\nOn June 23, 2023, Prigozhin made a series of statements on social media, in which he rebuked the Russian government and accused them of attacking the Wagner Group. He also called for a rebellion against the government, and announced that the Wagner Group would be marching on Moscow.\n\n### Rebukes of the government and allegation of an attack on Wagner\n\nIn his statements, Prigozhin accused the Russian government of corruption and incompetence, and claimed that they had been trying to destroy the Wagner Group. He also alleged that the government had launched a missile attack on a Wagner Group base in Ukraine, which had killed several members of the group.\n\n### Call to rebellion\n\nPrigozhin's statements were seen as a call to rebellion, and were widely shared on social media. Many people in Russia and around the world were shocked by the sudden turn of events, and were unsure of what to make of Prigozhin's claims.\n\n### Capture of Rostov-on-Don\n\nOn June 23, 2023, the Wagner Group captured the city of Rostov-on-Don, which is located in southern Russia. The city is a major transportation hub, and is home to a large military base. The capture of the city was seen as a significant blow to the Russian government, and marked the beginning of the rebellion.\n\n### Advance towards Moscow\n\nAfter capturing Rostov-on-Don, the Wagner Group began to advance towards Moscow. The group's forces were met with resistance from Russian military units, but they were able to push forward and approach the outskirts of the city.\n\n### Security measures\n\nIn response to the rebellion, the Russian government imposed a state of emergency and deployed additional security forces to the streets. The government also shut down the internet and restricted travel to and from Moscow.\n\n### Events in Syria\n\nThe Wagner Group also has a presence in Syria, where they have been involved in the civil war. During the rebellion, there were reports of clashes between Wagner Group forces and Russian military units in Syria.\n\nResolution\n----------\n\nThe rebellion was short-lived, and was brought to an end on June 24, 2023, when Prigozhin and his allies agreed to a ceasefire. The exact terms of the ceasefire are not known, but it is believed that the Wagner Group was granted a degree of autonomy and independence.\n\nReactions\n---------\n\n### Domestic\n\nThe rebellion was met with a range of reactions within Russia. Many people were shocked and confused by the sudden turn of events, while others were supportive of Prigozhin and the Wagner Group.\n\n### Vladimir Putin's address\n\nOn June 24, 2023, Russian President Vladimir Putin made a televised address, in which he condemned the rebellion and promised to take action against those responsible.\n\n### Other government-aligned figures\n\nOther government-aligned figures, including politicians and military leaders, also condemned the rebellion and called for Prigozhin and his allies to be brought to justice.\n\n### Anti-war opposition and anti-government armed groups\n\nThe rebellion was also met with support from some anti-war opposition groups and anti-government armed groups. These groups saw the rebellion as an opportunity to challenge the Russian government and to bring about change.\n\n### Ultranationalists and milbloggers\n\nSome ultranationalists and milbloggers also supported the rebellion, seeing it as a way to defend Russia's interests and to promote a more aggressive foreign policy.\n\n### Wider public\n\nThe wider public in Russia was largely divided on the issue of the rebellion. Some people were supportive of Prigozhin and the Wagner Group, while others were opposed to the rebellion and saw it as a threat to stability and security.\n\n### International\n\nThe rebellion was also met with reactions from around the world. Many countries condemned the rebellion and called for calm, while others saw it as an opportunity to challenge Russian influence and to promote their own interests.\n\nAftermath\n----------\n\n### Fallout and restoring order\n\nIn the aftermath of the rebellion, the Russian government worked to restore order and to bring those responsible to justice. Prigozhin and his allies were granted a degree of autonomy and independence, but the Wagner Group was also subject to greater scrutiny and oversight.\n\n### Subsequent statements\n\nPrigozhin and other leaders of the Wagner Group made subsequent statements, in which they called for greater transparency and accountability within the Russian government. They also called for an end to corruption and for greater support for veterans and military families.\n\n### Fate of the Wagner Group and Yevgeny Prigozhin\n\nThe fate of the Wagner Group and Yevgeny Prigozhin is uncertain. The group has been subject to greater scrutiny and oversight, and Prigozhin has faced criticism and opposition from within Russia and around the world.\n\n### Closure of criminal case and initial statements\n\nIn July 2023, the Russian government announced that it had closed a criminal case against Prigozhin and the Wagner Group, citing a lack of evidence. Prigozhin and other leaders of the group made initial statements, in which they denied any wrongdoing and called for greater transparency and accountability within the Russian government.\n\n### Crackdown on Wagner, alleged purges and related arrests\n\nDespite the closure of the criminal case, the Russian government has continued to crack down on the Wagner Group, with reports of alleged purges and related arrests. The exact nature and extent of these actions is not known, but they are believed to be part of a broader effort to bring the group under greater control.\n\n### Prigozhin's return to Russia\n\nIn August 2023, Prigozhin returned to Russia, where he was met with a mixture of support and opposition. The exact circumstances of his return are not known, but it is believed that he was granted a degree of immunity and protection.\n\n### Death of Prigozhin and Utkin\n\nOn August 23, 2023, Prigozhin and Dmitry Utkin, a senior leader of the Wagner Group, were killed in a plane crash in Russia. The exact circumstances of the crash are not known, but it is believed that it was an accident.\n\nMeasures of NATO countries\n---------------------------\n\nIn response to the rebellion, NATO countries took a range of measures to strengthen their defenses and to challenge Russian influence. These measures included increased military spending, enhanced security cooperation, and greater support for Ukraine and other countries in the region.\n\nAnalysis\n----------\n\n### Political\n\nThe rebellion was a significant political event in Russia, highlighting deep divisions and tensions within the country. The exact causes and consequences of the rebellion are not yet fully understood, but it is clear that it marked a turning point in Russian politics.\n\n### Military\n\nThe rebellion also had significant military implications, highlighting the strength and weakness of the Russian military. The exact nature and extent of these implications is not yet fully understood, but it is clear that the rebellion marked a significant challenge to Russian military power and influence.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Wagner Group\n* Yevgeny Prigozhin\n* Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* Russian military intervention in Syria\n\nNotes\n-----\n\n* This article is based on a range of sources, including news reports, academic studies, and primary sources.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n* This article does not include citations or references.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Wagner_Group_rebellion\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Yevgeny Prigozhin and the Wagner Group\n##Internal tensions during the invasion of Ukraine\n###Order to integrate Wagner\n##Planning the rebellion\n#Rebellion\n##Prigozhin's statements\n###Rebukes of the government and allegation of an attack on Wagner\n###Call to rebellion\n##Capture of Rostov-on-Don\n##Advance towards Moscow\n##Security measures\n##Events in Syria\n#Resolution\n#Reactions\n##Domestic\n###Vladimir Putin's address\n###Other government-aligned figures\n###Anti-war opposition and anti-government armed groups\n###Ultranationalists and milbloggers\n###Wider public\n##International\n#Aftermath\n##Fallout and restoring order\n##Subsequent statements\n##Fate of the Wagner Group and Yevgeny Prigozhin\n###Closure of criminal case and initial statements\n###Crackdown on Wagner, alleged purges and related arrests\n###Prigozhin's return to Russia\n###Death of Prigozhin and Utkin\n##Measures of NATO countries\n#Analysis\n##Political\n##Military\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Nonmetals are found on the right-hand side of the periodic table and include elements such as carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine. They are often dull, brittle, and poor conductors of electricity. Nonmetals are essential components of many biological molecules, including proteins, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids.\n\nDefinition and applicable elements\n--------------------------------\n\nThe definition of a nonmetal is somewhat ambiguous, as there is no strict dividing line between metals and nonmetals. However, nonmetals are generally characterized by their lack of metallic properties, such as malleability and ductility. Nonmetals are also typically poor conductors of electricity and tend to form anions (negatively charged ions) when they react with other elements.\n\nThe following elements are commonly classified as nonmetals:\n\n* Carbon (C)\n* Nitrogen (N)\n* Oxygen (O)\n* Fluorine (F)\n* Neon (Ne)\n* Sodium is often considered a metal, but it can exhibit some nonmetallic properties under certain conditions.\n* Phosphorus (P)\n* Sulfur (S)\n* Chlorine (Cl)\n* Argon (Ar)\n* Selenium (Se)\n* Bromine (Br)\n* Krypton (Kr)\n* Iodine (I)\n* Xenon (Xe)\n\nGeneral properties\n-----------------\n\n### Physical\n\nNonmetals tend to have relatively low melting and boiling points compared to metals. They are often brittle and do not exhibit the same level of malleability as metals. Nonmetals can exist in various forms, including gases, liquids, and solids.\n\n#### Allotropes\n\nSome nonmetals, such as carbon and sulfur, can exist in multiple forms, known as allotropes. Allotropes are different physical forms of the same element, which can exhibit different properties. For example, diamond and graphite are both allotropes of carbon.\n\n### Chemical\n\nNonmetals tend to form covalent bonds with other nonmetals, rather than ionic bonds, which are more characteristic of metals. Nonmetals can also form anions (negatively charged ions) when they react with other elements.\n\n### Complications\n\nThere are several complications when it comes to defining and categorizing nonmetals.\n\n#### First row anomaly\n\nThe first row of the periodic table, which includes the elements hydrogen (H), helium (He), lithium (Li), beryllium (Be), boron (B), carbon (C), nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), and fluorine (F), is often referred to as the \"first row anomaly.\" These elements exhibit some unusual properties, such as hydrogen's ability to form both positive and negative ions.\n\n#### Secondary periodicity\n\nSecondary periodicity refers to the tendency of elements to exhibit similar properties when they are in the same group (vertical column) of the periodic table, but not necessarily in the same period (horizontal row). Nonmetals often exhibit secondary periodicity, which can make it difficult to predict their properties based solely on their position in the periodic table.\n\n#### Higher oxidation states\n\nNonmetals can exhibit higher oxidation states than metals, which can make them more reactive. For example, chlorine can exhibit an oxidation state of +7, while oxygen can exhibit an oxidation state of +2.\n\n#### Multiple bond formation\n\nNonmetals can form multiple bonds with other nonmetals, which can lead to the formation of complex molecules. For example, carbon can form double and triple bonds with other carbon atoms, which are essential for the formation of many biological molecules.\n\n#### Property overlaps\n\nThere is often overlap between the properties of metals and nonmetals, which can make it difficult to categorize elements as strictly metallic or nonmetallic. For example, some elements, such as boron and silicon, can exhibit both metallic and nonmetallic properties under different conditions.\n\nTypes\n------\n\n### Noble gases\n\nThe noble gases are a group of nonmetals that are found in the far right-hand column of the periodic table. They are typically unreactive and do not readily form compounds with other elements. The noble gases include:\n\n* Helium (He)\n* Neon (Ne)\n* Argon (Ar)\n* Krypton (Kr)\n* Xenon (Xe)\n* Radon (Rn)\n\n### Halogen nonmetals\n\nThe halogen nonmetals are a group of nonmetals that are found in the column to the left of the noble gases. They are typically highly reactive and readily form compounds with other elements. The halogen nonmetals include:\n\n* Fluorine (F)\n* Chlorine (Cl)\n* Bromine (Br)\n* Iodine (I)\n* Astatine (At)\n\n### Unclassified nonmetals\n\nThere are several nonmetals that do not fit neatly into the categories of noble gases or halogen nonmetals. These include:\n\n* Carbon (C)\n* Nitrogen (N)\n* Oxygen (O)\n* Phosphorus (P)\n* Sulfur (S)\n* Selenium (Se)\n\nAbundance, extraction, and uses\n-------------------------------\n\n### Abundance\n\nNonmetals are relatively abundant in the Earth's crust, although their abundance can vary widely depending on the specific element. For example, oxygen is the most abundant element in the Earth's crust, while fluorine is relatively rare.\n\n### Extraction\n\nNonmetals can be extracted from the Earth's crust through a variety of methods, including mining and electrolysis. For example, aluminum is often extracted from bauxite ore through electrolysis.\n\n### Uses\n\nNonmetals have a wide range of uses, including:\n\n* Biological molecules: Nonmetals, such as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, are essential components of many biological molecules, including proteins, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids.\n* Energy production: Nonmetals, such as uranium and thorium, are used in nuclear reactors to generate electricity.\n* Electronics: Nonmetals, such as silicon and germanium, are used in the production of semiconductors and other electronic components.\n* Medical applications: Nonmetals, such as oxygen and nitrogen, are used in medical applications, such as anesthesia and respiratory therapy.\n\nTaxonomical history\n-------------------\n\n### Background\n\nThe concept of nonmetals has a long history, dating back to the early days of chemistry. The ancient Greeks recognized that certain elements, such as sulfur and carbon, did not exhibit the same properties as metals.\n\n### Organization of elements by types\n\nIn the 18th century, chemists began to organize elements into different types, including metals and nonmetals. This organization was based on the properties of the elements, such as their reactivity and physical characteristics.\n\n### Development of types\n\nOver time, the concept of nonmetals has evolved and become more refined. In the 19th century, the discovery of new elements and the development of new analytical techniques led to a greater understanding of the properties of nonmetals.\n\n### Suggested distinguishing criteria\n\nThere are several criteria that have been suggested for distinguishing between metals and nonmetals, including:\n\n* Electrical conductivity: Metals are typically good conductors of electricity, while nonmetals are poor conductors.\n* Malleability: Metals are typically malleable, while nonmetals are brittle.\n* Reactivity: Metals are typically reactive, while nonmetals are less reactive.\n\nComparison of selected properties\n--------------------------------\n\n### Physical properties by element type\n\n| Element type | Melting point (°C) | Boiling point (°C) | Density (g/cm³) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metal | 660 (Al) - 3,380 (W) | 2,470 (Hg) - 5,800 (W) | 1.7 (Li) - 22.6 (Os) |\n| Nonmetal | -210 (N) - 3,500 (C) | -195 (N) - 4,000 (C) | 0.7 (H) - 6.2 (S) |\n\n### Chemical properties by element type\n\n| Element type | Reactivity | Ionization energy (eV) | Electron affinity (eV) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metal | High | 3.9 (Li) - 9.3 (Cs) | 0.5 (Li) - 2.5 (Cs) |\n| Nonmetal | Low | 10.4 (H) - 17.4 (He) | 0.7 (H) - 3.3 (He) |\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Metal\n* Periodic table\n* Chemistry\n* Physics\n\nNotes\n------\n\nThis article uses the IUPAC definition of a nonmetal, which is based on the element's lack of metallic properties.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nThis article does not include any references.\n\nExternal links\n---------------\n\n* IUPAC definition of a nonmetal\n* Periodic table of elements\n* Chemistry online resources", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Nonmetal\" following this outline:\n\n#Definition and applicable elements\n#General properties\n##Physical\n###Allotropes\n##Chemical\n##Complications\n###First row anomaly\n###Secondary periodicity\n###Higher oxidation states\n###Multiple bond formation\n###Property overlaps\n#Types\n##Noble gases\n##Halogen nonmetals\n##Unclassified nonmetals\n#Abundance, extraction, and uses\n##Abundance\n##Extraction\n##Uses\n#Taxonomical history\n##Background\n##Organization of elements by types\n##Development of types\n##Suggested distinguishing criteria\n#Comparison of selected properties\n##Physical properties by element type\n##Chemical properties by element type\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n##Citations\n##Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The playoffs began on January 14, 2023, and concluded with Super Bowl LVII on February 12, 2023.\n\n# Participants\n\nThe playoffs featured 14 teams, with seven teams from each conference qualifying for the tournament. The teams were seeded 1 through 7 in each conference, with the top seed in each conference receiving a first-round bye.\n\n## Unused format changes following Week 17 canceled Bills–Bengals game\n\nInitially, the NFL had planned to modify the playoff format if the Week 17 game between the Buffalo Bills and Cincinnati Bengals had not been played due to safety concerns following the on-field collapse of Bills player Damar Hamlin. Under the proposed changes, the winners of each division would have still received a top-four seed in their respective conferences. However, the seeding would have been determined by a series of tiebreakers involving win-loss record, strength of victory, and strength of schedule, rather than solely by win-loss record. Additionally, the fifth seed in each conference would have been awarded to the team with the best win-loss record among the remaining teams. The canceled game ultimately had no impact on the playoff format.\n\n## New postseason overtime rule\n\nBeginning with the 2022–23 playoffs, the NFL introduced a new overtime rule for postseason games. Under the previous rule, the game would have continued until a winner was determined, with both teams having the opportunity to possess the ball in overtime unless the first team scored a touchdown. The new rule allows both teams to possess the ball in overtime, unless the first team scores a touchdown. If the score is still tied after both teams have had the ball, the game continues until a winner is determined.\n\n# Bracket\n\nThe NFL playoff bracket featured the following matchups:\n\n* Wild Card Round: (5) Chargers at (4) Jaguars, (6) Dolphins at (3) Bills, (7) Seahawks at (2) 49ers, (6) Giants at (3) Vikings, (7) Buccaneers at (2) Cowboys, and (5) Ravens at (4) Bengals\n* Divisional Round: Winners of Chargers/Jaguars and Ravens/Bengals at (1) Chiefs and (2) Bills, and winners of Seahawks/49ers and Giants/Vikings at (1) Eagles and (2) Cowboys\n* Conference Championships: Winners of Divisional Round games\n* Super Bowl LVII: Winners of Conference Championships\n\n# Schedule\n\nThe playoff schedule was as follows:\n\n* Wild Card Round: January 14–16\n* Divisional Round: January 21–22\n* Conference Championships: January 29\n* Super Bowl LVII: February 12\n\n# Wild Card playoffs\n\n## Saturday, January 14, 2023\n\n### NFC: San Francisco 49ers 41, Seattle Seahawks 23\n\nThe 49ers dominated the Seahawks, with quarterback Brock Purdy throwing for 332 yards and three touchdowns.

Grusch's assertions, which he made public through various media channels and testimony before a Congressional committee, have sparked intense debate and scrutiny from experts, government officials, and the general public. This article provides an overview of Grusch's background, his public claims, and the responses from relevant experts, government agencies, and the media.\n\n#Background\n\nDavid Grusch, a former employee of the United States government, worked for the Department of Defense (DoD) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in various capacities. Grusch's employment with these agencies spanned several years, during which he reportedly gained access to classified information and participated in projects related to the study of UFOs and Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP). Grusch's exact role and level of clearance during his employment with the DoD and NASA are not publicly disclosed.\n\n#Grusch's public claims\n\nGrusch's public claims, which he began making in 2022, center on his alleged involvement in a secret government program tasked with investigating and studying UFOs and UAP. According to Grusch, this program, which he claims was established in the 1980s, aimed to gather intelligence on extraterrestrial life and technology. Grusch asserts that he witnessed and participated in various projects related to this program, including the examination of alleged alien spacecraft and the study of extraterrestrial biological entities.\n\nGrusch's claims also involve the alleged existence of a secret underground facility, which he claims was used to store and study extraterrestrial technology and biological samples. Grusch asserts that he interacted with extraterrestrial beings during his employment with the DoD and NASA and that these interactions involved the sharing of information and technology.\n\n#Response from relevant experts\n\nExperts in the fields of astrophysics, astrobiology, and ufology have responded to Grusch's claims with a mix of skepticism and curiosity. Some experts have questioned the validity of Grusch's claims, citing a lack of concrete evidence and the implausibility of some of his assertions. Others have expressed interest in Grusch's claims, suggesting that they may be worthy of further investigation and study.\n\n#United States government responses\n\n##Department of Defense and NASA statements\n\nThe Department of Defense and NASA have issued statements in response to Grusch's claims. In a statement, the DoD acknowledged that Grusch was a former employee but declined to comment on the specifics of his claims. NASA also acknowledged Grusch's employment with the agency but stated that it had no information to corroborate his claims.\n\n##Congressional action and comments from members\n\nIn 2023, the United States House Committee on Oversight and Accountability held a hearing on the topic of UFOs and UAP. Grusch testified before the committee, reiterating his claims and providing additional details. Members of the committee expressed a range of reactions to Grusch's testimony, with some expressing skepticism and others expressing interest in further investigation.\n\n##2023 House Committee Oversight and Accountability hearing\n\nDuring the hearing, Grusch testified for several hours, providing detailed information about his alleged involvement in the secret government program. Grusch also answered questions from committee members, addressing concerns about the validity of his claims and the potential implications of his testimony. The hearing was widely reported in the media, with many outlets focusing on the sensational aspects of Grusch's claims.\n\n#Sean Kirkpatrick\n\nSean Kirkpatrick, the director of the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), a Department of Defense agency established in 2022 to investigate UAP sightings, has publicly addressed Grusch's claims. Kirkpatrick expressed skepticism about Grusch's assertions, stating that there was no evidence to corroborate his claims. Kirkpatrick also emphasized the importance of relying on empirical evidence and scientific inquiry when investigating UAP sightings.\n\n#Media reporting on Grusch's claims\n\n##Connections to studies funded by Robert Bigelow\n\nSome media outlets have reported on connections between Grusch's claims and studies funded by Robert Bigelow, a billionaire entrepreneur and UFO enthusiast. Bigelow's company, Bigelow Aerospace, has funded various studies on UAP and extraterrestrial life, including a study on the alleged existence of extraterrestrial biological entities.\n\n##Reporting on psychiatric treatment received by Grusch\n\nSome media outlets have reported on Grusch's receipt of psychiatric treatment, suggesting that his claims may be the result of mental health issues. Grusch has denied these allegations, stating that his treatment was unrelated to his claims.\n\n##News stories and commentary\n\nGrusch's claims have been the subject of numerous news stories and commentary pieces. Many outlets have focused on the sensational aspects of Grusch's claims, while others have approached the topic with a more skeptical tone.\n\n##Disinformation campaign allegations from media pundits\n\nSome media pundits have alleged that Grusch's claims are part of a disinformation campaign aimed at deceiving the public about the existence of extraterrestrial life. These allegations have been denied by Grusch, who asserts that his claims are genuine.\n\n##Additional responses from media pundits\n\nOther media pundits have responded to Grusch's claims with a mix of skepticism and curiosity. Some have expressed interest in further investigation and study, while others have questioned the validity of Grusch's assertions.\n\n#See also\n\n* Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs)\n* Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP)\n* Extraterrestrial life\n* Astrobiology\n* Ufology\n* Department of Defense\n* National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)\n* Robert Bigelow\n* Bigelow Aerospace\n* All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO)\n\n#References\n\n*Note: This article does not include citations or references, as per the requirements.\n\n#External links\n\n*Note: This article does not include external links, as per the requirements.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"David_Grusch_UFO_whistleblower_claims\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Grusch's public claims\n#Response from relevant experts\n#United States government responses\n##Department of Defense and NASA statements\n##Congressional action and comments from members\n##2023 House Committee Oversight and Accountability hearing\n#Sean Kirkpatrick\n#Media reporting on Grusch's claims\n##Connections to studies funded by Robert Bigelow\n##Reporting on psychiatric treatment received by Grusch\n##News stories and commentary\n##Disinformation campaign allegations from media pundits\n##Additional responses from media pundits\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The storm was named by the UK Met Office and was also known as Storm Zeynep in Germany and Storm Nora in Scandinavia.\n\nMeteorology\n------------\n\nStorm Eunice developed as a low-pressure system over the North Atlantic Ocean on February 14, 2022. The storm rapidly intensified as it moved eastwards, driven by a strong jet stream and a contrast in temperatures between the warm air from the Gulf Stream and the cold air from the Arctic. By February 17, the storm had reached its peak intensity, with sustained winds of over 100 km/h (62 mph) and gusts of up to 150 km/h (93 mph).\n\nThe storm's track took it across the UK, Netherlands, Germany, and Poland, causing widespread damage and disruption. The storm's strong winds were caused by the tight pressure gradient between the low-pressure system and the high-pressure system to the east. The storm's strong winds were also enhanced by the shape of the coastline, with the winds being funneled through narrow straits and estuaries.\n\nImpact\n--------\n\nThe impact of Storm Eunice was felt across Western and Central Europe, with widespread damage and disruption reported.\n\n### Belgium\n\nIn Belgium, the storm caused widespread damage and disruption, with over 100,000 households left without power. The strong winds caused trees to fall, blocking roads and railways, and several buildings were damaged. The port city of Antwerp was particularly affected, with several ships damaged and a number of containers blown off the quayside.\n\n### Czech Republic\n\nIn the Czech Republic, the storm caused significant damage, particularly in the western part of the country. The strong winds caused trees to fall, blocking roads and railways, and several buildings were damaged. The city of Prague was particularly affected, with several historic buildings damaged and a number of trees uprooted.\n\n### Denmark\n\nIn Denmark, the storm caused widespread damage and disruption, particularly on the west coast. The strong winds caused trees to fall, blocking roads and railways, and several buildings were damaged.

It is based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name, created by writer Roy Thomas and artist Gil Kane. The film stars Jared Leto as the titular character, Michael Morbius, a scientist who becomes a vampire-like creature after experimenting with a radical treatment for his rare blood disorder.\n\n#Plot\n\nThe film follows Dr. Michael Morbius, a brilliant biochemist who suffers from a rare blood disorder. Desperate to find a cure, Morbius conducts an experiment that merges his DNA with that of a vampire bat. The treatment initially seems successful, but it soon becomes apparent that Morbius has developed a set of terrifying and uncontrollable abilities, including superhuman strength, speed, and agility, as well as a thirst for blood.\n\nAs Morbius struggles to come to terms with his new condition, he becomes a target for the authorities and a mysterious figure from his past. He must also confront the darkness within himself and the monster that he has become. Along the way, he meets a scientist, Dr. Martine Bancroft, who helps him understand his new powers and the true nature of his condition.\n\n#Cast\n\n* Jared Leto as Dr. Michael Morbius\n* Matt Smith as Milo\n* Adria Arjona as Dr. Martine Bancroft\n* Jared Harris as Dr. Emil Nikos\n* Al Madrigal as Agent Rodriguez\n* Tyrese Gibson as Agent Stroud\n\n#Production\n\n##Development\n\nThe development of Morbius began in 2017, when Sony Pictures announced plans to create a new universe of Marvel characters, separate from the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The project was initially intended to be a part of the Venom franchise, but it was later decided to make it a standalone film.\n\nIn November 2017, it was announced that Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless would write the script, with Jared Leto set to star as the titular character. Daniel Espinosa was hired to direct the film in 2019.\n\n##Pre-production\n\nPre-production began in 2019, with the cast and crew preparing for the film's shoot. The script was finalized, and the production team began scouting locations and building sets.\n\n##Filming\n\nFilming began in February 2019 and took place in the United Kingdom and the United States. The shoot was initially scheduled to last for 12 weeks, but it was extended due to the complexity of the film's visual effects.\n\n##Post-production\n\nPost-production began in the summer of 2019 and lasted for over a year. The film's visual effects were handled by a team of artists and technicians, who worked to bring the character of Morbius to life.\n\n#Music\n\nThe film's score was composed by Jon Ekstrand, who also worked on the music for the film's trailers. The soundtrack features a mix of electronic and orchestral elements, reflecting the film's dark and suspenseful tone.\n\n#Marketing\n\nThe marketing campaign for Morbius began in 2020, with the release of the film's first trailer. The trailer was well-received by fans, who were eager to see the film's take on the Marvel character.\n\nIn the months leading up to the film's release, Sony released a series of posters and promotional images, showcasing the film's characters and action sequences.\n\n#Release\n\n##Theatrical\n\nMorbius was released in theaters on April 1, 2022, after being delayed several times due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The film opened in over 4,000 theaters in the United States and Canada, and it grossed over $39 million on its opening weekend.\n\n##Home media\n\nMorbius was released on DVD and Blu-ray in June 2022, and it is also available to stream on various platforms, including Amazon Prime Video and Apple TV.\n\n#Reception\n\n##Box office\n\nMorbius grossed over $163 million worldwide, with over $73 million of that coming from the United States and Canada. The film's box office performance was considered disappointing, given its production budget of over $75 million.\n\n##Critical response\n\nMorbius received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the film's visuals and action sequences but criticized its storytelling and characters. The film holds a 44% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on over 200 reviews.\n\n##Internet memes\n\nDespite its mixed reception, Morbius became a meme on the internet, with fans poking fun at the film's awkward moments and Jared Leto's performance. The film's \"it's Morbin' time\" catchphrase became a particular target for memes and jokes.\n\n#Future\n\nIn 2022, it was announced that Morbius would be part of a new franchise, with a sequel and spin-offs in development. However, the future of the franchise is uncertain, given the film's disappointing box office performance.\n\n#Notes\n\nMorbius is the third film in Sony's Marvel universe, following Venom and Venom: Let There Be Carnage. The film's success or failure will likely have an impact on the future of the franchise and Sony's plans for its Marvel characters.\n\n#References\n\nThis article does not include any references or citations.\n\n#External links\n\n* Morbius at IMDb\n* Morbius at Rotten Tomatoes\n* Morbius at Metacritic", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Morbius_(film)\" following this outline:\n\n#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production\n##Development\n##Pre-production\n##Filming\n##Post-production\n#Music\n#Marketing\n#Release\n##Theatrical\n##Home media\n#Reception\n##Box office\n##Critical response\n##Internet memes\n#Future\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The riots were characterized by widespread vandalism, looting, and clashes between protesters and police, resulting in significant damage to property and cultural sites.\n\n# Background\n\n## Killing of Nahel Merzouk\n\nOn June 27, 2023, Nahel Merzouk was shot and killed by a police officer in Nanterre, a suburb of Paris. The incident sparked widespread outrage and protests, with many condemning the police use of force and alleging racism. The circumstances surrounding Merzouk's death are still disputed, but it is reported that he was stopped by police for a traffic violation and resisted arrest.\n\n## 2017 law concerning traffic stops\n\nIn 2017, France passed a law allowing police to stop and search drivers without justification, which critics argue has led to racial profiling and increased tensions between law enforcement and minority communities. The law has been widely criticized by human rights groups and has been linked to several high-profile cases of police brutality.\n\n## Civil unrest related to policing\n\nThe Nahel Merzouk riots are the latest in a series of civil disturbances related to policing in France. In 2005, widespread riots broke out in response to the deaths of two teenagers who were electrocuted while fleeing police. In 2016, protests erupted over the alleged rape of a young black man by police officers. These incidents have highlighted long-standing tensions between law enforcement and minority communities in France.\n\n## Police brutality in France\n\nPolice brutality is a persistent problem in France, with numerous cases of excessive force and abuse of power reported in recent years. In 2020, the French government was forced to apologize for the beating of a black music producer by police officers, which was captured on video. The incident sparked widespread outrage and protests, with many calling for greater police accountability.\n\n## Racial profiling and false reporting\n\nRacial profiling is a significant issue in France, with many minority communities reporting being disproportionately targeted by police. A 2020 report by the French National Consultative Commission on Human Rights found that people of African and Arab descent were more likely to be stopped and searched by police than white people. False reporting is also a problem, with some police officers accused of fabricating charges or exaggerating incidents to justify their actions.\n\n## Social problems\n\nThe Nahel Merzouk riots have highlighted deeper social problems in France, including poverty, unemployment, and social exclusion. Many of the rioters were from disadvantaged backgrounds and felt that they had been failed by the system. The riots have also raised questions about the effectiveness of France's social policies and the ability of the government to address the needs of its most vulnerable citizens.\n\n# Events\n\n## Metropolitan France\n\n### 27–28 June\n\nThe riots began on June 27, the day of Nahel Merzouk's funeral, with clashes between protesters and police in Nanterre. The violence quickly spread to other parts of Paris and the surrounding suburbs, with reports of vandalism, looting, and arson.\n\n### 29–30 June\n\nOn June 29, the riots intensified, with protesters targeting police stations, government buildings, and businesses. The police responded with tear gas and rubber bullets, but were unable to contain the violence.\n\n### 1–2 July\n\nOn July 1, the riots spread to other parts of France, including the cities of Lyon, Marseille, and Bordeaux. The violence continued to escalate, with reports of gunfire and Molotov cocktails.\n\n### 3–4 July\n\nOn July 3, the French government deployed the military to the streets to quell the violence. The move was widely criticized by human rights groups, who argued that it was an overreaction.\n\n### 8 July\n\nOn July 8, the riots began to subside, with many protesters exhausted and demoralized. The government announced a series of measures to address the underlying causes of the violence, including increased funding for social programs and greater police accountability.\n\n### 10 July\n\nOn July 10, the French parliament voted to establish a commission to investigate the causes of the riots and the government's response. The move was seen as a step towards greater transparency and accountability.\n\n## Overseas France\n\nThe riots also spread to France's overseas territories, including Guadeloupe and Martinique. The violence was less intense than in metropolitan France, but still resulted in significant damage and disruption.\n\n## International\n\nThe Nahel Merzouk riots drew international attention, with many countries expressing concern about the violence and the underlying social issues. The United Nations and the European Union issued statements calling for calm and restraint.\n\n# Damage to cultural sites\n\nThe riots resulted in significant damage to cultural sites, including museums, galleries, and historic buildings. The most notable incident was the destruction of a 19th-century church in Nanterre, which was set on fire by rioters.\n\n# Estimated cost of the riots\n\nThe estimated cost of the riots is still unknown, but it is expected to be in the billions of euros. The damage to property, cultural sites, and infrastructure is extensive, and will take years to repair.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## Public officials and media\n\nThe riots were widely condemned by public officials and the media, who described them as \"senseless\" and \"destructive.\" Many called for greater police accountability and more effective social policies to address the underlying causes of the violence.\n\n## Police violence\n\nThe riots also highlighted the issue of police violence, with many protesters alleging that they had been beaten or mistreated by police. The government was forced to apologize for the actions of some police officers, who were accused of using excessive force.\n\n## Police revolt\n\nIn response to the riots, some police officers staged a revolt, refusing to work and demanding greater support and resources. The move was widely criticized by the government and human rights groups, who argued that it was an overreaction.\n\n## Misinformation\n\nThe riots were also marked by misinformation and disinformation, with many false reports and rumors circulating on social media. The government and fact-checking organizations struggled to keep up with the spread of misinformation, which contributed to the escalation of the violence.\n\n# See also\n\n* 2005 French riots\n* 2016 French protests\n* Police brutality in France\n* Racial profiling in France\n* Social inequality in France", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Nahel_Merzouk_riots\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Killing of Nahel Merzouk\n##2017 law concerning traffic stops\n##Civil unrest related to policing\n##Police brutality in France\n##Racial profiling and false reporting\n##Social problems\n#Events\n##Metropolitan France\n###27–28 June\n###29–30 June\n###1–2 July\n###3–4 July\n###8 July\n###10 July\n##Overseas France\n##International\n#Damage to cultural sites\n#Estimated cost of the riots\n#Reactions\n##Public officials and media\n##Police violence\n##Police revolt\n##Misinformation\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The earthquakes were centered in the Pazarcık district of Kahramanmaraş Province in Turkey, and the Aleppo Governorate in Syria. The disaster was one of the deadliest natural disasters of the 21st century, with thousands of people killed and many more injured or left homeless.\n\n# Tectonic setting\n\n## Geology\n\nThe region where the earthquakes occurred is located in the Eastern Anatolian Fault Zone, a complex area of tectonic activity that extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the Persian Gulf. The zone is characterized by a combination of strike-slip and normal faulting, resulting from the northward motion of the Arabian Plate relative to the Eurasian Plate. The Eastern Anatolian Fault Zone is responsible for many significant earthquakes in the region, including the 1939 Erzincan earthquake and the 1999 İzmit earthquake.\n\n## Seismicity\n\nThe region has a high level of seismic activity, with many earthquakes occurring each year. However, the majority of these earthquakes are small, with magnitudes less than 3.0. Larger earthquakes, such as those that occurred in 2023, are less common but can have devastating consequences.\n\n# Earthquake sequence\n\n## Aftershocks\n\nFollowing the initial earthquakes, a series of aftershocks occurred in the region, with many exceeding magnitude 5.0. Aftershocks continued to occur for several weeks after the initial earthquakes, causing further damage and disrupting rescue efforts.\n\n## Seismology\n\nThe earthquakes were caused by a combination of strike-slip and normal faulting, resulting from the northward motion of the Arabian Plate relative to the Eurasian Plate. The earthquakes were shallow, with focal depths of approximately 10-20 km.\n\n## Rupture propagation\n\nThe rupture propagated northwestward from the epicenter, with a total length of approximately 100 km. The rupture velocity was estimated to be around 2.5-3.0 km/s.\n\n## Surface rupture\n\nThe earthquakes caused significant surface rupture, with a maximum offset of approximately 4-5 meters. The surface rupture was observed along the Eastern Anatolian Fault Zone, with a total length of approximately 100 km.\n\n## Ground motion\n\nThe earthquakes caused significant ground motion, with peak ground accelerations exceeding 1.0 g in some areas. The ground motion was intense, with many buildings and structures collapsing or suffering significant damage.\n\n## Geological effects\n\nThe earthquakes caused significant geological effects, including landslides, rockfalls, and liquefaction. The earthquakes also triggered a tsunami in the Mediterranean Sea, with waves reaching as high as 1-2 meters.\n\n## Tsunami\n\nThe tsunami was triggered by the earthquakes and affected several countries in the Mediterranean region. The tsunami caused significant damage and loss of life, particularly in coastal areas.\n\n## Effects on other faults\n\nThe earthquakes may have affected other faults in the region, potentially triggering future earthquakes. The Eastern Anatolian Fault Zone is a complex area of tectonic activity, and the earthquakes may have altered the stress on other faults in the region.\n\n# Damage and casualties\n\n## In Turkey\n\nThe earthquakes caused widespread destruction in Turkey, with many buildings and structures collapsing or suffering significant damage. The city of Kahramanmaraş was particularly affected, with thousands of buildings destroyed or damaged. The earthquakes also caused significant damage to infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and utilities.\n\n## In Syria\n\nThe earthquakes also caused significant damage in Syria, particularly in the Aleppo Governorate. The city of Aleppo was severely affected, with many buildings and structures collapsing or suffering significant damage. The earthquakes also caused significant damage to infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and utilities.\n\n## Foreign casualties\n\nThe earthquakes also caused casualties among foreign nationals, including tourists and aid workers. Several countries reported casualties among their citizens, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany.\n\n## Effects in other countries\n\nThe earthquakes also had effects in other countries, including Lebanon, Jordan, and Israel. The earthquakes caused significant damage and disruption in these countries, particularly in areas with large Syrian refugee populations.\n\n## Aftershocks\n\nThe aftershocks caused further damage and disruption in the affected areas, particularly in Turkey and Syria. The aftershocks continued to occur for several weeks after the initial earthquakes, causing further damage and disrupting rescue efforts.\n\n## Estimations of losses\n\nThe estimations of losses from the earthquakes are significant, with many billions of dollars in damage and thousands of lives lost. The exact extent of the losses is difficult to determine, but it is clear that the earthquakes had a devastating impact on the region.\n\n# Aftermath\n\n## Turkey\n\n### Search and rescue\n\nThe search and rescue efforts in Turkey were led by the Turkish government, with assistance from international teams. The efforts were hampered by the scale of the disaster and the difficulty of accessing affected areas.\n\n### Charity and volunteer campaigns\n\nMany charity and volunteer campaigns were established to support the affected areas, with millions of dollars raised for relief efforts.\n\n### Government assistance\n\nThe Turkish government provided significant assistance to affected areas, including financial support, food, and shelter.\n\n### Incidents\n\nThere were several incidents during the aftermath, including looting and violence.

The incident occurred while Locke was sleeping on a couch in an apartment in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The shooting sparked widespread outrage and protests in the city, with many calling for greater accountability and reform within the Minneapolis Police Department.\n\nBackground\n\n### Persons involved\n\nAmir Locke was a 22-year-old African American man who was a student at Hennepin Technical College. He was also a musician and a family man. Locke was not the subject of the search warrant that led to his death, but rather a bystander who was in the apartment where the warrant was being executed.\n\nThe officers involved in the shooting were part of the Minneapolis Police Department's SWAT team. The officer who fired the fatal shot was identified as Mark Hanneman, a 13-year veteran of the department.\n\n### Search warrant\n\nThe search warrant that led to Locke's death was obtained by the Minneapolis Police Department as part of a homicide investigation. The warrant was for an apartment in the Bolero Flats complex in downtown Minneapolis, where Locke was staying with friends.\n\nThe warrant was a \"no-knock\" warrant, which allows police to enter a premises without announcing their presence. The use of no-knock warrants has been the subject of controversy in recent years, with many arguing that they increase the risk of violence and civilian casualties.\n\nIncident\n\nOn the morning of February 2, 2022, the Minneapolis Police Department's SWAT team executed the search warrant at the Bolero Flats apartment complex. Locke was sleeping on a couch in the apartment when the officers entered. According to body camera footage, Locke was startled and reached for a gun that was under the couch cushion. Officer Hanneman shot Locke three times, striking him in the chest and hip.\n\nLocke was pronounced dead at the scene. The officers on the scene immediately rendered aid, but Locke's injuries were fatal.\n\nInvestigations\n\nThe Minneapolis Police Department launched an internal investigation into the shooting, which was led by the department's Office of Police Conduct Review. The Minnesota Bureau of Investigation (BCA) also launched a separate investigation into the shooting.\n\nThe BCA's investigation found that Locke was not the target of the search warrant and that he did not have any known connection to the homicide investigation. The investigation also found that Locke had a permit to carry a firearm, but that he did not have a history of violent behavior.\n\nNo-knock warrant moratorium and restrictions\n\nIn the aftermath of Locke's death, the city of Minneapolis implemented a moratorium on the use of no-knock warrants. The moratorium was later made permanent by the Minneapolis City Council, which voted to ban the use of no-knock warrants in the city.\n\nThe state of Minnesota also took action to restrict the use of no-knock warrants. In May 2022, Governor Tim Walz signed a bill into law that limits the use of no-knock warrants in the state. The law requires police to announce their presence before entering a premises, unless there is a clear danger to the officers or others.\n\nReaction\n\n### Family\n\nLocke's family was devastated by his death. His mother, Karen Locke, described him as a \"beautiful soul\" who was loved by everyone who knew him. Locke's family called for greater accountability and reform within the Minneapolis Police Department, and for an end to the use of no-knock warrants.\n\n### Officials\n\nMinneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Police Chief Medaria Arradondo both condemned the shooting and promised to take action to prevent similar incidents in the future. Governor Tim Walz also expressed his condolences to Locke's family and called for greater accountability within the Minneapolis Police Department.\n\n### Community groups\n\nCommunity groups in Minneapolis were outraged by Locke's death and called for greater action to address police violence and racism in the city. The Minneapolis chapter of the NAACP called for the Minneapolis Police Department to be disbanded and reconstituted with a focus on community policing.\n\nProtests\n\n### In Minneapolis—Saint Paul\n\nProtests erupted in Minneapolis and Saint Paul in the aftermath of Locke's death. Thousands of people took to the streets to demand justice and call for an end to police violence. The protests were largely peaceful, but there were some reports of property damage and clashes between protesters and police.\n\n### Elsewhere\n\nProtests also took place in other cities across the United States, including New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago. The protests were part of a larger movement to address police violence and racism in the United States.\n\nCivil lawsuit\n\nIn August 2022, Locke's family filed a civil lawsuit against the city of Minneapolis and the Minneapolis Police Department. The lawsuit alleges that the police department's use of no-knock warrants and its failure to properly train officers contributed to Locke's death.\n\nSee also\n\n* List of killings by law enforcement officers in the United States\n* Police brutality in the United States\n* Racism in the United States\n\nReferences\n\n(To be added)\n\nExternal links\n\n(To be added)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Killing_of_Amir_Locke\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Persons involved\n##Search warrant\n#Incident\n#Investigations\n#No-knock warrant moratorium and restrictions\n#Reaction\n##Family\n##Officials\n##Community groups\n#Protests\n##In Minneapolis—Saint Paul\n##Elsewhere\n#Civil lawsuit\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The film is a sequel to the 2018 film The Meg, and stars Jason Statham, Wu Jing, and Sophia Cai.\n\n#Plot\n\nThe plot of Meg: The Trench follows the story of Jonas Taylor, a deep-sea rescue diver, as he faces a new threat in the depths of the ocean. The film takes place after the events of the first movie, where Taylor had defeated the massive prehistoric shark, the Megalodon. However, a new and even more terrifying creature emerges from the depths, threatening the world's oceans and the people who inhabit them.\n\nAs Taylor delves deeper into the mystery of the new creature, he must confront his own personal demons and team up with a group of scientists and explorers to stop the beast before it's too late. Along the way, he discovers a hidden underwater trench, teeming with life and filled with secrets that could change the course of human history.\n\n#Cast\n\nThe film features an ensemble cast, including:\n\n* Jason Statham as Jonas Taylor, a deep-sea rescue diver\n* Wu Jing as Suyin Zhang, a Chinese oceanographer and Taylor's love interest\n* Sophia Cai as Meiying, Suyin's daughter\n* Cliff Curtis as James \"Mac\" Mackreides, a marine biologist\n* Page Kennedy as DJ, a marine engineer\n* Ruby Rose as Jaxx Herd, a marine biologist\n* Rainn Wilson as Jack Morris, a billionaire investor\n\n#Production\n\n##Development\n\nThe development of Meg: The Trench began shortly after the release of the first film, which was a commercial success and received mixed reviews from critics. The studio, Gravity Pictures, was keen to capitalize on the success of the first film and greenlit a sequel.\n\nDean Georgaris, Jon Hoeber, and Erich Hoeber were brought on board to write the script, which was developed in conjunction with the director, Ben Wheatley. Wheatley, known for his work on films like High-Rise and Free Fire, was attracted to the project due to its unique blend of science fiction and action elements.\n\n##Pre-production\n\nPre-production on Meg: The Trench began in early 2022, with the cast and crew assembling in various locations around the world. The film's budget was estimated to be around $150 million, with a significant portion of that going towards visual effects and location shooting.\n\nThe film's production team, led by producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura, worked closely with the cast and crew to develop the story and characters. The film's script was rewritten several times during pre-production, with the team making changes to the story and characters based on feedback from the cast and crew.\n\n##Filming\n\nPrincipal photography on Meg: The Trench began in June 2022, with the cast and crew filming on location in China, the United States, and other locations around the world. The film's cinematographer, Haris Zambarloukos, used a combination of practical and visual effects to bring the film's underwater world to life.\n\nThe film's action sequences were choreographed by stunt coordinator, Vic Armstrong, who worked closely with the cast and crew to develop the film's complex action set pieces. The film's visual effects were handled by the team at Weta Digital, who worked closely with the production team to develop the film's creatures and environments.\n\n##Post-production\n\nPost-production on Meg: The Trench began in late 2022, with the film's editor, Jonathan Amos, working closely with the director and production team to develop the film's final cut. The film's visual effects were refined during post-production, with the team at Weta Digital working to perfect the film's creatures and environments.\n\nThe film's sound design was handled by the team at Skywalker Sound, who worked closely with the production team to develop the film's complex sound effects and mix. The film's music was composed by Marco Beltrami, who worked closely with the director and production team to develop the film's score.\n\n##Music\n\nThe film's score was composed by Marco Beltrami, who worked closely with the director and production team to develop the film's music. The score was recorded at the Abbey Road Studios in London, with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra performing the film's themes.\n\nThe film's soundtrack features a combination of electronic and orchestral elements, with the score incorporating themes from the first film.

The ceremony honored the best films, actors, directors, and other professionals of the film industry for their outstanding work in 2021.

Other notable winners included Will Smith, who won his first Oscar for Best Actor for his portrayal of Richard Williams in \"King Richard,\" and Jessica Chastain, who won the Best Actress award for her role as Tammy Faye Bakker in \"The Eyes of Tammy Faye.\"\n\n## Governors Awards\n\n### Honorary Academy Awards\n\nThe Academy presented Honorary Oscars to three deserving individuals for their significant contributions to the film industry.

The incident sparked a heated debate on social media, with some defending Smith's actions and others condemning his behavior.
