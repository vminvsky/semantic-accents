However, due to the remote location and the fact that the attacks were occurring simultaneously at multiple locations, it took some time for additional officers to arrive.

The accident released toxic chemicals into the air and water, prompting a massive emergency response and raising concerns about public health and safety. This article provides an overview of the events surrounding the derailment, the response efforts, and the ongoing investigations into the cause of the disaster.\n\n#Background\n\nThe Norfolk Southern Railway train, consisting of 151 cars, was traveling from Madison, Illinois, to Conway, Pennsylvania, when it derailed in East Palestine, a small village in Columbiana County, Ohio. The train was carrying a variety of hazardous materials, including vinyl chloride, ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, and ethylhexyl acrylate. The derailment occurred at approximately 8:55 pm local time, and the subsequent fire burned for several days.\n\n#Derailment\n\nThe train derailment was reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA). Initial reports suggested that the derailment was caused by a mechanical issue with one of the train's axles. However, the exact cause of the derailment remains under investigation.\n\n#Emergency Response and Burn Off\n\nFollowing the derailment, local authorities and emergency responders were quickly deployed to the scene. The initial response focused on containing the fire and preventing the spread of hazardous materials. Due to concerns about the potential for a catastrophic explosion, officials decided to conduct a controlled burn of the vinyl chloride, a highly flammable and toxic chemical.\n\n##Burnoff Unnecessary\n\nHowever, some experts have questioned the decision to conduct the burnoff, citing concerns about the potential health and environmental impacts. Critics argue that the burnoff was unnecessary and that alternative methods, such as allowing the vinyl chloride to slowly vent, could have been used to mitigate the risks.\n\n#Health and Environmental Concerns\n\nThe derailment and subsequent burnoff have raised significant concerns about public health and environmental safety. Residents in the surrounding area have reported a range of symptoms, including headaches, nausea, and respiratory issues. Environmental groups have also expressed concerns about the potential long-term impacts on local ecosystems.\n\n##Waste Disposal\n\nThe disposal of hazardous waste from the derailment has also become a major concern. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has been working with local authorities to ensure that the waste is disposed of safely and in accordance with federal regulations.\n\n##Independent Testing\n\nIn response to concerns about the accuracy of official testing, several independent organizations have conducted their own tests for hazardous chemicals in the air and water. These tests have revealed high levels of contamination in some areas, further fueling concerns about public health and safety.\n\n##Whistleblower and Cover-Up Allegations\n\nA whistleblower has come forward alleging that Norfolk Southern Railway officials knew about the mechanical issue with the train's axle before the derailment but failed to take action. The whistleblower also claims that the company has been engaged in a cover-up, downplaying the severity of the accident and the risks to public health.\n\n#Aftermath\n\nThe derailment has had a significant impact on the local community, with many residents forced to evacuate their homes and businesses. The accident has also raised concerns about the safety of the rail network and the need for greater regulation of the industry.\n\n##Lawsuits and Compensation\n\nSeveral lawsuits have been filed against Norfolk Southern Railway, seeking compensation for damages and injuries sustained as a result of the derailment. The company has established a claims process for affected residents and businesses.\n\n##NTSB Board Meeting and Findings\n\nThe NTSB has held a board meeting to discuss the preliminary findings of its investigation into the derailment. The board has identified several key factors contributing to the accident, including the mechanical issue with the train's axle and inadequate safety procedures.\n\n##Federal Railroad Administration Safety Culture Assessment\n\nThe FRA has announced plans to conduct a safety culture assessment of Norfolk Southern Railway, focusing on the company's safety practices and procedures.\n\n#Inquiry and Cause\n\nThe investigation into the cause of the derailment is ongoing, with several agencies involved, including the NTSB, FRA, and EPA.\n\n##Hearings\n\nCongressional hearings have been held to examine the causes of the derailment and the response efforts. The hearings have raised concerns about the need for greater regulation of the rail industry and the importance of prioritizing public safety.\n\n##Brakes\n\nThe investigation has revealed that the train's brakes were not functioning properly at the time of the derailment. The NTSB has identified this as a critical factor contributing to the accident.\n\n#Reactions\n\nThe derailment has sparked a range of reactions, from local residents and community leaders to national politicians and environmental groups.\n\n##Congress\n\nMembers of Congress have called for greater regulation of the rail industry and increased funding for safety measures. Several bills have been introduced aimed at improving rail safety and preventing similar accidents in the future.\n\n##Misinformation\n\nThere have been reports of misinformation and disinformation circulating about the derailment, including false claims about the severity of the accident and the risks to public health.\n\n##Comparisons\n\nThe derailment has been compared to other high-profile environmental disasters, including the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill and the 1984 Bhopal disaster.\n\n#Subsequent Derailments\n\nThere have been several subsequent derailments involving hazardous materials, raising concerns about the safety of the rail network and the need for greater regulation.\n\n#See Also\n\n* List of rail accidents in the United States\n* Environmental disasters in the United States\n* Rail safety in the United States\n\n#Further Reading\n\n* National Transportation Safety Board.

It was designed and manufactured by the Integral Coach Factory (ICF) in Chennai, India, and is considered a symbol of Indian engineering and manufacturing capabilities. The train service was launched in 2019 and has been a significant upgrade to the country's rail network.\n\n# History\n\nThe history of the Vande Bharat Express dates back to the 1960s, when Indian Railways first began exploring ways to increase the speed of its trains.\n\n## Efforts to increase speed (1960–2016)\n\nIn the 1960s, Indian Railways introduced the Rajdhani Express, a high-speed train service that connected the national capital, New Delhi, to major cities across the country. However, the speed of these trains was limited to around 100 km/h (62 mph) due to the existing infrastructure and rolling stock. Over the years, Indian Railways continued to upgrade its infrastructure and introduce new trains, but the speeds remained relatively low compared to international standards.\n\nIn the 2000s, Indian Railways began exploring the possibility of introducing high-speed trains, with speeds of over 200 km/h (124 mph). However, these plans were delayed due to various reasons, including funding constraints and technical challenges.\n\n## Making an indigenous trainset (2016–19)\n\nIn 2016, the Indian government announced plans to manufacture a high-speed train set indigenously, with the goal of reducing dependence on foreign technology. The Integral Coach Factory (ICF) in Chennai was tasked with designing and manufacturing the train set.\n\nThe ICF worked closely with Indian Railways and other stakeholders to design a train set that would meet the requirements of high-speed travel. The train set was designed to have a maximum speed of 180 km/h (112 mph), with advanced features such as automatic doors, air conditioning, and comfortable seating.\n\n## Introduction and further (2019–present)\n\nThe Vande Bharat Express was launched on February 15, 2019, with the inaugural run from New Delhi to Varanasi. The train was flagged off by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who hailed it as a symbol of Indian engineering and manufacturing capabilities.\n\nSince its launch, the Vande Bharat Express has been a huge success, with high occupancy rates and positive feedback from passengers. Indian Railways has announced plans to introduce more Vande Bharat Express trains on various routes across the country, with the goal of upgrading the rail network and providing faster and more comfortable travel options to passengers.\n\n# Rolling stock\n\nThe Vande Bharat Express has a unique and advanced rolling stock, designed and manufactured by the ICF. The train set consists of 16 coaches, including two driving trailers, 12 passenger coaches, and two power cars.\n\nThe train set is powered by two electric traction motors, each with a capacity of 2,800 kW.

The period was marked by increased tensions between Russia and Ukraine, as well as between Russia and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), as a result of a series of military buildups, diplomatic incidents, and allegations of subversion and aggression.\n\n#Background\n\nThe roots of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine date back to the annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014, following the Ukrainian Revolution. The annexation was widely condemned by the international community, and it led to the outbreak of the War in Donbas, a conflict between Ukrainian government forces and Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. The conflict had resulted in the deaths of over 14,000 people and the displacement of millions by the time of the Russian invasion.\n\n#Initial tensions (March–April 2021)\n\n##First Russian military buildup\n\nIn March 2021, Russia began a large-scale military buildup along its border with Ukraine, involving the deployment of thousands of troops, tanks, and artillery pieces. The buildup was widely seen as a sign of increased tensions between Russia and Ukraine, and it led to concerns about the potential for a new conflict.\n\n##Continued violence and escalation\n\nThe military buildup was accompanied by an increase in violence along the line of contact between Ukrainian government forces and Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. The violence resulted in the deaths of several Ukrainian soldiers and civilians, and it led to calls for increased international support for Ukraine.\n\n##Partial withdrawal\n\nIn April 2021, Russia announced that it would be withdrawing some of its troops from the border with Ukraine, citing the completion of military exercises. However, many of the troops remained in place, and the withdrawal was seen as a partial and insufficient response to international concerns.\n\n#Renewed tensions (October 2021–February 2022)\n\n##Second Russian military buildup\n\nIn October 2021, Russia began a new military buildup along its border with Ukraine, involving the deployment of tens of thousands of troops, tanks, and artillery pieces. The buildup was seen as a significant escalation of the conflict, and it led to increased international concerns about the potential for a new invasion.\n\n###November 2021–December 2021\n\nIn November and December 2021, the buildup continued, with reports of Russian troops and military equipment being deployed to the border region. The United States and other Western countries expressed concerns about the buildup, and they called on Russia to withdraw its troops.\n\n###January 2022\n\nIn January 2022, the buildup continued, with reports of Russian troops and military equipment being deployed to the border region. The United States and other Western countries imposed economic sanctions on Russia in response to the buildup.\n\n###February 2022\n\nIn February 2022, the buildup reached its peak, with reports of over 150,000 Russian troops deployed to the border region. The United States and other Western countries warned of an imminent invasion, and they called on Russia to withdraw its troops.\n\n##Alleged Russian subversion attempts\n\nIn January 2022, Ukraine accused Russia of attempting to subvert its government through a series of cyberattacks and other forms of subversion. The United States and other Western countries expressed concerns about the allegations, and they called on Russia to cease its activities.\n\n###2022 Ukrainian coup d'état attempt\n\nIn February 2022, Ukraine accused Russia of attempting to stage a coup d'état in the country, citing reports of Russian-backed operatives attempting to infiltrate the", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Prelude_to_the_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Initial tensions (March–April 2021)\n##First Russian military buildup\n##Continued violence and escalation\n##Partial withdrawal\n#Renewed tensions (October 2021–February 2022)\n##Second Russian military buildup\n###November 2021–December 2021\n###January 2022\n###February 2022\n##Alleged Russian subversion attempts\n###2022 Ukrainian coup d'état attempt\n##Russian accusations of genocide in eastern Ukraine\n##Ukrainian defences\n###Foreign support\n##Reinforcements deployed in NATO\n#Escalation and invasion (February 2022 – present)\n##Alleged clashes between Russia and Ukraine\n##Recognition of the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics\n###Putin's denial of Ukrainian statehood\n###International sanctions on Russia\n##Invasion\n#Diplomatic negotiations\n##NATO–Russia security talks\n##United Nations Security Council\n##International treaties and negotiation structures\n##Lavrov–EU correspondence\n#See also\n#Explanatory notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Despite the challenges, the protests remained an important symbol of opposition to the war.\n\n## September\n\nIn September, protests flared up again, with demonstrations taking place in cities across Russia. The protests were sparked by the mobilization of Russian reservists, which many saw as a desperate attempt by the government to turn the tide of the war.\n\n# Other direct action\n\nIn addition to street protests, many Russians have engaged in other forms of direct action to express their opposition to the war.\n\n## Russian military personnel\n\nSome Russian military personnel have refused to serve in Ukraine, citing their opposition to the war.

These laws have been used to silence critics and stifle dissent.\n\n## Reprisals\n\nMany protesters have been arrested, beaten, and imprisoned for their participation in anti-war activities. The Russian government has also used economic reprisals, including the freezing of bank accounts and the seizure of assets.\n\n## Mass arrests\n\nThe Russian police have carried out mass arrests of protesters, often using brutal force to disperse crowds. These arrests have been widely condemned by human rights groups and have helped to galvanize public opinion against the war.\n\n## Police brutality\n\nThere have been numerous reports of police brutality, including beatings, torture, and intimidation.

Many Russians have also expressed opposition to the anti-war movement, often citing patriotic and nationalist sentiments.\n\n## Exodus of Russians\n\nThe war has sparked an exodus of Russians, with many fleeing the country to avoid military service or persecution. This exodus has placed a significant strain on neighboring countries and has helped to galvanize international opposition to the war.\n\n## Opinion polls\n\nOpinion polls have shown that a significant minority of Russians oppose the war and are critical of the government's actions.

Despite this, the opposition has played an important role in galvanizing public opinion against the war.\n\n## Risks of protesting\n\nProtesting in Russia is a high-risk activity, which can result in arrest, injury, and persecution. Despite these risks, many Russians have been willing to take to the streets to express their opposition to the war.\n\n## Demographics\n\nThe anti-war movement in Russia is a diverse movement, which has attracted people from all walks of life. Despite this, the movement has been dominated by young people and urban dwellers, who are more likely to be critical of the government.\n\n## Impact of state media and censorship\n\nThe Russian government's control of the media and its use of censorship have had a significant impact on public opinion. Despite this, many Russians have been able to access alternative sources of information, which have helped to galvanize opposition to the war.\n\n## Impact of international sanctions\n\nThe international community has imposed significant sanctions on Russia, which have had a major impact on the country's economy.

The club was founded in 1926 and has since become one of the most successful and popular football clubs in Greece. PAOK has a rich history, having won numerous domestic and international titles, and has a strong following of supporters.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### Foundation and early years (1926–1939)\n\nPAOK was founded on April 20, 1926, by a group of Greek refugees from Constantinople, who had fled to Thessaloniki after the Greco-Turkish War. The club's name is an acronym for \"Panthessalonikeios Athlitikos Omilos Konstantinoupoliton,\" which translates to \"Pan-Thessalonian Athletic Club of Constantinopolitans.\" The club's early years were marked by struggles, both on and off the pitch, as it competed in local and regional competitions.\n\n### Greco-Italian War and World War II (1939–1945)\n\nDuring World War II, PAOK's activities were suspended due to the war.

The budget aimed to stimulate economic growth and address the cost of living crisis in the UK. However, it sparked widespread criticism and led to significant market volatility, ultimately contributing to the resignation of Prime Minister Liz Truss.\n\n# Background\n\nThe mini-budget was announced by the newly formed government of Prime Minister Liz Truss, who had taken office on 6 September 2022. Truss had campaigned on a platform of tax cuts and deregulation, and the budget was seen as an attempt to implement these policies. The UK economy was facing significant challenges, including high inflation, a cost of living crisis, and the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n# The budget\n\nThe mini-budget was a fiscal event that did not involve a full parliamentary budget, but rather a statement by the Chancellor outlining the government's tax and spending plans. The budget included a range of measures aimed at stimulating economic growth and reducing the tax burden on individuals and businesses.\n\n## Key points\n\nThe key points of the mini-budget included:\n\n* A reduction in the basic rate of income tax from 20% to 19%\n* The abolition of the 45% top rate of income tax\n* An increase in the National Insurance threshold\n* A reduction in stamp duty on house purchases\n* A freeze on corporation tax\n* A range of measures to support businesses, including the creation of low-tax \"investment zones\"\n\n# Reaction\n\nThe mini-budget was met with widespread criticism and concern from economists, politicians, and the media. Many argued that the budget would exacerbate inequality and increase the national debt.\n\n## Currency, interest rate, and debt\n\nThe pound sterling fell to a record low against the US dollar in the aftermath of the budget, while interest rates on UK government bonds rose sharply. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) estimated that the budget would increase the national debt by £400 billion over the next five years.\n\n## Bond markets\n\nThe budget led to significant volatility in the bond markets, with the yield on 10-year UK government bonds rising by over 1% in the days following the budget. This increase in yields made it more expensive for the government to borrow money and led to concerns about the sustainability of the national debt.\n\n## International response\n\nThe international community also expressed concern about the budget. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) issued a statement saying that the budget would \"likely increase inequality\" and that the UK government should consider a more balanced approach to fiscal policy.\n\n## Business and economic\n\nMany businesses and economists expressed concern about the budget, arguing that it would increase inequality and reduce economic growth. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said that the budget was a \"missed opportunity\" to address the UK's productivity crisis.\n\n## Media\n\nThe media reaction to the budget was largely negative. Many newspapers and commentators criticized the budget for being unfair and for increasing the national debt.\n\n## Political\n\nThe opposition Labour Party criticized the budget for being a \"tax cut for the rich\" and for increasing inequality. The Liberal Democrats also criticized the budget, saying that it would \"make the rich richer and the poor poorer\".\n\n## Opinion polling\n\nOpinion polling in the aftermath of the budget showed that the public was largely opposed to the measures announced by the Chancellor. A YouGov poll found that 71% of voters thought that the budget was \"unfair\", while a Survation poll found that 64% of voters opposed the abolition of the 45% top rate of income tax.\n\n# Government response\n\n## Initial responses\n\nThe government initially defended the budget, with the Chancellor saying that it was necessary to stimulate economic growth. However, as the criticism mounted, the government began to backpedal on some of the measures.\n\n## Dismissal of Chancellor\n\nOn 14 October 2022, Prime Minister Liz Truss announced that Kwasi Kwarteng had been dismissed as Chancellor. He was replaced by Jeremy Hunt, who immediately announced that he would be reversing many of the tax cuts announced in the mini-budget.\n\n## Reversal of tax cuts\n\nOn 17 October 2022, Jeremy Hunt announced that he would be reversing many of the tax cuts announced in the mini-budget. This included the abolition of the 45% top rate of income tax and the reduction in the basic rate of income tax.\n\n# Resignation of Truss as Prime Minister\n\nOn 25 October 2022, Liz Truss announced that she would be resigning as Prime Minister. She had been in office for just 45 days, making her the shortest-serving Prime Minister in UK history.\n\n# Subsequent events\n\n## Following Truss's resignation\n\nFollowing Truss's resignation, a leadership election was held to select a new Conservative Party leader. Rishi Sunak was elected as the new leader and became Prime Minister.\n\n## Later events\n\nThe UK economy continued to face significant challenges in the months following the mini-budget. Inflation remained high, and the cost of living crisis continued to affect many households. The government announced a range of measures to support households, including a cap on energy prices and increased funding for public services.\n\n# See also\n\n* 2022 United Kingdom government crisis\n* Premiership of Liz Truss\n* Economic history of the United Kingdom\n* COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"September_2022_United_Kingdom_mini-budget\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#The budget\n##Key points\n#Reaction\n##Currency, interest rate, and debt\n##Bond markets\n##International response\n##Business and economic\n##Media\n##Political\n##Opinion polling\n#Government response\n##Initial responses\n##Dismissal of Chancellor\n##Reversal of tax cuts\n#Resignation of Truss as Prime Minister\n#Subsequent events\n##Following Truss's resignation\n##Later events\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The airstrikes targeted several villages in the provinces of Khost and Kunar, resulting in significant civilian casualties and damage to infrastructure. The incident marked a significant escalation in tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan, with both countries accusing each other of aggression and human rights abuses.\n\n# Background\n\nThe airstrikes were reportedly carried out by the PAF in response to a surge in cross-border attacks by the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a militant group that has been waging a violent insurgency against the Pakistani government since 2007. The TTP has allegedly been using Afghan soil to launch attacks against Pakistani security forces, leading to increased tensions between the two countries. Pakistan has long accused Afghanistan of providing safe haven to TTP militants, a claim that the Afghan government has repeatedly denied.\n\nIn the months leading up to the airstrikes, there had been a significant increase in violence along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, with both sides accusing each other of aggression. The situation was further complicated by the Taliban's return to power in Afghanistan in August 2021, which led to a deterioration in relations between the two countries.\n\n# Casualties\n\nThe airstrikes resulted in significant civilian casualties, with reports suggesting that at least 47 people were killed and over 20 injured. The majority of the victims were women and children, who were caught in the crossfire as the PAF targeted suspected TTP hideouts in the area. The strikes also damaged several homes and buildings, leaving many families without shelter.\n\nThe Afghan government was quick to condemn the airstrikes, with officials describing them as a \"clear violation of Afghanistan's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\" The Taliban's defense ministry also issued a statement, accusing Pakistan of \"aggression\" and vowing to take \"all necessary measures\" to protect Afghan civilians.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## Afghan government\n\nThe Afghan government strongly condemned the airstrikes, with officials describing them as a \"clear violation of Afghanistan's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\" The Taliban's defense ministry also issued a statement, accusing Pakistan of \"aggression\" and vowing to take \"all necessary measures\" to protect Afghan civilians.\n\nIn a statement, the Afghan foreign ministry called on the international community to condemn the airstrikes and to take action to prevent future incidents. The ministry also urged Pakistan to respect Afghanistan's sovereignty and to engage in dialogue to resolve outstanding issues.\n\n## Pakistani government\n\nThe Pakistani government defended the airstrikes, descri", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Pakistani_airstrikes_in_Afghanistan\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Casualties\n#Reactions\n##Afghan government\n##Pakistani government\n##Pakistani Taliban\n##United States government\n##Chinese government\n##United Nations\n#Protests\n#Compensation\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The outbreak produced multiple tornadoes, causing widespread damage, injuries, and loss of life. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the meteorological synopsis, confirmed tornadoes, impacts, and other relevant details of the outbreak.\n\n# Meteorological Synopsis\n\nA strong low-pressure system developed over the southern Great Plains on January 11, 2023, and moved eastward, bringing a cold front and a strong jet stream with it. As the system interacted with a warm and humid air mass from the Gulf of Mexico, it created a highly unstable atmosphere, conducive to thunderstorm development. The Storm Prediction Center (SPC) had predicted a moderate to high risk of severe thunderstorms and tornadoes for the region on January 12, 2023.\n\nAs the day progressed, the cold front moved eastward, and the atmosphere became increasingly unstable, leading to the formation of supercells. These supercells produced long-lived tornadoes, some of which were significant in intensity and caused considerable damage.\n\n# Confirmed Tornadoes\n\nA total of 27 tornadoes were confirmed across Alabama and Georgia on January 12, 2023, with the majority of them being EF1 or EF2 in intensity.\n\n## January 12 Event\n\nThe tornado outbreak began at around 10:00 AM CST in central Alabama, where a supercell produced a long-lived tornado that traveled over 60 miles. The tornado touched down in Chilton County and moved northeast, affecting several counties, including Autauga, Elmore, and Coosa. The tornado caused significant damage to homes, businesses, and infrastructure, with multiple injuries reported.\n\n## Selma, Alabama\n\nA significant tornado touched down in Selma, Alabama, at around 11:30 AM CST, causing widespread destruction and multiple fatalities. The tornado, which was later rated EF3, traveled over 20 miles, affecting the downtown area and several residential neighborhoods. The tornado destroyed numerous homes, businesses, and historic buildings, with reports of multiple injuries and fatalities.\n\n## Old Kingston–Titus–Equality–Lake Martin–Penton, Alabama\n\nA long-lived tornado touched down in Elmore County, Alabama, at around 12:00 PM CST, and traveled over 40 miles, affecting several counties, including Coosa and Tallapoosa. The tornado, which was later rated EF2, caused significant damage to homes, businesses, and infrastructure, with multiple injuries reported.\n\n## Hollonville–Griffin–Experiment–Locust Grove, Georgia\n\nA significant tornado touched down in Pike County, Georgia, at around 2:00 PM EST, causing widespread destruction and multiple injuries. The tornado, which was later rated EF2, traveled over 20 miles, affecting the cities of Hollonville, Griffin, and Experiment. The tornado destroyed numerous homes, businesses, and infrastructure, with reports of multiple injuries and fatalities.\n\n## East Griffin–Jenkinsburg–Jackson Lake, Georgia\n\nA long-lived tornado touched down in Spalding County, Georgia, at around 3:00 PM EST, and traveled over 30 miles, affecting several counties, including Butts and Jasper. The tornado, which was later rated EF1, caused significant damage to homes, businesses, and infrastructure, with multiple injuries reported.\n\n# Impacts\n\nThe tornado outbreak of January 12, 2023, had significant impacts on the affected areas, including casualties, closures, and power outages.\n\n## Casualties\n\nA total of 14 fatalities were confirmed across Alabama and Georgia, with multiple injuries reported. The majority of the fatalities occurred in Selma, Alabama, where a significant tornado caused widespread destruction.\n\n## Closures\n\nMultiple roads, highways, and interstates were closed due to the tornado outbreak, causing significant disruptions to traffic and commerce. Several schools and businesses were also closed, with some remaining closed for several days.\n\n## Power Outages\n\nOver 50,000 homes and businesses lost power due to the tornado outbreak, with some areas remaining without power for several days. Utility crews worked to restore power, but the process was slow due to the extent of the damage.\n\n# See Also\n\n* List of tornado outbreaks\n* List of tornadoes in the United States\n* Tornadoes of 2023\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a general overview of the tornado outbreak of January 12, 2023, and is not intended to be a comprehensive or definitive account of the event.\n\n# References\n\nThis article does not include any references or citations.\n\n# External Links\n\n* Storm Prediction Center\n* National Weather Service\n* Federal Emergency Management Agency", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Tornado_outbreak_of_January_12,_2023\" following this outline:\n\n#Meteorological synopsis\n#Confirmed tornadoes\n##January 12 event\n##Selma, Alabama\n##Old Kingston–Titus–Equality–Lake Martin–Penton, Alabama\n##Hollonville–Griffin–Experiment–Locust Grove, Georgia\n##East Griffin–Jenkinsburg–Jackson Lake, Georgia\n#Impacts\n##Casualties\n##Closures\n##Power outages\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This article provides an overview of the historiography of the Christianization of the Roman Empire, including the history of the field, the context of Roman religion, the spread of Christianity, and possible reasons for its success.\n\n**History**\n\n### Of historiography\n\nThe study of the Christianization of the Roman Empire has a long and varied history. Early Christian writers, such as Eusebius and Origen, wrote about the spread of Christianity and its relationship to the Roman Empire. In the Middle Ages, Christian scholars continued to write about the history of the Church and its role in the Empire. However, it was not until the 19th and 20th centuries that the field of historiography began to take shape as a distinct discipline.\n\n### Roman religion\n\nRoman religion played a significant role in the Christianization of the Roman Empire. The Roman pantheon of gods and goddesses was diverse and complex, and the Roman state was deeply invested in maintaining the traditional cults and rituals. However, the Roman Empire was also characterized by a high degree of religious tolerance, and many different cults and sects were able to flourish within its borders.\n\n#### Context and other evidence\n\nThe Roman Empire was a vast and diverse entity, encompassing many different cultures and regions. The spread of Christianity was influenced by a range of factors, including politics, economics, and social change. Archaeological evidence, such as inscriptions and artifacts, provides valuable insights into the lives of early Christians and the spread of Christianity.\n\n### Spread of Christianity\n\nThe spread of Christianity is a complex and multifaceted process that has been studied and debated by scholars for centuries. This section provides an overview of the main stages of the spread of Christianity, from its origins in the 1st century to the 8th century.\n\n#### Origin\n\nChristianity originated in the 1st century in the Roman province of Judea, where Jesus of Nazareth preached and was crucified. The early Christian community was centered in Jerusalem, but it quickly spread to other parts of the Empire, including Antioch and Rome.\n\n#### Reception and growth in Roman society\n\nThe reception of Christianity in Roman society was initially mixed. Some Romans saw Christianity as a threat to traditional values and customs, while others were attracted to its message of love and redemption. The growth of Christianity was facilitated by the Empire's extensive road network, which allowed for easy communication and travel.\n\n#### Under Constantine and his Christian successors\n\nThe conversion of Constantine to Christianity in the 4th century marked a significant turning point in the spread of Christianity. Constantine's support for Christianity helped to establish it as a major force in the Empire, and his successors continued to promote the faith.\n\n#### Theodosius I\n\nTheodosius I, who ruled from 378 to 395, is often regarded as one of the most important Christian emperors of the Roman Empire. He issued a series of laws that promoted Christianity and suppressed paganism, and he played a key role in the Council of Constantinople, which helped to establish the Nicene Creed as the orthodox Christian doctrine.\n\n#### Theodosius II and Pope Leo I\n\nTheodosius II, who ruled from 408 to 450, continued to promote Christianity, and his relationship with Pope Leo I helped to establish the authority of the papacy. The Council of Chalcedon, which was convened in 451, helped to clarify the nature of Christ and the authority of the Church.\n\n### Sixth to eighth centuries\n\nThe 6th to 8th centuries saw significant challenges to the Christianization of the Roman Empire, including the rise of Islam and the decline of the Western Roman Empire. However, the Eastern Roman Empire, also known as the Byzantine Empire, continued to thrive, and the spread of Christianity continued in many parts of the world.\n\n## Mathematical modelling\n\nMathematical modelling has been used to study the spread of Christianity in the Roman Empire. This approach allows researchers to analyze complex historical data and make predictions about the spread of the faith.\n\n## Possible reasons for a top-down spread\n\nA top-down approach to the spread of Christianity suggests that the faith was promoted by the Roman state and its officials. This section examines some possible reasons for a top-down spread of Christianity.\n\n### Traditional conflict models\n\nTraditional conflict models suggest that the spread of Christianity was facilitated by conflict between different groups within the Roman Empire. This approach emphasizes the role of persecution and violence in the spread of the faith.\n\n### Violence and temple destruction\n\nViolence and temple destruction were significant factors in the spread of Christianity. The destruction of pagan temples and the persecution of pagans helped to promote the faith and establish its dominance.\n\n### Socio-economic factors\n\nSocio-economic factors, such as poverty and inequality, played a significant role in the spread of Christianity. The faith's emphasis on care for the poor and its critique of wealth and privilege helped to attract many people to the faith.\n\n### Influence of legislation\n\nThe influence of legislation was also important in the spread of Christianity. Laws that promoted Christianity and suppressed paganism helped to establish the faith as a dominant force in the Roman Empire.\n\n## Possible reasons for a grassroots spread\n\nA grassroots approach to the spread of Christianity suggests that the faith was promoted by ordinary people, rather than by the Roman state and its officials. This section examines some possible reasons for a grassroots spread of Christianity.\n\n### New ideas\n\nNew ideas, such as the concept of the Trinity and the importance of baptism, helped to attract people to the faith. The faith's emphasis on love and redemption also helped to promote its spread.\n\n#### Inclusivity and exclusivity\n\nThe inclusivity and exclusivity of the Christian community were significant factors in its spread. The faith's openness to people of all backgrounds and its emphasis on the importance of community helped to attract many people to the faith.\n\n#### Kerygma (central message)\n\nThe kerygma, or central message, of Christianity helped to promote its spread. The faith's emphasis on the importance of Jesus Christ and the significance of his death and resurrection helped to attract many people to the faith.\n\n### Social practices\n\nSocial practices, such as care for the poor and the sick, helped to promote the spread of Christianity.

The faith's emphasis on the importance of caring for the sick and its critique of the neglect of the poor helped to attract many people to the faith.\n\n#### Community\n\nCommunity was a significant factor in the spread of Christianity. The faith's emphasis on the importance of community and its critique of individualism helped to attract many people to the faith.\n\n#### Martyrdom\n\nMartyrdom was a significant factor in the spread of Christianity. The faith's emphasis on the importance of sacrifice and its critique of wealth and privilege helped to attract many people to the faith.\n\n#### Miracles\n\nMiracles were also important in the spread of Christianity. The faith's emphasis on the importance of miracles and its critique of the neglect of the poor helped to attract many people to the faith.\n\n## Alternative approaches\n\nAlternative approaches to the spread of Christianity include network theory, psychology, evolution, and diffusion of innovation.\n\n### Network theory\n\nNetwork theory suggests that the spread of Christianity was facilitated by social networks. This approach emphasizes the importance of personal relationships and social connections in the spread of the faith.\n\n### Psychology\n\nPsychology suggests that the spread of Christianity was facilitated by psychological factors, such as the need for meaning and purpose. This approach emphasizes the importance of individual motivations and desires in the spread of the faith.\n\n### Evolution\n\nEvolution suggests that the spread of Christianity was facilitated by evolutionary factors, such as the need for survival and reproduction. This approach emphasizes the importance of biological and environmental factors in the spread of the faith.\n\n### Diffusion of innovation\n\nDiffusion of innovation suggests that the spread of Christianity was facilitated by the diffusion of new ideas and practices. This approach emphasizes the importance of social and cultural factors in the spread of the faith.\n\n## Effects\n\nThe effects of the Christianization of the Roman Empire were significant and far-reaching. This section examines some of the main effects of the spread of Christianity.\n\n### Judicial penalties and clemency\n\nJudicial penalties and clemency were significant factors in the spread of Christianity.

The outbreak occurred over a three-day period, with the majority of the tornadoes touching down on March 5. This event was one of the most significant tornado outbreaks in the region in recent years, causing significant damage and loss of life.\n\n#Meteorological Synopsis\n\nThe meteorological conditions that led to the tornado outbreak were complex and involved a combination of factors. A strong low-pressure system developed over the Rocky Mountains on March 4 and began to move eastward, bringing a mass of warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico. As this warm air collided with a cold front from Canada, a dry line developed, creating a focal point for thunderstorm development.\n\n##March 5\n\nOn March 5, a strong upper-level disturbance moved into the region, providing the necessary lift for thunderstorms to develop. The combination of the warm, moist air and the cold front created a highly unstable atmosphere, with strong wind shear and low-level wind convergence. These conditions were ideal for the development of long-lived, intense tornadoes. By the afternoon of March 5, a line of thunderstorms had developed along the dry line, with several tornadoes touching down across western Iowa.\n\n##March 6–7\n\nOver the next two days, the low-pressure system continued to move eastward, with the dry line and cold front remaining stationary over the region. This led to a prolonged period of thunderstorm activity, with several more tornadoes touching down across eastern Iowa and surrounding states. While the intensity of the tornadoes decreased somewhat on March 6 and 7, the continued instability in the atmosphere allowed for the development of additional strong storms.\n\n#Confirmed Tornadoes\n\nAccording to official reports, a total of 23 tornadoes touched down during the outbreak, with the majority occurring on March 5. The tornadoes were rated on the Enhanced Fujita scale (EF scale), which rates tornadoes from EF0 (light damage) to EF5 (incredible damage).\n\n##March 5 Event\n\nA total of 15 tornadoes touched down on March 5, with the majority occurring in western Iowa.

The case drew widespread attention and sparked debates on issues of medical ethics, parental rights, and the role of the state in end-of-life decisions.\n\n# Incident\n\nOn April 7, 2022, Archie Battersbee was found unresponsive at his home in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, England. He had been participating in an online challenge, which allegedly involved strangulation. Emergency services were called, and Archie was rushed to Southend Hospital, where he was placed on life support. Despite initial hopes for his recovery, Archie's condition remained critical, and he was subsequently transferred to the Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel, London.\n\n# Legal cases\n\nAs Archie's condition deteriorated, his parents, Hollie Dance and Paul Battersbee, became concerned about the medical team's intentions to withdraw life-sustaining treatment. They argued that Archie's wishes and their own rights as parents were not being respected. In response, the hospital trust, Barts Health NHS Trust, sought a court declaration to allow them to lawfully withdraw treatment.\n\nThe case was heard in the High Court, with Justice Arbuthnot presiding. The court was presented with conflicting evidence from medical experts, with some arguing that Archie was brain-stem dead and others suggesting that he may still have some capacity for recovery. The judge ultimately ruled that it was in Archie's best interests to withdraw treatment.\n\nThe ruling was appealed by Archie's parents, but the Court of Appeal upheld the original decision. A further appeal to the Supreme Court was also unsuccessful. Throughout the legal proceedings, the media closely followed the case, with many outlets highlighting the emotional and complex nature of the situation.\n\n# Inquest\n\nAs the legal battle surrounding Archie's treatment continued, an inquest into the circumstances of his injury was also launched.

His teachings had a profound impact on Western philosophy, influencing many prominent thinkers, including the early Christian theologians and the Islamic philosophers. Plotinus's philosophy is characterized by its emphasis on the spiritual and the eternal, and his ideas continue to be studied and debated by scholars and philosophers to this day.\n\nBiography\n----------\n\n### Expedition to Persia and return to Rome\n\nPlotinus was born in Lycopolis, Egypt, around 205 AD. Little is known about his early life, but it is believed that he was born into a wealthy family and received a traditional Greek education. In 243 AD, Plotinus joined the Roman Emperor Gordian III's expedition to Persia, which was an attempt to conquer the Sassanid Empire. However, the expedition was unsuccessful, and Gordian III was killed. Plotinus managed to escape and returned to Rome, where he became a student of the philosopher Ammonius Saccas.\n\n### Later life\n\nIn Rome, Plotinus taught philosophy and attracted a large following of students, including the future Emperor Gallienus and his wife, Salonina. Plotinus's teachings were so influential that he was invited to the imperial court, where he became a close friend and advisor to the emperor. Despite his success, Plotinus remained humble and continued to teach and write until his death in 270 AD. He was succeeded by his student, Porphyry, who edited and published his teacher's writings.\n\nMajor ideas\n------------\n\n### The One\n\nAt the heart of Plotinus's philosophy is the concept of the One, which is the ultimate reality and the source of all existence. The One is beyond human comprehension and is described as a unity that transcends all duality. It is the source of all being, and everything that exists is a manifestation of the One.\n\n### Emanation by the One\n\nAccording to Plotinus, the One emanates the universe through a process of necessary and eternal emanation. The first emanation is the Nous, which is the realm of thought and intellect. The Nous contains all the Platonic Forms, which are the eternal and immutable templates of all things. The Nous is followed by the World Soul, which is the source of all life and movement in the universe.\n\n### The true human and happiness\n\nPlotinus believed that the true human is the soul, which is a spark of the divine. The soul is immortal and eternal, and its goal is to return to its source in the One. Happiness is achieved through the contemplation of the One and the attainment of spiritual union with it.\n\n### Henosis\n\nHenosis is the process of spiritual union with the One, which is the ultimate goal of human existence. It is achieved through the practice of philosophy, contemplation, and the cultivation of virtues. Henosis is a state of ecstasy and bliss, in which the individual soul becomes one with the One.\n\nRelation with contemporary philosophy and religion\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n### Plotinus's Relation to Plato\n\nPlotinus was deeply influenced by the philosophy of Plato, and his teachings can be seen as a development of Platonic thought. However, Plotinus also criticized certain aspects of Plato's philosophy, such as his theory of Forms. Plotinus believed that the Forms are not separate entities but are rather aspects of the One.\n\n### Plotinus and the Gnostics\n\nPlotinus was critical of the Gnostics, who believed in a radical dualism between the material and spiritual worlds. Plotinus argued that the material world is not inherently evil but is rather a manifestation of the One.\n\n### Against causal astrology\n\nPlotinus was also critical of astrology, which he believed was a form of fatalism that denied human free will. He argued that the stars and planets have no causal influence on human affairs and that our lives are determined by our choices and actions.\n\nFilm studies\n------------\n\nThere are no film studies specifically focused on Plotinus, but his ideas have influenced many filmmakers and artists. His concept of the One and the idea of henosis have been explored in various films and artistic works.\n\nInfluence\n----------\n\n### Ancient world\n\nPlotinus's teachings had a profound impact on the ancient world, influencing many prominent thinkers, including the early Christian theologians and the Islamic philosophers. His ideas about the One and the concept of henosis were particularly influential.\n\n### Christianity\n\nPlotinus's ideas about the One and the concept of henosis were influential in the development of Christian theology. The early Christian theologians, such as Origen and Augustine, were deeply influenced by Plotinus's teachings.\n\n### Islam\n\nPlotinus's ideas were also influential in the development of Islamic philosophy, particularly in the teachings of the Sufis. The Sufis believed in the concept of wahdat al-wujud, or the unity of existence, which is similar to Plotinus's idea of the One.\n\n### Judaism\n\nPlotinus's ideas were also influential in Jewish philosophy, particularly in the teachings of the Kabbalists. The Kabbalists believed in the concept of Ein Sof, or the infinite, which is similar to Plotinus's idea of the One.\n\n### Renaissance\n\nDuring the Renaissance, Plotinus's ideas were rediscovered and influential in the development of Renaissance humanism. The humanists, such as Marsilio Ficino and Pico della Mirandola, were deeply influenced by Plotinus's teachings.\n\n### Great Britain\n\nIn Great Britain, Plotinus's ideas were influential in the development of British Idealism, particularly in the teachings of philosophers such as F.H. Bradley and Bernard Bosanquet.\n\n### India\n\nIn India, Plotinus's ideas were influential in the development of Indian philosophy, particularly in the teachings of the Advaita Vedantists. The Advaita Vedantists believed in the concept of Brahman, or the ultimate reality, which is similar to Plotinus's idea of the One.\n\nSee also\n----------\n\n* Neoplatonism\n* Plato\n* Aristotle\n* Stoicism\n* Epicureanism\n\nNotes\n------\n\nThis article is a general overview of Plotinus's life and teachings.

The battle was a continuation of the larger War in Donbas, which started in 2014, and was marked by a significant escalation of hostilities in 2022.\n\n#Background\n\n##War in Donbas\n\nThe War in Donbas was a conflict that began in April 2014, following the annexation of Crimea by Russia. The conflict pitted Ukrainian government forces against Russian-backed separatists in the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts of eastern Ukraine. The war resulted in significant human suffering, displacement, and economic damage to the region.\n\n##Prior operations\n\nIn the years leading up to the 2022 battle, there were several military operations and clashes between Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatists. These operations included the Battle of Debaltseve in 2015 and the Battle of Avdiivka in 2017. Despite several ceasefire agreements, the conflict continued to simmer, with periodic outbreaks of violence.\n\n#Prelude\n\n##Russian objectives\n\nIn the months leading up to the 2022 battle, Russia amassed a significant military presence along the Ukrainian border. The Russian objectives were not entirely clear, but it was believed that they aimed to capture key cities and infrastructure in the Donbas region, including the cities of Sloviansk, Kramatorsk, and Bakhmut. Russia also sought to create a land bridge between the Donbas region and the Crimean Peninsula, which it had annexed in 2014.\n\n#Opposing forces and foreign involvement\n\n##Russian and pro-Russian forces\n\nThe Russian military had a significant presence in the Donbas region, with estimates suggesting that between 80,000 to 100,000 troops were deployed along the Ukrainian border. The Russian military was supported by pro-Russian separatist groups, including the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic. These groups were equipped with advanced Russian military hardware, including tanks, artillery, and surface-to-air missile systems.\n\n##Ukrainian forces\n\nThe Ukrainian military had a significant presence in the Donbas region, with estimates suggesting that between 40,000 to 60,000 troops were deployed in the region. The Ukrainian military was supported by a network of volunteer groups and militias, which played a significant role in the conflict. Ukraine also received significant military aid from Western countries, including the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.\n\n###Foreign support for Ukraine\n\nUkraine received significant military aid from Western countries, including the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. This aid included the provision of advanced military hardware, including Javelin anti-tank missiles and HIMARS rocket systems. Ukraine also received significant financial aid, which helped to support its military efforts.\n\n#Battle\n\n##Early operations (April–May 2022)\n\nThe battle began in earnest in April 2022, with Russian forces launching a series of attacks against Ukrainian positions in the Donbas region. The early operations were marked by significant clashes between Ukrainian and Russian forces, with both sides suffering heavy casualties.\n\n###Popasna\n\nOne of the first major battles of the campaign was fought at Popasna, a strategic town in the Luhansk Oblast. Russian forces launched a series of attacks against Ukrainian positions in the town, but were initially repelled. However, after several days of intense fighting, Russian forces were able to capture the town.\n\n###Donetsk Oblast\n\nRussian forces also launched a series of attacks against Ukrainian positions in the Donetsk Oblast. These attacks were focused on the city of Sloviansk, which was a key strategic target for Russian forces. However, Ukrainian forces were able to hold off the Russian attacks, and the city remained in Ukrainian hands.\n\n###Luhansk Oblast\n\nRussian forces made significant gains in the Luhansk Oblast, capturing several key towns and cities. These included the towns of Rubizhne and Severodonetsk, which were strategic targets for Russian forces.\n\n###Izium–Sloviansk front\n\nOne of the most significant battles of the campaign was fought on the Izium–Sloviansk front. Russian forces launched a series of attacks against Ukrainian positions in the area, but were initially repelled. However, after several days of intense fighting, Russian forces were able to break through Ukrainian lines and capture several key towns and cities.\n\n##Capture of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk, attempted advance on Sloviansk (May–July 2022)\n\nRussian forces made significant gains in the Luhansk Oblast, capturing the cities of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk. These cities were strategic targets for Russian forces, and their capture gave Russia control of the entire Luhansk Oblast.\n\n###Capture of Lyman and Sviatohirsk\n\nRussian forces also captured the towns of Lyman and Sviatohirsk, which were strategic targets in the Donetsk Oblast. The capture of these towns gave Russia control of key road junctions and infrastructure in the region.\n\n###Izium–Sloviansk front\n\nRussian forces continued to push forward on the Izium–Sloviansk front, capturing several key towns and cities. However, Ukrainian forces were able to hold off the Russian attacks, and the city of Sloviansk remained in Ukrainian hands.\n\n###Popasna–Bakhmut front\n\nRussian forces also made significant gains on the Popasna–Bakhmut front, capturing several key towns and cities. These included the towns of Soledar and Siversk, which were strategic targets for Russian forces.\n\n###Sievierodonetsk front\n\nThe battle for Sievierodonetsk was one of the most intense of the campaign. Russian forces launched a series of attacks against Ukrainian positions in the city, but were initially repelled. However, after several days of intense fighting, Russian forces were able to capture the city.\n\n###Fall of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk\n\nThe cities of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk fell to Russian forces in late June 2022. The capture of these cities gave Russia control of the entire Luhansk Oblast, and marked a significant turning point in the campaign.\n\n##Russian operational pause (4–16 July 2022)\n\nFollowing the capture of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk, Russian forces went into an operational pause. This pause was likely due to the heavy casualties suffered by Russian forces during the campaign, as well as the need to regroup and reorganize.\n\n#Renewed assaults in Donetsk Oblast (17 July–6 September 2022)\n\nRussian forces renewed their assaults in the Donetsk Oblast, launching a series of attacks against Ukrainian positions in the region.\n\n##Russian assaults near Bakhmut, Soledar, and Siversk\n\nRussian forces launched a series of attacks against Ukrainian positions near the towns of Bakhmut, Soledar, and Siversk. These attacks were likely aimed at capturing key road junctions and infrastructure in the region.\n\n##Russian assaults near Avdiivka, Pisky, and Marinka\n\nRussian forces also launched a series of attacks against Ukrainian positions near the towns of Avdiivka, Pisky, and Marinka. These attacks were likely aimed at capturing key strategic targets in the region.\n\n##Russian assaults near Sloviansk, Ukrainian counteroffensive\n\nRussian forces launched a series of attacks against Ukrainian positions near the city of Sloviansk. However, Ukrainian forces were able to hold off the Russian attacks, and launched a counteroffensive that pushed Russian forces back.\n\n#Aftermath\n\nThe battle had a significant impact on the conflict in eastern Ukraine. The capture of the Luhansk Oblast by Russian forces gave Russia control of a significant portion of the Donbas region. However, the Ukrainian military was able to hold off Russian attacks in the Donetsk Oblast, and the city of Sloviansk remained in Ukrainian hands.\n\n#Casualties\n\n##Military casualties\n\nThe battle resulted in significant military casualties on both sides. Estimates suggest that between 5,000 to 10,000 Ukrainian soldiers were killed or wounded during the battle, while between 3,000 to 6,000 Russian soldiers were killed or wounded.\n\n##Civilian casualties\n\nThe battle also resulted in significant civilian casualties. Estimates suggest that between 1,000 to 2,000 civilians were killed or wounded during the battle, with many more displaced from their homes.\n\n#See also\n\n* War in Donbas\n* Russian invasion of Ukraine (2022)\n* List of military equipment used by Russian separatist forces in Ukraine", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Battle_of_Donbas_(2022)\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##War in Donbas\n##Prior operations\n#Prelude\n##Russian objectives\n#Opposing forces and foreign involvement\n##Russian and pro-Russian forces\n##Ukrainian forces\n###Foreign support for Ukraine\n#Battle\n##Early operations (April–May 2022)\n###Popasna\n###Donetsk Oblast\n###Luhansk Oblast\n###Izium–Sloviansk front\n##Capture of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk, attempted advance on Sloviansk (May–July 2022)\n###Capture of Lyman and Sviatohirsk\n###Izium–Sloviansk front\n###Popasna–Bakhmut front\n###Sievierodonetsk front\n###Fall of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk\n##Russian operational pause (4–16 July 2022)\n#Renewed assaults in Donetsk Oblast (17 July–6 September 2022)\n##Russian assaults near Bakhmut, Soledar, and Siversk\n##Russian assaults near Avdiivka, Pisky, and Marinka\n##Russian assaults near Sloviansk, Ukrainian counteroffensive\n#Aftermath\n#Casualties\n##Military casualties\n##Civilian casualties\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The floods were caused by heavy monsoon rains and glacial lake outbursts, resulting in one of the worst humanitarian crises in the country's history.\n\n#Background\n\nPakistan is prone to flooding due to its geography, with the Indus River and its tributaries flowing through the country. The country's climate is also characterized by heavy monsoon rains during the summer months. In recent years, Pakistan has experienced several major floods, including the 2010 Pakistan floods, which affected over 20 million people.\n\nThe 2022 floods were exacerbated by climate change, which has led to increased glacial melting and more frequent extreme weather events. The country's infrastructure, including its flood protection systems, was also inadequate to withstand the heavy rainfall.\n\n#Impact\n\nThe 2022 floods had a devastating impact on Pakistan, affecting over 30 million people and causing widespread destruction.\n\n##Sindh\n\nSindh was one of the hardest-hit provinces, with the Indus River overflowing its banks and inundating large areas of land.

The center was responsible for providing aid to affected areas, including food, shelter, and medical care. The government also deployed troops to assist in the relief efforts.\n\n##International\n\nInternational organizations, countries, and the corporate sector provided significant support to the government of Pakistan in response to the floods.\n\n###International Organizations\n\nSeveral international organizations, including the United Nations, the European Union, and the Red Cross, provided aid to Pakistan. The UN provided over $10 million in aid, while the EU provided over $5 million.\n\n###Countries\n\nSeveral countries, including the United States, China, and Saudi Arabia, provided aid to Pakistan. The US provided over $10 million in aid, while China provided over $5 million.\n\n###Corporate Sector\n\nThe corporate sector also provided significant support to the government of Pakistan. Several companies, including PepsiCo and Coca-Cola, provided aid to affected areas.\n\n###Private Individuals\n\nPrivate individuals also played a significant role in responding to the floods. Many individuals donated money and goods to affected areas, while others volunteered their time to assist in the relief efforts.\n\n#Army helicopter crash\n\nOn September 1, 2022, an army helicopter crashed in the Lasbela district of Balochistan while on a relief mission.

It is one of the most iconic and enduring symbols of India, and it has been adopted as the national emblem of India. The capital was created during the reign of Emperor Ashoka in the 3rd century BCE and is considered one of the finest examples of Indian art and architecture.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\nThe Lion Capital of Ashoka was created during the reign of Emperor Ashoka, who ruled India from 269 BCE to 232 BCE. Ashoka was a powerful and influential emperor who expanded the Mauryan Empire, which was one of the largest empires in ancient India. After a brutal war in the state of Kalinga, Ashoka converted to Buddhism and became a devout follower of the faith. He spent the rest of his reign spreading Buddhism throughout his empire and building numerous monuments and sculptures to promote the faith.\n\nThe Lion Capital of Ashoka was one of the many sculptures and monuments that Ashoka built during his reign. It was originally placed atop the Ashoka Pillar at Sarnath, which was one of the most important Buddhist sites in ancient India. The pillar was built to commemorate the visit of the Buddha to Sarnath, where he gave his first sermon.\n\nExcavation and Display\n---------------------\n\nThe Lion Capital of Ashoka was discovered in 1835 by British archaeologist James Prinsep. Prinsep was excavating the site of the Ashoka Pillar at Sarnath, which had been buried under debris and vegetation for centuries. The capital was found in fragments, and Prinsep had to reconstruct it from the broken pieces.\n\nAfter its discovery, the Lion Capital of Ashoka was taken to the Indian Museum in Calcutta, where it was displayed as a prized artifact. In 1950, the capital was moved to the National Museum in New Delhi, where it is currently on display.\n\nDescription\n-----------\n\nThe Lion Capital of Ashoka is a sculpture of four lions that are seated back-to-back on a circular base. The lions are carved from a single block of sandstone and are intricately detailed. Each lion is depicted with its mouth open, revealing its teeth, and its tongue lolling out of its mouth. The lions are surrounded by a frieze of carved wheels, which are known as \"dharmachakras\" or \"wheels of dharma.\"\n\nThe capital is topped by a small stone sculpture of a wheel, which is also a symbol of dharma. The wheel is surrounded by four smaller sculptures of animals, which are known as \"chaityas\" or \"shrines.\" The animals are a bull, a horse, a goat, and an elephant, which are all sacred animals in Hinduism and Buddhism.\n\nSymbolism\n----------\n\nThe Lion Capital of Ashoka is a richly symbolic sculpture that represents the values and ideals of Buddhism. The four lions that are seated back-to-back represent the four cardinal directions, which are north, south, east, and west. The lions also represent the four virtues of Buddhism, which are loving-kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity.\n\nThe dharmachakra or wheel of dharma that surrounds the lions represents the cycle of life and death, which is a central theme in Buddhism. The wheel also represents the path to enlightenment, which is the ultimate goal of Buddhism.\n\nInfluences\n------------\n\nThe Lion Capital of Ashoka was influenced by the art and architecture of ancient India, particularly the sculptures and monuments of the Mauryan Empire. The capital was also influenced by the art and architecture of ancient Greece, which was introduced to India through the Indo-Greek Kingdom.\n\nThe Lion Capital of Ashoka has had a profound influence on Indian art and architecture, particularly in the development of Buddhist sculpture and architecture. The capital has also been adopted as a national symbol of India and has been featured on numerous coins, stamps, and other national emblems.\n\nLegacy\n--------\n\nThe Lion Capital of Ashoka is one of the most iconic and enduring symbols of India, and it has been adopted as the national emblem of India. The capital has been featured on numerous coins, stamps, and other national emblems, and it is considered one of the finest examples of Indian art and architecture.\n\nThe Lion Capital of Ashoka has also been recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which is a testament to its cultural and historical significance. The capital continues to inspire artists, architects, and scholars around the world, and it remains one of the most beloved and revered symbols of India.\n\nReconstructions\n----------------\n\nSeveral reconstructions of the Lion Capital of Ashoka have been made over the years, including a full-scale replica that was built at the National Museum in New Delhi. The replica was built using the same techniques and materials as the original capital, and it provides a detailed glimpse into the construction and design of the sculpture.\n\nRelated Sculpture\n------------------\n\nThe Lion Capital of Ashoka is part of a larger series of sculptures and monuments that were built during the reign of Emperor Ashoka. Other notable sculptures and monuments include the Ashoka Pillar at Sarnath, the Ashoka Pillar at Vaishali, and the Ashoka Stupa at Sanchi.\n\nThese sculptures and monuments are considered some of the finest examples of Indian art and architecture, and they provide a glimpse into the cultural and historical context of ancient India.\n\nNotes\n------\n\nThe Lion Capital of Ashoka is a highly detailed and intricately carved sculpture that requires careful observation and study. The capital has been extensively studied and analyzed by scholars and art historians, and it continues to inspire new interpretations and insights.\n\nThe capital is also a highly symbolic sculpture that represents the values and ideals of Buddhism. The four lions that are seated back-to-back represent the four cardinal directions, which are north, south, east, and west.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nThis article does not include any references or citations.\n\nCited Works\n------------\n\nThis article does not include any cited works.\n\nFurther Reading\n----------------\n\nFor further reading on the Lion Capital of Ashoka, see:\n\n* \"The Lion Capital of Ashoka\" by James Prinsep\n* \"The Ashoka Pillars\" by Alexander Cunningham\n* \"The Art of India\" by Hermann Goetz\n* \"The History of Indian Art\" by Nihar Ranjan Ray\n\nExternal Links\n---------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Lion_Capital_of_Ashoka\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n#Excavation and display\n#Description\n#Symbolism\n#Influences\n#Legacy\n#Reconstructions\n#Related sculpture\n#Notes\n#References\n#Cited works\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The election was a significant event in Kenyan politics, marking the end of President Uhuru Kenyatta's second and final term in office. The election was characterized by a highly competitive presidential contest between Raila Odinga and William Ruto, with both candidates vying to succeed Kenyatta.\n\n#Background\n\nThe 2022 Kenyan general election was the seventh general election since the country's transition to multiparty democracy in 1992. The election was held against the backdrop of a struggling economy, rising inflation, and high unemployment rates. The outgoing President Uhuru Kenyatta had served two terms, and the election presented an opportunity for a new leader to take the reins of power. The election was also significant as it marked the first time a presidential candidate would be elected under the new constitution introduced in 2010.\n\n#Electoral system\n\nKenya's electoral system is based on a multi-party system, where citizens vote for their preferred candidates in a secret ballot. The presidential election is held using a two-round system, where a candidate must win at least 50% of the total votes cast plus one vote to be declared the winner. If no candidate achieves this, a runoff election is held between the top two candidates. The National Assembly and Senate are elected using a first-past-the-post system.\n\n#Presidential candidates\n\nA total of four candidates contested the presidential election:\n\n1. Raila Odinga - Azimio la Umoja - One Kenya Alliance\n2. William Ruto - Kenya Kwanza Alliance\n3. George Wajackoyah - Roots Party of Kenya\n4. David Mwaure Waihiga - Agano Party\n\n#Campaign\n\n##Presidential nomination\n\nThe presidential nomination process began in April 2022, with each party holding primaries to select its flag bearer. Raila Odinga was nominated by the Azimio la Umoja - One Kenya Alliance, while William Ruto was nominated by the Kenya Kwanza Alliance.\n\n##Deputy presidential nomination\n\nEach presidential candidate selected a running mate to accompany them on the ticket. Raila Odinga selected Martha Karua, a seasoned politician and lawyer, while William Ruto selected Rigathi Gachagua, a businessman and politician.\n\n##Manifestos\n\nEach presidential candidate launched a manifesto outlining their vision and policies for the country. Raila Odinga's manifesto focused on economic growth, job creation, and social welfare, while William Ruto's manifesto emphasized on economic transformation, agricultural development, and youth empowerment.\n\n##Electoral candidates debates\n\nThe presidential candidates participated in two televised debates, where they answered questions on various issues affecting the country. The debates provided an opportunity for citizens to engage with the candidates and assess their policies and leadership qualities.\n\n##Campaign season\n\nThe campaign season was marked by intense rallies, meetings, and door-to-door canvassing. The candidates traversed the country, selling their manifestos and seeking support from voters. The campaign season was also characterized by allegations of vote-buying, intimidation, and misinformation.\n\n#Conduct\n\n##Mass voter listing\n\nThe Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) conducted a mass voter listing exercise to update the voter register. The exercise was marked by low turnout in some areas, with concerns raised about the accuracy of the register.\n\n##Electoral candidates clearance\n\nThe IEBC cleared all four presidential candidates to contest the election, after verifying their academic qualifications, citizenship, and other requirements.\n\n##IEBC preparation for general election\n\nThe IEBC prepared for the general election by recruiting poll officials, distributing voting materials, and setting up polling stations. The commission also established a results transmission system to facilitate the timely announcement of results.\n\n##General elections\n\nThe general election was held on August 9, 2022, with voters casting ballots for the President, National Assembly, and Senate. The election was peaceful, with no major incidents reported.\n\n##Interference\n\nThere were allegations of interference in the electoral process, with some candidates accusing their opponents of vote-buying and intimidation. The IEBC was also accused of bias and incompetence.\n\n#Opinion polls\n\nOpinion polls were conducted throughout the campaign season to gauge public opinion on the candidates and their policies. The polls showed a tight contest between Raila Odinga and William Ruto, with neither candidate able to secure a clear lead.\n\n##Graphical summary of opinion polls\n\nA graphical summary of opinion polls showed that Raila Odinga led in some polls, while William Ruto led in others. The polls also showed that a significant proportion of voters were undecided.\n\n#Results and reactions\n\n##President\n\nThe presidential election results were announced on August 15, 2022, with William Ruto declared the winner. Ruto secured 50.49% of the total votes cast, while Raila Odinga secured 48.85%. The results were disputed by Raila Odinga, who alleged that the election was rigged.\n\n###By county\n\nThe presidential election results by county showed that William Ruto performed well in his strongholds in the Rift Valley and Western regions, while Raila Odinga performed well in his strongholds in the Lake and Coast regions.\n\n##Parliament\n\n###National Assembly\n\nThe National Assembly election results showed that the Kenya Kwanza Alliance secured a majority of seats, with the Azimio la Umoja - One Kenya Alliance coming second.\n\n###Senate\n\nThe Senate election results showed that the Kenya Kwanza Alliance secured a majority of seats, with the Azimio la Umoja - One Kenya Alliance coming second.\n\n#Misinformation on various social media\n\nThe election was marked by misinformation on social media, with false news and propaganda spread about the candidates and their policies. The misinformation was exacerbated by the lack of regulation of social media platforms.\n\n#Notes\n\nThe 2022 Kenyan general election was a significant event in Kenyan politics, marking the end of President Uhuru Kenyatta's second and final term in office. The election was characterized by a highly competitive presidential contest between Raila Odinga and William Ruto, with both candidates vying to succeed Kenyatta.

The tenure of the current assembly elected in 2018 will end on 22 March 2023.\n\nBackground\n\n### TTAADC elections\n\nThe Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council (TTAADC) election was held in April 2021. The Indigenous Peoples Front of Tripura (IPFT) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) contested the election as allies, but the IPFT accused the BJP of not honoring the alliance agreement and fielding candidates in many seats without consulting the IPFT. The BJP and its allies won 28 seats, while the Left parties and the Congress won 12 seats. The Tipra Motha Party (TMP), a new party formed by Pradyot Deb Barma, the scion of the royal family of Tripura, won 18 seats. The TMP emerged as the main opposition party in the TTAADC.\n\n### Major political defections\n\nIn 2021, several MLAs of the Indigenous Peoples Front of Tripura (IPFT) defected to the Tipra Motha Party (TMP). The IPFT has two MLAs in the assembly, and both defected to the TMP. The TMP also received support from several other MLAs, including some from the BJP. The Congress party also suffered defections, with several MLAs joining the BJP and the TMP.\n\nSchedule\n\nThe Election Commission of India announced the schedule for the Tripura Legislative Assembly election on 18 January 2023. The election will be held in a single phase on 16 February 2023. The counting of votes will take place on 2 March 2023.\n\nParties and Alliances\n\n### National Democratic Alliance\n\nThe National Democratic Alliance (NDA) is led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The BJP will contest all 60 seats. The Indigenous Peoples Front of Tripura (IPFT) will contest 6 seats as an ally of the BJP.\n\n### Secular Democratic Forces\n\nThe Secular Democratic Forces is an alliance of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI-M), the Communist Party of India (CPI), the Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP), and the All India Forward Bloc (AIFB). The CPI-M will contest 47 seats, while the CPI will contest 13 seats. The RSP will contest 1 seat, and the AIFB will contest 1 seat.\n\n### Tipra Motha Party\n\nThe Tipra Motha Party (TMP) will contest all 60 seats. The TMP is a new party formed by Pradyot Deb Barma, the scion of the royal family of Tripura.\n\n### Others\n\nThe Indian National Congress will contest all 60 seats.

The Congress party announced its list of candidates on 31 January 2023.\n\nIssues\n\n### 10323 Teachers batch\n\nThe 10323 teachers batch is a major issue in the election. The teachers were appointed in 2010, but their appointments were cancelled by the High Court in 2014. The teachers have been protesting for several years, demanding regularization of their services. The BJP government has promised to regularize the services of the teachers, but the opposition parties have accused the government of not fulfilling its promise.\n\n### Tipraland Movement\n\nThe Tipraland Movement is a demand for a separate state for the indigenous people of Tripura. The movement has been led by the Indigenous Peoples Front of Tripura (IPFT) and the Tipra Motha Party (TMP). The BJP has promised to consider the demand for a separate state, but the opposition parties have accused the government of not taking any concrete steps to address the demand.\n\n### Bru refugees\n\nThe Bru refugees are a major issue in the election. The Bru people were displaced from Mizoram in 1997 and have been living in relief camps in Tripura.

The mission involves crashing a spacecraft into an asteroid to alter its trajectory, with the ultimate goal of developing a technique to prevent potentially hazardous asteroids from colliding with Earth. The DART mission is a critical step in the development of asteroid deflection technologies and has significant implications for planetary defense.\n\n#Mission history\n\nThe concept of the DART mission was first proposed in 2011 by NASA's Planetary Science Division. The mission was initially called the \"Asteroid Redirect Mission\" (ARM) and was designed to redirect an asteroid into lunar orbit. However, the mission was later modified to focus on asteroid deflection, and the name was changed to the Double Asteroid Redirection Test.\n\nIn 2017, NASA approved the DART mission and awarded a contract to the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) to design and build the spacecraft. The mission is being managed by NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office (PDCO), which is responsible for coordinating asteroid detection and deflection efforts.\n\n#Description\n\n##Spacecraft\n\nThe DART spacecraft is a small, box-shaped vehicle with a mass of approximately 570 kilograms (1,260 pounds). The spacecraft is equipped with a range of instruments and systems, including a camera, solar arrays, an antenna, and an ion thruster.\n\n###Camera\n\nThe DART spacecraft is equipped with a single camera called the Didymos Reconnaissance and Asteroid Camera for Optical navigation (DRACO). The camera is designed to capture images of the target asteroid and provide navigation data for the spacecraft.\n\n###Solar arrays\n\nThe DART spacecraft is powered by two solar arrays, which provide a total of 100 watts of power. The solar arrays are designed to be compact and lightweight, allowing for efficient energy production.\n\n###Antenna\n\nThe DART spacecraft is equipped with a high-gain antenna, which provides communication with Earth. The antenna is designed to transmit data at a rate of up to 2 kilobits per second.\n\n###Ion thruster\n\nThe DART spacecraft is equipped with an ion thruster, which provides propulsion for the spacecraft. The ion thruster uses xenon gas to generate thrust and is designed to be efficient and reliable.\n\n##Secondary spacecraft\n\nIn addition to the primary DART spacecraft, a secondary spacecraft called the Light Italian CubeSat for Imaging Asteroids (LICIACube) is being developed by the Italian Space Agency (ASI). LICIACube is a small, cube-shaped spacecraft that will be deployed from the DART spacecraft and will capture images of the impact.\n\n##Effect of the impact on Dimorphos and Didymos\n\nThe DART mission is designed to test the effects of a kinetic impact on an asteroid's trajectory. The impact is expected to alter the orbit of the target asteroid, Dimorphos, by approximately 1%. The effects of the impact on the asteroid's orbit will be monitored by ground-based telescopes and the LICIACube spacecraft.\n\n##Observations of the impact\n\nThe impact will be observed by a range of ground-based telescopes, including the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope. The telescopes will capture images and spectra of the impact and provide data on the effects of the impact on the asteroid's orbit.\n\n##Follow-up mission\n\nThe DART mission is the first part of a larger asteroid deflection mission called the Asteroid Impact and Deflection Assessment (AIDA) mission. The AIDA mission will involve a follow-up spacecraft that will be launched in 2027 to investigate the effects of the impact on the target asteroid.\n\n##AIDA mission architecture\n\nThe AIDA mission is a joint NASA-ESA mission that will involve two spacecraft: the DART spacecraft and the European Space Agency's (ESA) Hera spacecraft.

The incident was a significant event in the conflict, resulting in the loss of a major Russian warship and raising questions about the military's capabilities and strategies. This article provides an overview of the background, sinking, and aftermath of the Moskva.\n\n# Background\n\nThe Moskva was a Slava-class cruiser commissioned in 1983 and named after the Russian capital city. The ship was designed for anti-surface warfare and air defense, and was one of the most advanced warships in the Russian Navy at the time of its commissioning. In the years leading up to the sinking, the Moskva underwent several modernizations and upgrades, including the installation of new air defense systems and electronic warfare capabilities.\n\nIn February 2022, Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine, with the Moskva playing a key role in the naval component of the operation. The ship was deployed to the Black Sea, where it was tasked with providing air defense and supporting amphibious landings. The Moskva was also involved in the blockade of Ukrainian ports, including the strategic port city of Odessa.\n\n# Sinking\n\n## Ukrainian account\n\nAccording to the Ukrainian military, the Moskva was struck by two Neptune anti-ship missiles fired from the coast of Odessa Oblast on the evening of April 13, 2022. The missiles, which have a range of approximately 280 kilometers, were reportedly launched from a mobile launcher. Ukrainian officials claimed that the ship was hit in the ammunition magazine, causing a massive explosion and fire that rendered the vessel inoperable.\n\n## Russian account\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense initially reported that the Moskva had suffered a fire caused by a technical malfunction, which had spread to the ammunition storage. The ministry claimed that the crew had been evacuated and that the ship was being towed to a safe location for repairs. However, it later emerged that the ship had sunk while being towed, resulting in the loss of an unknown number of lives.\n\n## Other early observations\n\nEyewitnesses and observers in the region reported seeing a large explosion and fire on the Moskva, followed by a rapid deterioration of the ship's condition. Satellite imagery and video footage showed the ship listing heavily to one side before eventually disappearing beneath the surface.\n\n## Missile strike\n\nThe Ukrainian military's claim that the Moskva was struck by Neptune missiles was supported by several lines of evidence. Video footage showed the launch of two missiles from the coast of Odessa Oblast, which were tracked by Ukrainian radar systems as they flew towards the Moskva. The Russian ship's air defense systems, which included the S-300F Fort missile system, were apparently unable to int", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Sinking_of_the_Moskva\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Sinking\n##Ukrainian account\n##Russian account\n##Other early observations\n##Missile strike\n##Images and video of the sinking ship\n#Casualties\n#Impact\n#Aftermath\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Prigozhin's early life and career were marked by controversy and imprisonment, but he eventually rose to prominence as the founder of the Wagner Group, a private military company with ties to the Russian government.\n\n# Early life and education\n\nYevgeny Prigozhin was born on June 1, 1961, in Leningrad, Soviet Union (now Saint Petersburg, Russia). His early life is not well-documented, but it is known that he grew up in a family of modest means and was raised by his mother, a shop assistant. Prigozhin's father was reportedly a mechanic who died when Yevgeny was just a child.\n\nPrigozhin attended a local secondary school in Leningrad, where he showed little interest in academics. Instead, he was drawn to sports, particularly boxing, which he would later credit with teaching him discipline and toughness.\n\n## Criminal history and imprisonment\n\nIn 1979, Prigozhin was arrested for robbery and theft, and he was subsequently sentenced to 12 years in prison. He served nine years before being released in 1988. During his time in prison, Prigozhin reportedly became involved with organized crime figures, which would later influence his business dealings.\n\n# Early career and rise to prominence\n\nAfter his release from prison, Prigozhin began working as a hot dog vendor in Leningrad. He eventually expanded his business to include several restaurants and cafes, which became popular with the city's elite.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Prigozhin became involved in the Saint Petersburg underworld, where he reportedly worked as a bodyguard and enforcer for local crime bosses. He also began to build relationships with influential figures in the city's government and business communities.\n\nPrigozhin's big break came in 1996, when he opened the Old Customs House, a high-end restaurant in Saint Petersburg that became a favorite haunt of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The restaurant's success helped establish Prigozhin as a prominent figure in Saint Petersburg's business and social circles.\n\n# Wagner Group\n\nIn 2014, Prigozhin founded the Wagner Group, a private military company that would become closely associated with the Russian government. The company's name is reportedly derived from Richard Wagner, the German composer who was a favorite of Hitler's.\n\nThe Wagner Group's early activities were shrouded in secrecy, but it is believed to have been involved in several conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. The company's fighters were reportedly deployed to support Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine, and they may have also been involved in the Russian intervention in Syria.\n\n## Russian invasion of Ukraine\n\nIn February 2022, Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine, and the Wagner Group was reportedly involved in several key battles. The company's fighters were deployed to support Russian troops in the Donbas region, where they clashed with Ukrainian forces.\n\nPrigozhin was a vocal supporter of the invasion, and he used his social media channels to promote the Wagner Group's activities and recruit new fighters. He also became a vocal critic of the Russian Ministry of Defense, which he accused of incompetence and corruption.\n\n## Conflict with Russian Ministry of Defense\n\nPrigozhin's criticism of the Russian Ministry of Defense eventually led to a public feud with Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu. In May 2023, Prigozhin accused Shoigu of corruption and incompetence, and he called for his resignation.\n\nThe feud escalated in June 2023, when Prigozhin launched a rebellion against the Russian Ministry of Defense. He accused Shoigu and other top officials of treason and corruption, and he called for their arrest.\n\n## Prigozhin as a populist critic\n\nPrigozhin's criticism of the Russian Ministry of Defense was part of a broader populist appeal that he had been cultivating for several years. He presented himself as a champion of ordinary Russians, and he accused the country's elite of corruption and incompetence.\n\nPrigozhin's populist message resonated with many Russians, who were disillusioned with the country's economic stagnation and corruption. He became a popular figure on social media, where he used his channels to promote his views and attack his enemies.\n\n## June 2023 rebellion\n\nOn June 23, 2023, Prigozhin launched a rebellion against the Russian Ministry of Defense. He accused Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and other top officials of treason and corruption, and he called for their arrest.\n\nThe rebellion was short-lived, and Prigozhin was eventually forced to flee Russia. However, the incident highlighted the deep divisions within the Russian elite and the growing discontent among ordinary Russians.\n\n# Africa interests\n\nIn addition to his activities in Ukraine and the Middle East, Prigozhin has also been involved in several business ventures in Africa. He has reportedly invested in several mining and energy projects in countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo and Sudan.\n\nPrigozhin's Africa interests are believed to be closely tied to the Russian government's efforts to expand its influence on the continent. He has reportedly worked with Russian officials to promote Russian business interests in Africa, and he may have also been involved in several covert operations to support Russian-backed governments.\n\n# Internet Research Agency\n\nIn 2013, Prigozhin founded the Internet Research Agency, a company that specialized in online propaganda and disinformation. The company's activities were reportedly focused on promoting Russian interests and undermining Western democracies.\n\n## Spin-offs\n\nThe Internet Research Agency has been linked to several spin-off companies that have been involved in online disinformation campaigns. These companies have reportedly used social media platforms to promote Russian interests and undermine Western democracies.\n\n# International sanctions\n\nIn 2018, the United States imposed sanctions on Prigozhin and several of his companies, including the Internet Research Agency. The sanctions were imposed in response to Prigozhin's alleged involvement in online disinformation campaigns and his support for Russian-backed separatists in Ukraine.\n\n# U.S. criminal charges\n\nIn 2018, Prigozhin was indicted by a U.S. grand jury on charges of conspiracy to defraud the United States. The indictment alleged that Prigozhin had been involved in a scheme to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\n# Financial support for Maria Butina in 2019\n\nIn 2019, it was reported that Prigozhin had provided financial support to Maria Butina, a Russian national who had been convicted of spying on the United States. The support was reportedly provided through a network of shell companies and intermediaries.\n\n# Personal life\n\nPrigozhin is married and has two children. He is reportedly a fan of boxing and has been involved in several charitable initiatives to support Russian athletes.\n\n# Death\n\nYevgeny Prigozhin died on August 23, 2023, in a plane crash in the Tver region of Russia. The cause of the crash is still under investigation.\n\n# Awards\n\nPrigozhin has received several awards for his business and military activities, including the Order of Courage and the Order of Alexander Nevsky.\n\n# Memorials\n\nIn 2023, a memorial was erected in Saint Petersburg to honor Prigozhin's memory. The memorial features a statue of Prigozhin and a plaque commemorating his military and business achievements.\n\n# See also\n\n* Wagner Group\n* Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* Internet Research Agency\n* Maria Butina\n\n# Notes\n\nNote: This article is a general overview of Yevgeny Prigozhin's life and activities.

The community was founded in the 1880s as a rural crossroads village, with the arrival of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O) bringing growth and development to the area. The village was originally named \"Beantown\" due to the large number of bean farms in the area. In 1888, the community was officially renamed Waldorf, reportedly after a German immigrant named William Waldorf who owned a local farm.\n\nDuring the 20th century, Waldorf experienced rapid growth and development, driven by its proximity to Washington, D.C. and the expansion of the U.S. military presence in the region.

He was a dominant figure in American politics during the 1820s and 1830s, known for his strong personality, populist policies, and commitment to the principles of the Democratic Party.\n\n#Early life and education\n\nAndrew Jackson was born on March 15, 1767, in Waxhaws, a region on the border of North and South Carolina. His parents, Andrew Jackson Sr. and Elizabeth Hutchinson Jackson, were Scotch-Irish colonists who had emigrated to America in the 1750s. Jackson's father died in 1767, just before his birth, and his mother moved the family to the home of her sister and brother-in-law in the Waxhaws.\n\nJackson received a limited formal education, but he was well-read and had a keen interest in law and politics. He attended local schools and, at the age of 13, began studying law under the tutelage of a local lawyer in Salisbury, North Carolina. In 1784, Jackson moved to Nashville, Tennessee, where he continued his studies and eventually became a licensed attorney.\n\n#Revolutionary War\n\nIn 1780, at the age of 13, Jackson joined the Continental Army as a courier during the American Revolutionary War. He was captured by British soldiers in April 1781, along with his brother Robert, and held as a prisoner of war. Jackson contracted smallpox while in captivity, which left him with a scar on his forehead and a lifelong hatred of the British.\n\n#Early career\n\n##Legal career and marriage\n\nAfter the war, Jackson returned to Nashville and began practicing law. He quickly established himself as a skilled and successful attorney, and in 1787, he was appointed as a prosecuting attorney for the Western District of North Carolina. In 1796, Jackson married Rachel Donelson Robards, a woman who was already married but separated from her husband. The couple had no children together, but they raised two Native American children, Lyncoya and Andrew Jr.\n\n##Early public career\n\nIn 1796, Jackson was elected to the United States House of Representatives, where he served for one term. He was a strong supporter of the Democratic-Republican Party and advocated for the rights of the common man. In 1798, Jackson was appointed as a major general in the Tennessee militia, and he played a key role in the state's military affairs during the early years of the 19th century.\n\n##Planting career and slavery\n\nIn 1804, Jackson purchased a plantation in Tennessee, which he named the Hermitage. The plantation was worked by slaves, and Jackson became a wealthy planter and slave owner. He owned over 150 slaves at the height of his career, and he was known for his harsh treatment of them.\n\n##Duel with Dickinson and adventure with Burr\n\nIn 1806, Jackson engaged in a duel with Charles Dickinson, a man who had insulted Rachel Jackson. Jackson killed Dickinson in the duel, but he was also shot in the chest and suffered a severe injury. In 1807, Jackson became embroiled in a scandal involving Aaron Burr, the former Vice President of the United States, who was accused of treason. Jackson was a key witness in Burr's trial, and he later became embroiled in a series of duels and confrontations with Burr's supporters.\n\n#Military career\n\n##War of 1812\n\nIn 1812, Jackson was appointed as a major general in the United States Army, and he played a key role in the War of 1812. He led a successful campaign against the Creek Nation in what is now Alabama, and he defeated a large British force at the Battle of New Orleans in 1815.\n\n###Creek War\n\nThe Creek War was a conflict between the United States and the Creek Nation, which began in 1813. Jackson led a series of successful campaigns against the Creeks, and he eventually forced them to cede large tracts of land to the United States.\n\n###Battle of New Orleans\n\nThe Battle of New Orleans was a decisive victory for American forces, which took place on January 8, 1815. Jackson led a force of approximately 4,000 soldiers, who defeated a large British force of over 8,000 soldiers. The battle was a major turning point in the War of 1812, and it cemented Jackson's reputation as a skilled and courageous military leader.\n\n##First Seminole War\n\nIn 1814, Jackson led a campaign against the Seminole Nation in what is now Florida. The campaign was a series of skirmishes and battles, which eventually led to the signing of the Adams-Onís Treaty in 1819. The treaty ceded Florida to the United States, and it marked the beginning of a long and complex relationship between the United States and the Seminole Nation.\n\n#Presidential aspirations\n\n##Election of 1824\n\nIn 1824, Jackson ran for President of the United States, but he was defeated by John Quincy Adams. The election was a contentious one, with Jackson and his supporters accusing Adams of stealing the election through a \"corrupt bargain\" with Henry Clay.\n\n##Election of 1828 and death of Rachel Jackson\n\nIn 1828, Jackson ran for President again, and he was elected in a landslide victory. However, his wife Rachel died just before his inauguration, which was a devastating blow to Jackson.\n\n#Presidency (1829–1837)\n\n##Inauguration\n\nJackson's inauguration was a raucous and disorderly affair, with thousands of his supporters descending on Washington, D.C. to celebrate his victory. Jackson was the first President to hold a public inauguration, and it marked a new era of popular politics in the United States.\n\n##Reforms and rotation in office\n\nJackson was a strong advocate for reform, and he implemented a number of policies aimed at reducing corruption and increasing efficiency in government. He also introduced the concept of rotation in office, which held that government officials should serve for limited terms and then return to private life.\n\n##Petticoat affair\n\nThe Petticoat Affair was a scandal that involved Jackson's Secretary of War, John Eaton, who was accused of having an affair with a woman named Margaret Timberlake. The scandal led to a rift between Jackson and his Vice President, John Calhoun, and it ultimately led to the resignation of several members of Jackson's cabinet.\n\n##Indian Removal Act\n\nThe Indian Removal Act was a law that authorized the forced relocation of tens of thousands of Native Americans from their ancestral lands to Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma). The law was a major priority for Jackson, who believed that it was necessary to remove Native Americans from their lands in order to make way for white settlers.\n\n##Nullification crisis\n\nThe Nullification Crisis was a controversy that arose in 1832, when the state of South Carolina threatened to nullify a federal tariff law. Jackson responded by issuing a proclamation that asserted the authority of the federal government and threatened to use force to enforce the law.\n\n##Bank War and Election of 1832\n\n###Bank veto\n\nIn 1832, Jackson vetoed a bill to re-charter the Second Bank of the United States, which was a major financial institution that was opposed by many of Jackson's supporters. The veto was a major victory for Jackson, who believed that the bank was a symbol of elitism and corruption.\n\n###Election of 1832\n\nIn 1832, Jackson ran for re-election, and he was opposed by Henry Clay, who was a strong supporter of the bank. Jackson won the election in a landslide victory, which cemented his reputation as a popular and effective leader.\n\n###Removal of deposits and censure\n\nIn 1833, Jackson removed government deposits from the Second Bank of the United States and placed them in state banks, which was a major blow to the bank's power. The move was opposed by many in Congress, who censured Jackson for his actions.\n\n###Panic of 1837\n\nThe Panic of 1837 was a major economic downturn that occurred in the final year of Jackson's presidency. The panic was caused by a combination of factors, including a decline in the price of cotton and a speculative bubble in land prices.\n\n##Physical assault and assassination attempt\n\nIn 1835, Jackson was the target of an assassination attempt by a man named Richard Lawrence, who fired two pistols at the President. Both pistols misfired, and Jackson was unharmed.\n\n##Slavery\n\nJackson was a slave owner and a strong supporter of the institution of slavery. He believed that slavery was a necessary evil and that it was protected by the Constitution.\n\n##Foreign affairs\n\nJackson's foreign policy was marked by a series of conflicts and controversies, including a border dispute with Mexico and a trade war with Great Britain.\n\n##Judiciary\n\nJackson was a strong critic of the judiciary, which he believed was too powerful and too prone to overstep its authority. He vetoed several bills aimed at expanding the power of the courts and clashed with the Supreme Court over several issues.\n\n##States admitted to the Union\n\nDuring Jackson's presidency, two new states were admitted to the Union: Arkansas and Michigan.\n\n#Later life and death (1837–1845)\n\nAfter leaving office, Jackson returned to the Hermitage, where he lived out the remainder of his life. He died on June 8, 1845, at the age of 78.\n\n#Personal life\n\n##Family\n\nJackson was a devoted husband and father, and he was known for his strong family values. He had no children of his own, but he raised two Native American children, Lyncoya and Andrew Jr.\n\n##Temperament\n\nJackson was known for his hot temper and his tendency to hold grudges. He was a fierce competitor and a strong advocate for his own interests.\n\n##Religious faith\n\nJackson was a devout Christian and a strong supporter of the Presbyterian Church.\n\n#Legacy\n\nJackson's legacy is complex and multifaceted, and it continues to be debated by historians and scholars today. He is remembered as a strong and effective leader who expanded American democracy and protected American interests. However, he is also criticized for his role in the forced relocation of Native Americans and his support for the institution of slavery.\n\n#Writings\n\nJackson was a prolific writer, and he left behind a large collection of letters, speeches, and other writings.\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is based on a variety of sources, including biographies, histories, and primary documents.\n\n#References\n\nThis article does not include any citations or references.\n\n#Bibliography\n\n##Biographies\n\n*   Remini, Robert V. \"Andrew Jackson.\" New York: Twayne Publishers, 1966.\n*   Brands, H.W. \"Andrew Jackson: His Life and Times.\" New York: Doubleday, 2005.\n\n##Books\n\n*   Latner, Richard B. \"The Presidency of Andrew Jackson: White House Politics, 1829-1837.\" Athens, GA: University of Georgia Press, 1979.\n*   Wilentz, Sean. \"Andrew Jackson.\" New York: Times Books, 2005.\n\n##Journal articles and dissertations\n\n*   Buchanan, Thomas C. \"The Quest for the Lost Cause: Andrew Jackson and the Legend of the Tennessee Volunteers.\" Tennessee Historical Quarterly 65 (2006): 254-275.\n*   Remini, Robert V. \"Andrew Jackson and the Indians.\" Journal of the Early Republic 10 (1990): 45-75.\n\n##Primary sources\n\n*   Jackson, Andrew. \"The Papers of Andrew Jackson.\" Edited by Sam B.

The outbreak was characterized by multiple days of severe thunderstorms, with numerous tornadoes touching down across several states. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the meteorological synopsis, confirmed tornadoes, non-tornadic impacts, and aftermath of the outbreak.\n\n# Meteorological Synopsis\n\n## April 4–5\n\nA low-pressure system developed over the southern Great Plains on April 4, 2022, and began to move eastward. As the system interacted with a warm front stretching across the southeastern United States, it created a highly unstable atmosphere conducive to severe thunderstorms. A strong cold front trailing behind the low-pressure system provided the necessary lift to trigger the development of supercell thunderstorms. These storms produced numerous tornadoes, large hail, and damaging winds across parts of Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi.\n\n## April 6–7\n\nAs the low-pressure system continued to move eastward, it brought the warm front and cold front into the same region, creating a highly volatile atmosphere. The combination of strong wind shear, moisture, and instability led to the development of intense supercell thunderstorms, which produced long-lived tornadoes across parts of Georgia, Alabama, and Tennessee. The storms were fueled by a strong jet stream, which provided the necessary energy for the storms to sustain themselves.\n\n# Confirmed Tornadoes\n\n## April 4 Event\n\nA total of 17 tornadoes were confirmed on April 4, 2022, across parts of Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. The strongest tornado of the day was an EF2 tornado that touched down in Caddo Parish, Louisiana, causing significant damage to homes and businesses. The tornado had wind speeds of up to 120 mph and a maximum path length of 10 miles.\n\n## April 5 Event\n\nOn April 5, 2022, 23 tornadoes were confirmed across parts of Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia. The strongest tornado of the day was an EF3 tornado that touched down in Winston County, Mississippi, causing widespread damage to homes and businesses. The tornado had wind speeds of up to 140 mph and a maximum path length of 20 miles.\n\n## April 6 Event\n\nA total of 32 tornadoes were confirmed on April 6, 2022, across parts of Georgia, Alabama, and Tennessee. The strongest tornado of the day was an EF4 tornado that touched down in Catoosa County, Georgia, causing catastrophic damage to homes and businesses. The tornado had wind speeds of up to 170 mph and a maximum path length of 30 miles.\n\n## April 7 Event\n\nOn April 7, 2022, 20 tornadoes were confirmed across parts of Georgia, Alabama, and Tennessee. The strongest tornado of the day was an EF3 tornado that touched down in Coffee County, Georgia, causing significant damage to homes and businesses. The tornado had wind speeds of up to 140 mph and a maximum path length of 20 miles.\n\n## Pembroke–Ellabell–Black Creek, Georgia\n\nA particularly devastating tornado touched down in Pembroke, Georgia, on April 6, 2022, and traveled for 30 miles before dissipating in Black Creek. The tornado was classified as an EF4 tornado, with wind speeds of up to 170 mph. The tornado caused widespread damage to homes, businesses, and infrastructure, resulting in the loss of several lives.\n\n# Non-Tornadic Impacts\n\nIn addition to the tornadoes, the outbreak produced significant non-tornadic impacts, including large hail, damaging winds, and flooding. The storms produced hail as large as baseballs in some areas, causing damage to homes and businesses. The strong winds also caused widespread power outages, with over 100,000 households affected at the peak of the outage.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe aftermath of the outbreak was marked by widespread destruction and loss of life. The storms caused over $1 billion in damages, with many communities left to pick up the pieces. Emergency responders and aid organizations worked tirelessly to provide assistance to those affected by the storms. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) declared several counties as disaster areas, making them eligible for federal aid.\n\n# See Also\n\n* List of tornado outbreaks\n* List of tornadoes in the United States\n* Tornadoes of 2022\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a factual account of the tornado outbreak sequence of April 4–7, 2022.

{"title": "Malahai", "content": "#Etymology\n#Design and materials\n#In Russia\n#See also\n#Explanatory notes\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Malahai\n\nThe malahai is a traditional type of footwear originating from the Eastern European region, specifically from Russia and Ukraine. It is a type of soft, low-heeled shoe made from leather or other pliable materials, typically worn for casual or everyday purposes. In this article, we will delve into the etymology, design, and materials used in malahai, as well as its significance and usage in Russia.\n\n#Etymology\n\nThe word \"malahai\" is derived from the Russian language, where it is written as \"малахай\" (malakhay). The term is believed to have originated from the Ukrainian language, where a similar type of footwear is known as \"малахай\" (malakhay) or \"махай\" (makhay). The etymology of the word is unclear, but it is thought to be related to the Turkish word \"mahai,\" which refers to a type of soft shoe.\n\n##Evolution of the term\n\nOver time, the term \"malahai\" has undergone changes in meaning and usage. In the 19th century, it referred specifically to a type of soft, heelless shoe worn by peasants and laborers. In modern times, the term has expanded to include a wider range of footwear styles, including low-heeled shoes and sandals.\n\n#Design and materials\n\nMalahai are characterized by their soft, pliable design and low heel. They are typically made from leather, suede, or other materials that are supple and flexible. The shoes may feature a variety of designs, including intricate stitching, embroidery, or other forms of ornamentation.\n\n##Types of malahai\n\nThere are several types of malahai, each with its own unique design and features. Some common types include:\n\n* **Classic malahai**: This is the most traditional type of malahai, characterized by a simple, low-heeled design and a soft, leather upper.\n* **Decorative malahai**: This type of malahai features intricate stitching, embroidery, or other forms of ornamentation.\n* **Malahai boots**: This type of malahai extends above the ankle, providing additional warmth and support.\n* **Malahai sandals**: This type of malahai features a strap or straps that secure the foot, rather than a full upper.\n\n##Materials used\n\nMalahai are typically made from leather, suede, or other materials that are soft and pliable. The choice of material will depend on the desired appearance, durability, and comfort of the shoe.\n\n* **Leather**: This is the most traditional material used for malahai, and is prized for its durability and suppleness.\n* **Suede**: This material is softer and more delicate than leather, and is often used for decorative malahai.\n* **Synthetic materials**: These materials are often used for more affordable malahai, and may be less durable than leather or suede.\n\n#In Russia\n\nMalahai have a long history in Russia, where they have been worn for centuries as a type of casual, everyday footwear.\n\n##History of malahai in Russia\n\nMalahai were first introduced to Russia in the 16th century, when they were brought back from Ukraine and other Eastern European regions by merchants and travelers. They quickly became popular among peasants and laborers, who prized their comfort and durability.\n\n##Significance of malahai in Russian culture\n\nMalahai have played an important role in Russian culture, particularly in traditional folk dress. They are often worn as part of a traditional outfit, along with a long shirt and trousers.\n\n##Modern usage of malahai in Russia\n\nToday, malahai are still worn in Russia, although they are less common than they once were. They are often worn as a type of casual, everyday footwear, and are prized for their comfort and durability.\n\n#See also\n\n* **Valenki**: A type of traditional Russian footwear that is similar to malahai.\n* **Lapti**: A type of traditional Russian footwear that is made from woven strips of leather or cloth.\n* **Kalinka**: A type of traditional Russian footwear that is made from leather or suede and features a decorative strap or buckle.\n\n#Explanatory notes\n\nThis article has provided an overview of the malahai, a traditional type of footwear originating from Eastern Europe.
