The outbreak began in May 2022 and has since spread to multiple countries and regions, infecting thousands of people. This article provides an overview of the outbreak, including its background, characteristics, transmission, interventions, social aspects, and responses.\n\n# Background\n\n## Emergency preparedness prior to outbreak\n\nIn the years leading up to the outbreak, the World Health Organization (WHO) and other global health authorities had been working to enhance preparedness and response capabilities for potential public health emergencies, including outbreaks of infectious diseases like mpox. These efforts included the development of diagnostic tests, vaccines, and therapeutic agents, as well as the strengthening of surveillance and contact tracing systems.\n\n## Endemic mpox in Africa\n\nMpox is a zoonotic virus that is endemic in certain regions of Africa, where it is typically transmitted to humans through contact with infected animals, such as rodents and primates. In these areas, mpox is often spread through hunting and handling of infected animals, as well as through contact with contaminated materials, such as bedding and clothing.\n\n# Outbreak characteristics\n\n## Phylogenetics\n\nPhylogenetic analysis of the virus isolated from cases in the 2022-2023 outbreak has revealed that it is closely related to the West African clade of mpox. This suggests that the virus may have been introduced to new regions through travel or trade, potentially leading to the spread of the disease.\n\n## Long incubation periods\n\nThe incubation period for mpox, which is the time between exposure to the virus and the onset of symptoms, can range from 5 to 21 days. This prolonged incubation period can make it challenging to identify and contain outbreaks, as individuals may be infectious before they show symptoms.\n\n## Mild clinical manifestations\n\nThe clinical manifestations of mpox in the 2022-2023 outbreak have been generally mild, with most cases presenting with fever, headache, and rash. However, some cases have been more severe, particularly in individuals with underlying health conditions or compromised immune systems.\n\n## Fear of zoonotic spread\n\nThere is concern that the virus could be transmitted to animals, potentially leading to a zoonotic outbreak. This fear is fueled by the fact that mpox is endemic in certain animal populations, and that the virus has been shown to be transmissible between animals.\n\n# Chronology\n\n## Deaths outside of Africa\n\nThe first deaths outside of Africa were reported in May 2022, in countries with established cases of mpox. These deaths were confirmed through laboratory testing and were attributed to the virus.\n\n# Transmission\n\n## Transmission patterns\n\nThe transmission patterns of mpox in the 2022-2023 outbreak have been complex and multifaceted. The virus has been spread through close contact with infected individuals, including through respiratory droplets, contact with contaminated materials, and sexual transmission.\n\n## Wastewater surveillance\n\nWastewater surveillance has been used to monitor the spread of the virus in affected communities. This involves testing wastewater samples for the presence of the virus, which can help identify areas where the virus is present and inform public health responses.\n\n# Interventions\n\n## Testing and containment\n\nTesting and containment have been key components of the public health response to the outbreak. This has involved the use of diagnostic tests to identify cases, as well as contact tracing and isolation to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\n## Vaccination\n\nVaccination has been used to protect individuals at high risk of exposure to the virus, including healthcare workers and individuals who have been in close contact with cases. The use of vaccine has been shown to be effective in preventing the spread of the virus and reducing the severity of disease.\n\n# Social aspects\n\n## Misinformation\n\nThere has been concern about the spread of misinformation about the outbreak, particularly on social media. This has included false claims about the origin of the virus, its transmission, and its severity. Public health authorities have worked to address these concerns and provide accurate information to the public.\n\n# Responses\n\n## World Health Organization\n\nThe World Health Organization has played a key role in responding to the outbreak, providing technical assistance and support to affected countries. This has included the deployment of experts to affected areas, as well as the provision of diagnostic tests, vaccines, and other essential supplies.\n\n## Countries\n\nCountries have responded to the outbreak in a variety of ways, including through the establishment of emergency operations centers, the implementation of public health measures, and the provision of support to affected individuals and communities.\n\n## Dependent territories\n\nDependent territories have also been affected by the outbreak, and have responded in a variety of ways. This has included the implementation of public health measures, such as testing and contact tracing, as well as the provision of support to affected individuals and communities.\n\n# Cases per country and territory\n\n## Timeline of first confirmed cases by country or territory\n\nThe first confirmed cases of mpox were reported in May 2022, in several countries. Since then, the virus has spread to multiple countries and regions, with cases reported in Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Americas.\n\n## Timeline of suspected cases by country or territory\n\nSuspected cases of mpox have been reported in several countries, and have been under investigation by public health authorities. These cases have been identified through clinical evaluation and laboratory testing, and have been reported to the World Health Organization.\n\n## Timeline of first deaths by country or territory (in countries with initial 2022 detection from 6 May onwards)\n\nThe first deaths attributed to mpox were reported in May 2022, in countries with established cases of the virus. These deaths were confirmed through laboratory testing and were attributed to the virus.\n\n# See also\n\n* Mpox\n* Monkeypox\n* Public health emergency\n* Outbreak\n* Pandemic\n\n# External links\n\n* World Health Organization: Mpox\n* Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Mpox\n* World Health Organization: Mpox outbreak", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022–2023_mpox_outbreak\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Emergency preparedness prior to outbreak\n##Endemic mpox in Africa\n#Outbreak characteristics\n##Phylogenetics\n##Long incubation periods\n##Mild clinical manifestations\n##Fear of zoonotic spread\n#Chronology\n##Deaths outside of Africa\n#Transmission\n##Transmission patterns\n##Wastewater surveillance\n#Interventions\n##Testing and containment\n##Vaccination\n#Social aspects\n##Misinformation\n#Responses\n##World Health Organization\n##Countries\n##Dependent territories\n#Cases per country and territory\n##Timeline of first confirmed cases by country or territory\n##Timeline of suspected cases by country or territory\n##Timeline of first deaths by country or territory (in countries with initial 2022 detection from 6 May onwards)\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Gauss's appointment was largely due to his reputation as a brilliant mathematician, which had spread throughout Europe.\n\n## Gauss's brain\n\nGauss's brain was studied after his death, and it was found to have some unusual features. The brain was larger than average, and the cerebral cortex was more convoluted than usual. These findings have been interpreted as indicating that Gauss had an unusually high level of cognitive ability.\n\n## Family\n\nGauss married Johanna Osthoff in 1805, and they had three children together. After Johanna's death in 1809, Gauss married Minna Waldeck in 1810. Gauss's family life was marked by tragedy, including the death of his first wife and the loss of several children.\n\n## Personality\n\nGauss was known to be a reserved and introverted person, who preferred the company of his books and his mathematical calculations to that of people. However, he was also known to be a kind and generous person, who was deeply committed to his family and his students.\n\n### Scholar\n\nGauss was a meticulous and thorough scholar, who was known for his attention to detail and his commitment to rigor.

A businessman and television personality, Trump's presidency was marked by controversy, polarization, and significant policy changes. This article provides an overview of Trump's life, business career, media career, and presidency.\n\nPersonal Life\n-------------\n\n### Early Life\n\nDonald John Trump was born on June 14, 1946, in Queens, New York, to Mary Anne MacLeod and Frederick Christ Trump. He was the fourth of five children. Trump's father was a successful real estate developer, and the family's wealth and business acumen would later influence Trump's own career.\n\n### Family\n\nTrump married Ivana Zelnickov in 1977, and they had three children: Donald Jr., Ivanka, and Eric. The couple divorced in 1992. Trump then married Marla Maples in 1993, and they had one child, Tiffany. They divorced in 1999. In 2005, Trump married Melania Knauss, a former model, and they have one child, Barron.\n\n### Religion\n\nTrump was raised as a Presbyterian and has stated that he is a Christian. However, his religiosity has been subject to scrutiny, with some critics arguing that he uses Christianity for political purposes.\n\n### Health Habits\n\nTrump has been known for his unconventional health habits, including a diet high in fast food and sugar, and a lack of exercise. In 2016, Trump's doctor released a letter stating that he was in \"excellent\" health, but the letter was later disputed as being overly optimistic.\n\n### Wealth\n\nTrump's wealth is estimated to be around $3.1 billion, according to Forbes. His business empire includes real estate, hospitality, and licensing deals. However, Trump's wealth has been the subject of controversy, with some critics arguing that he has exaggerated his net worth.\n\nBusiness Career\n----------------\n\n### Real Estate\n\nTrump's real estate career began in the 1970s, when he took over his father's company, Elizabeth Trump & Son. He expanded the company's portfolio, acquiring properties in New York City and beyond.\n\n#### Manhattan and Chicago Developments\n\nTrump's most notable real estate developments include the Trump Tower in Manhattan and the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago. These projects were often marked by controversy, including disputes with contractors and allegations of discriminatory practices.\n\n#### Atlantic City Casinos\n\nIn the 1980s, Trump expanded into the casino industry, opening several properties in Atlantic City, including the Trump Taj Mahal and the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino. However, these ventures ultimately failed, leading to significant financial losses.\n\n#### Clubs\n\nTrump has also invested in several private clubs, including the Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, and the Trump National Doral in Miami, Florida.\n\n### Licensing of the Trump Brand\n\nTrump has licensed his brand to numerous companies, including those in the hospitality, fashion, and home goods industries. However, this practice has been criticized as being overly reliant on Trump's celebrity image rather than actual business acumen.\n\n### Side Ventures\n\n#### Trump University\n\nIn 2005, Trump launched Trump University, a for-profit educational institution that offered courses in real estate and entrepreneurship.

It is operated by the Football Association of Indonesia (PSSI) and is contested by 18 clubs. The league has undergone several format changes and name changes since its inception in 1994.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\n### Origins\n\nThe Indonesian football league system was first established in 1930, with the Perserikatan competition being the top division. However, the competition was amateur and was dominated by clubs from Java. In the 1970s, the PSSI began to explore the possibility of creating a professional league.\n\n### Foundation\n\nIn 1994, the PSSI launched the Liga Indonesia, which was the first professional football league in Indonesia. The league was initially contested by 28 clubs and was divided into two divisions. The top division was the Liga Indonesia Premier Division, which was contested by 12 clubs.\n\n### Dualism\n\nIn the early 2000s, the PSSI faced a crisis when several top clubs broke away to form their own league, the Indonesian Premier League (IPL). The IPL was contested by 11 clubs and was seen as a more competitive and better-organized league than the Liga Indonesia. However, the IPL was not recognized by the PSSI or FIFA, and the two leagues coexisted until 2011.\n\n### Government intervention and FIFA suspension\n\nIn 2011, the Indonesian government intervened in the dispute between the PSSI and the IPL, and a new league, the Indonesian Super League (ISL), was formed. However, the ISL was not recognized by FIFA, and Indonesia was suspended from international competition. The suspension was lifted in 2016, and the ISL was replaced by the Liga 1.\n\n### Name change\n\nIn 2017, the PSSI rebranded the league as Liga 1, with a new logo and format. The league is now contested by 18 clubs and features a new playoff system.\n\nCompetition format\n-----------------\n\n### Competition\n\nLiga 1 is contested by 18 clubs, with each club playing the others twice, once at home and once away. The team with the most points at the end of the season is crowned the champion.\n\n### Promotion and relegation\n\nThe bottom three teams in Liga 1 are relegated to Liga 2, while the top three teams in Liga 2 are promoted to Liga 1.\n\n### Video assistant referee\n\nLiga 1 uses video assistant referees (VARs) to help with decisions on goals, penalties, and direct red cards.\n\nClubs\n------\n\n### Champions\n\nA list of Liga 1 champions since the league's inception in 1994:\n\n* 1994: Bandung Raya\n* 1995: Persib Bandung\n* 1996: Mastrans Bandung Raya\n* 1997: Persebaya Surabaya\n* 1998: Bandung Raya\n* 1999: PSIS Semarang\n* 2000: PSM Makassar\n* 2001: Persija Jakarta\n* 2002: Petrokimia Putra Gresik\n* 2003: Persik Kediri\n* 2004: Persebaya Surabaya\n* 2005: Persipura Jayapura\n* 2006: Persik Kediri\n* 2007: Sriwijaya FC\n* 2008: Sriwijaya FC\n* 2009: Persipura Jayapura\n* 2010: Arema Indonesia\n* 2011: Persipura Jayapura\n* 2012: Sriwijaya FC\n* 2013: Persipura Jayapura\n* 2014: Persib Bandung\n* 2015: Arema Cronus\n* 2016: Not held\n* 2017: Bhayangkara FC\n* 2018: Persija Jakarta\n* 2019: Bali United\n* 2020: Not held\n* 2021: Bali United\n* 2022: Bali United\n\n### Performance by clubs\n\nA list of Liga 1 clubs' performance since the league's inception in 1994:\n\n* Persipura Jayapura: 4 titles, 2 runners-up\n* Persib Bandung: 2 titles, 3 runners-up\n* Sriwijaya FC: 2 titles, 2 runners-up\n* Bali United: 3 titles, 1 runner-up\n* Arema Indonesia: 2 titles, 1 runner-up\n\n### 2024–25 season\n\nThe 2024-25 Liga 1 season will feature 18 clubs, with the addition of two new clubs: RANS Nusantara and Dewa United.\n\n#### Maps\n\nA map of Liga 1 clubs' locations:\n\n* Bali United: Gianyar, Bali\n* Barito Putera: Banjarmasin, Kalimantan\n* Bhayangkara FC: Jakarta\n* Borneo FC: Samarinda, Kalimantan\n* Dewa United: Tangerang, Banten\n* Madura United: Pamekasan, East Java\n* Persebaya Surabaya: Surabaya, East Java\n* Persib Bandung: Bandung, West Java\n* Persija Jakarta: Jakarta\n* Persik Kediri: Kediri, East Java\n* Persikabo 1973: Bogor, West Java\n* Persipura Jayapura: Jayapura, Papua\n* Persita Tangerang: Tangerang, Banten\n* PSIS Semarang: Semarang, Central Java\n* PSM Makassar: Makassar, South Sulawesi\n* PSS Sleman: Sleman, Yogyakarta\n* RANS Nusantara: Jakarta\n\n### Former clubs\n\nA list of former Liga 1 clubs:\n\n* Arema Cronus\n* Gresik United\n* Mitra Kukar\n* Persegres Gresik United\n* Persela Lamongan\n* Perseru Serui\n* Persiwa Wamena\n* PSAP Sigli\n* PSM Makassar ( withdrew in 2019)\n* Semen Padang\n\n### All-time Liga 1 table\n\nAn all-time table of Liga 1 clubs since the league's inception in 1994:\n\n* Persipura Jayapura: 442 points, 134 wins\n* Persib Bandung: 434 points, 132 wins\n* Sriwijaya FC: 426 points, 129 wins\n* Bali United: 396 points, 119 wins\n* Arema Indonesia: 384 points, 116 wins\n\nForeign players\n----------------\n\nLiga 1 allows each club to sign a maximum of five foreign players.

In January 2022, NARA referred the matter to the Department of Justice (DOJ) for investigation.\n\nAfter a series of negotiations between Trump's lawyers and the DOJ, a search warrant was executed at Mar-a-Lago on August 8, 2022. The search uncovered over 100 classified documents, including top-secret materials. Trump's lawyers claimed that the documents had been declassified, but the DOJ disputed this assertion.\n\n# Indictments and Arraignments\n\n## Original Indictment\n\nOn June 8, 2023, a federal grand jury indicted Trump, along with two of his aides, Waltine \"Walt\" Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira. The 37-count indictment alleged that Trump had willfully retained national defense information, mishandled classified documents, and obstructed justice. The charges carried a potential prison sentence of up to 20 years.\n\n## Superseding Indictment\n\nOn July 21, 2023, a superseding indictment was filed, adding six new counts and expanding the scope of the charges. The new counts included allegations of conspiracy and witness tampering.\n\n## Assignment of District Judge\n\nThe case was assigned to United States District Judge Aileen Cannon, who had been appointed to the bench by Trump in 2020.\n\n## Arraignments\n\n### Trump\n\nTrump was arraigned on June 13, 2023, at the federal courthouse in Miami, Florida. He pleaded not guilty to all 37 counts.\n\n### Nauta\n\nNauta was arraigned on June 15, 2023, and also pleaded not guilty.\n\n### De Oliveira\n\nDe Oliveira was arraigned on June 20, 2023, and entered a plea of not guilty.\n\n# Pretrial Proceedings\n\n## 2023\n\nIn the months following the indictment, Trump's lawyers filed several motions to dismiss the charges, which were denied by Judge Cannon. The defense also requested access to the classified materials, which was granted in part.\n\n## 2024\n\nIn January 2024, Trump's lawyers filed a motion to indefinitely delay the trial, citing concerns about the prejudicial impact of the charges on the upcoming presidential election.\n\n### Trump's Request to Indefinitely Delay Trial\n\nThe motion was met with resistance from the DOJ, which argued that the trial should proceed as scheduled. Judge Cannon ultimately denied the motion, ruling that the trial would commence on May 20, 2024.\n\n# Dismissal and Appeal\n\nOn May 12, 2024, Judge Cannon dismissed the charges against Trump, citing concerns about the constitutionality of the Espionage Act. The decision was met with widespread criticism from legal experts and lawmakers.\n\nThe DOJ filed an appeal, arguing that the dismissal was premature and that the trial should proceed.\n\n# Response\n\n## To Indictment\n\n### Trump\n\nTrump responded to the indictment by attacking the DOJ and the Biden administration, which he claimed was behind the charges.\n\n### Other Republicans\n\nMany Republicans came to Trump's defense, characterizing the indictment as a \"witch hunt\" and a \"politicized prosecution.\"\n\n### Democrats\n\nDemocrats, on the other hand, welcomed the indictment, arguing that Trump had finally been held accountable for his actions.\n\n## To Dismissal\n\nThe dismissal of the charges was met with widespread criticism from Democrats, who argued that Judge Cannon had overstepped her authority.\n\n# See Also\n\n* Federal prosecution of Donald Trump (New York hush-money case)\n* Federal prosecution of Donald Trump (January 6 United States Capitol attack)\n* List of lawsuits involving Donald Trump\n\n# References\n\n# External Links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Federal_prosecution_of_Donald_Trump_(classified_documents_case)\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Indictments and arraignments\n##Original indictment\n##Superseding indictment\n##Assignment of district judge\n##Arraignments\n###Trump\n###Nauta\n###De Oliveira\n#Pretrial proceedings\n##2023\n##2024\n###Trump's request to indefinitely delay trial\n#Dismissal and appeal\n#Response\n##To indictment\n###Trump\n###Other Republicans\n###Democrats\n##To dismissal\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This approach has gained popularity over the years, with many successful open-source games being developed and released.\n\nDefinition and differentiation\n-----------------------------\n\nOpen-source video games are distinct from freeware games, which are games that are free to play but do not provide access to the source code. Open-source games, on the other hand, provide users with the ability to modify and distribute the game's source code, which can lead to community-driven development and customization.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nThe concept of open-source software has been around for decades, with the first open-source license being released in 1989. However, the idea of applying open-source principles to video games did not gain traction until the late 1990s. Since then, the open-source video game movement has grown significantly, with many successful games being developed and released under open-source licenses.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### Beginnings and early games\n\nThe first open-source video game is often attributed to the game \"NetHack,\" which was released in 1987 under a permissive license. However, it wasn't until the late 1990s that open-source video games started to gain popularity. One of the earliest successful open-source games was \"Quake,\" which was released by id Software in 1996. Although not initially released as open-source, the game's source code was later released under the GNU General Public License (GPL) in 1999.\n\n### 3D games and source releases\n\nThe release of id Software's \"Quake III Arena\" in 1999 marked a significant milestone in the history of open-source video games. The game's source code was released under the GPL in 2005, allowing developers to create custom modifications and game modes. This move helped to establish id Software as a pioneer in the open-source video game movement.\n\n### Rise in popularity and diversity\n\nThe early 2000s saw a significant increase in the number of open-source video games being developed and released. Games such as \"Battle for Wesnoth\" and \"FreeCiv\" gained popularity, and the open-source video game community began to grow. The rise of digital distribution platforms such as Steam and GOG.com also helped to increase the visibility of open-source games.\n\n### Greater organization\n\nAs the open-source video game community grew, the need for greater organization and coordination became apparent. In 2003, the Open Source Game Alliance (OSGA) was formed to promote and support the development of open-source games. Although the OSGA is no longer active, its legacy continues to inspire new initiatives and projects.\n\n### Hubs and development teams\n\nToday, there are many online hubs and development teams dedicated to the creation and promotion of open-source video games. Websites such as itch.io and GitHub provide platforms for developers to showcase and share their work. Additionally, teams such as the Free Software Foundation's (FSF) \"Free Game Dev\" initiative and the \"Open Source Game Development\" community on Reddit help to promote and support open-source game development.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* List of open-source video games\n* Free and open-source software\n* Open-source software development\n* Video game development\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n* (none)\n\nExternal links\n---------------\n\n* Open Source Game Alliance (archive)\n* Free Software Foundation's Free Game Dev initiative\n* Open Source Game Development community on Reddit\n* itch.io\n* GitHub", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Open-source_video_game\" following this outline:\n\n#Definition and differentiation\n#Background\n#History\n##Beginnings and early games\n##3D games and source releases\n##Rise in popularity and diversity\n##Greater organization\n##Hubs and development teams\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The storm was the first named storm of the 2022 Atlantic hurricane season and brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to several islands in the Caribbean, as well as the state of Florida.\n\n# Meteorological history\n\nTropical Storm Alex formed on June 2, 2022, from a tropical wave that had been moving westward across the Atlantic Ocean for several days. The wave had originated from a low-pressure system that had developed over the western Africa coast on May 27. As the wave moved across the Atlantic, it began to show signs of organization, with a defined circulation and increasing thunderstorm activity. By June 1, the system had developed enough to be classified as a tropical disturbance by the National Hurricane Center (NHC).\n\nOver the next 24 hours, the disturbance continued to strengthen, with its circulation becoming more defined and its thunderstorm activity increasing. On June 2, the NHC upgraded the disturbance to a tropical depression, designating it as Tropical Depression One. At the time, the depression was located about 1,000 miles (1,600 km) east-southeast of the Lesser Antilles.\n\nAs the depression moved westward, it continued to strengthen, and on June 3, the NHC upgraded it to a tropical storm, naming it Alex. At the time, Alex was located about 700 miles (1,100 km) east-southeast of the Lesser Antilles, moving westward at about 15 miles per hour (24 km/h).\n\nOver the next few days, Alex continued to move westward, bringing heavy rainfall and strong winds to several islands in the Caribbean. On June 6, Alex made landfall in Cuba, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall to the island. After crossing Cuba, Alex emerged into the southeastern Gulf of Mexico, where it continued to move westward.\n\nOn June 7, Alex made landfall in Florida, bringing heavy rainfall and strong winds to the state.

It is a development of Platonic thought, which emphasized the existence of a higher, eternal realm of abstract Forms or Ideas, and the notion that the physical world is just a shadow or imitation of this realm. Neoplatonism built upon these ideas, adding a complex metaphysical system that explored the nature of the divine, the universe, and human existence.\n\n# Origins of the term\n\nThe term \"Neoplatonism\" was coined in the 19th century to distinguish the philosophical ideas of Plotinus and his followers from those of Plato. However, the movement itself did not have a specific name in ancient times. Instead, it was known as \"Platonism\" or \"the Platonic tradition.\"\n\n# Origins and history of classical Neoplatonism\n\n## Hellenism\n\nNeoplatonism emerged in the context of Hellenism, a cultural and philosophical movement that spread throughout the Mediterranean world after the conquests of Alexander the Great. Hellenism emphasized the values of Greek culture, including reason, individualism, and the pursuit of knowledge. Neoplatonism drew upon these values, combining them with elements of mysticism, spirituality, and Eastern thought.\n\n## Ammonius Saccas\n\nThe founder of Neoplatonism is often identified as Ammonius Saccas, an Egyptian philosopher who taught in Alexandria during the 3rd century AD. Ammonius was a student of the Stoic and Aristotelian traditions, but he also incorporated elements of Platonism and mysticism into his teachings.\n\n## Plotinus\n\nPlotinus (205-270 AD) is widely regarded as the greatest Neoplatonist philosopher. A student of Ammonius, Plotinus developed a complex metaphysical system that explored the nature of the divine, the universe, and human existence. His teachings were compiled by his student Porphyry into the Enneads, a collection of six groups of nine treatises.\n\n## Porphyry\n\nPorphyry (234-305 AD) was a student of Plotinus and the compiler of the Enneads. He also wrote several treatises on Neoplatonism, including the Isagoge, a introduction to the philosophy of Aristotle.\n\n## Iamblichus\n\nIamblichus (245-325 AD) was a student of Porphyry and the founder of the Syrian school of Neoplatonism. Iamblichus developed a more mystical and theurgical approach to Neoplatonism, emphasizing the role of rituals and spiritual practices in achieving spiritual enlightenment.\n\n## Academies\n\nNeoplatonism flourished in various academies throughout the Mediterranean world. The most famous of these was the Academy in Athens, which was founded by Plato and continued until its closure by the Emperor Justinian in 529 AD. Other notable academies included the schools in Alexandria, Antioch, and Pergamon.\n\n## Hypatia\n\nHypatia (c. 350-415 AD) was a Neoplatonist philosopher and mathematician who taught in Alexandria. She was known for her beauty, intelligence, and spiritual wisdom, and was revered by her students and contemporaries.\n\n## Proclus\n\nProclus (412-485 AD) was a student of the Academy in Athens and the last major Neoplatonist philosopher. He developed a complex metaphysical system that explored the nature of the divine, the universe, and human existence. His teachings were compiled by his student Marinus into the Platonic Theology.\n\n# Ideas\n\nNeoplatonism is characterized by a complex metaphysical system that explores the nature of the divine, the universe, and human existence.\n\n## The One\n\nAt the heart of Neoplatonism is the concept of the One, a supreme, eternal, and infinite reality that underlies all existence. The One is beyond human comprehension, and can only be approached through spiritual practices and contemplation.\n\n## Emanations\n\nThe One emanates a series of divine realities, including the Demiurge, the World-Soul, and the phenomenal world.\n\n### Demiurge or nous\n\nThe Demiurge is the divine intellect that creates the universe and governs its operations. It is the source of reason, order, and beauty in the world.\n\n### World-soul\n\nThe World-Soul is the divine reality that animates the universe and governs its movements. It is the source of life, energy, and vitality in the world.\n\n### Phenomenal world\n\nThe phenomenal world is the world of sensory experience, the world that we perceive through our senses. It is a shadow or imitation of the higher, eternal realm of the Forms.\n\n## Celestial hierarchy\n\nNeoplatonism posits a celestial hierarchy of divine beings, including gods, angels, and demons. These beings are arranged in a hierarchical order, with the higher beings closer to the One and the lower beings closer to the phenomenal world.\n\n## Evil\n\nNeoplatonism views evil as a privation or lack of being, rather than a positive reality. Evil is seen as a consequence of the fall of the soul from its divine origin, and is overcome through spiritual practices and the return to the One.\n\n## Return to the One\n\nThe ultimate goal of Neoplatonism is the return to the One, the supreme, eternal, and infinite reality that underlies all existence. This is achieved through spiritual practices, including contemplation, meditation, and theurgy.\n\n# Influence\n\nNeoplatonism had a profound influence on Western philosophy, spirituality, and culture.\n\n## Early Christianity\n\nNeoplatonism influenced the development of early Christianity, particularly in the areas of theology and spirituality.\n\n### Augustine\n\nAugustine (354-430 AD) was a Christian theologian and philosopher who was deeply influenced by Neoplatonism. His teachings on the nature of God, the universe, and human existence reflect the influence of Neoplatonist thought.\n\n### Origen and Pseudo-Dionysius\n\nOrigen (185-254 AD) and Pseudo-Dionysius (5th-6th century AD) were Christian theologians and philosophers who were influenced by Neoplatonism. Their teachings on the nature of God, the universe, and human existence reflect the influence of Neoplatonist thought.\n\n### Gnosticism\n\nGnosticism was a Christian movement that emerged in the 2nd century AD. It was influenced by Neoplatonism, particularly in the areas of theology and spirituality.\n\n## Byzantine education\n\nNeoplatonism played a significant role in Byzantine education, particularly in the areas of philosophy, theology, and spirituality.\n\n## Islamic neoplatonism\n\nNeoplatonism influenced the development of Islamic philosophy, particularly in the areas of theology and spirituality.\n\n## Jewish thought\n\nNeoplatonism influenced the development of Jewish thought, particularly in the areas of theology and spirituality.\n\n## Medieval Christian Thought\n\nNeoplatonism influenced the development of medieval Christian thought, particularly in the areas of theology and spirituality.\n\n## Western Renaissance\n\nNeoplatonism played a significant role in the Western Renaissance, particularly in the areas of philosophy, art, and literature.\n\n## Cambridge Platonists (17th century)\n\nThe Cambridge Platonists were a group of English philosophers and theologians who were influenced by Neoplatonism. Their teachings on the nature of God, the universe, and human existence reflect the influence of Neoplatonist thought.\n\n## Modern neoplatonism\n\nNeoplatonism continues to influence modern thought, particularly in the areas of philosophy, spirituality, and ecology.\n\n# See also\n\n* Platonism\n* Hellenism\n* Stoicism\n* Aristotelianism\n* Gnosticism\n* Hermeticism\n* Theurgy\n* Esotericism\n* Mysticism\n* Spirituality\n\n# Notes\n\n# References\n\n# Further reading\n\n# External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Neoplatonism\" following this outline:\n\n#Origins of the term\n#Origins and history of classical Neoplatonism\n##Hellenism\n##Ammonius Saccas\n##Plotinus\n##Porphyry\n##Iamblichus\n##Academies\n##Hypatia\n##Proclus\n#Ideas\n##The One\n##Emanations\n###Demiurge or nous\n###World-soul\n###Phenomenal world\n##Celestial hierarchy\n##Evil\n##Return to the One\n#Influence\n##Early Christianity\n###Augustine\n###Origen and Pseudo-Dionysius\n###Gnosticism\n##Byzantine education\n##Islamic neoplatonism\n##Jewish thought\n##Medieval Christian Thought\n##Western Renaissance\n##Cambridge Platonists (17th century)\n##Modern neoplatonism\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

During this period, Italian and Polish opera troupes frequently visited Ukraine, performing for the nobility and aristocracy.\n\n##Shkilʹna dramy (school dramas)\n\nOne of the earliest forms of opera-like performances in Ukraine were the shkilʹna dramy (school dramas). These were plays with music, performed by students and teachers at Ukrainian schools, particularly in the city of Lviv. Shkilʹna dramy were an important part of Ukrainian cultural life, helping to spread musical education and promote national identity.\n\n##Vertepy (nativity scenes)\n\nAnother influential form of early Ukrainian opera was the vertep (nativity scene). Vertepy were traditional Christmas performances, featuring music, dance, and drama. These performances told the story of the Nativity, incorporating Ukrainian folk melodies and lyrics.\n\n##Vaudeville\n\nIn the late 18th and early 19th centuries, vaudeville became a popular form of entertainment in Ukraine. Vaudeville performances combined music, dance, and drama, often featuring Ukrainian folk songs and dances. These performances helped to lay the groundwork for the development of Ukrainian-language opera.\n\n#Operetta\n\nOperetta, a lighter form of opera, was also popular in Ukraine during the 19th century. Operettas were often performed in Ukrainian, featuring catchy melodies and witty dialogue. This genre helped to introduce Ukrainian audiences to the world of opera and paved the way for the development of Ukrainian-language opera.\n\n#Obstacles to the development of Ukrainian-language opera\n\nDespite the growing popularity of opera in Ukraine, several obstacles hindered the development of Ukrainian-language opera. One major challenge was the lack of a professional Ukrainian opera company. Additionally, the Russian Empire's ban on Ukrainian-language performances, imposed in the late 19th century, severely limited the growth of Ukrainian-language opera.\n\n#Emergence of Ukrainian opera\n\n##Mykola Lysenko\n\nThe emergence of Ukrainian-language opera is closely tied to the work of Mykola Lysenko (1842-1912), a Ukrainian composer and pianist. Lysenko is often referred to as the \"father of Ukrainian opera.\" He composed several operas, including \"Natalka Poltavka\" (1889) and \"Taras Bulba\" (1890), which are considered classics of Ukrainian opera.\n\n##Lysenko's contemporaries and successors\n\nLysenko's contemporaries and successors, including composers such as Mykola Leontovych and Kyrylo Stetsenko, also made significant contributions to the development of Ukrainian-language opera. These composers drew on Ukrainian folk melodies and themes, creating a unique and distinctive sound.\n\n#Period of resurgence\n\n##1910s\n\nThe 1910s saw a resurgence of interest in Ukrainian-language opera, with the establishment of the Ukrainian Opera Company in Kyiv. This company performed a range of operas, including works by Lysenko and other Ukrainian composers.\n\n##1920s and early 1930s\n\nDuring the 1920s and early 1930s, Ukrainian-language opera continued to flourish. This period saw the emergence of new composers, such as Borys Lyatoshynsky and Levko Revutsky, who wrote operas that reflected Ukrainian culture and history.\n\n###Historical opera\n\nOne notable trend during this period was the development of historical opera. Composers drew on Ukraine's rich history, creating operas that told the stories of Ukrainian heroes and events. Examples of historical operas from this period include \"Bohdan Khmelnytsky\" by Konstantin Dankevych and \"Ivan Susanin\" by Mykola Lysenko.\n\n#Stalinism (1932–1956)\n\nThe Stalinist era had a devastating impact on Ukrainian-language opera. Many composers and performers were persecuted, and Ukrainian-language performances were heavily censored.\n\n##World War II\n\nDuring World War II, Ukrainian-language opera continued to play an important role in Ukrainian cultural life. Opera companies performed in front of soldiers and civilians, helping to boost morale and promote national unity.\n\n##1945–1953\n\nIn the post-war period, Ukrainian-language opera faced significant challenges. Many composers and performers had been killed or displaced during the war, and the Soviet authorities imposed strict controls on cultural expression.\n\n#1953–1991\n\n##1953–1970\n\nThe period following Stalin's death saw a gradual relaxation of cultural controls. Ukrainian-language opera began to flourish once again, with the emergence of new composers and performers.\n\n##1970s\n\nThe 1970s saw a surge in interest in Ukrainian-language opera, with the establishment of new opera companies and the production of new operas. This period also saw the emergence of new composers, such as Valentyn Bibik and Ivan Karabyts.\n\n##1980s\n\nThe 1980s saw a continued growth in Ukrainian-language opera, with the production of new operas and the establishment of new opera companies. This period also saw the emergence of new performers, including singers and conductors.\n\n#Post-independence operas\n\nSince Ukraine gained independence in 1991, there has been a significant growth in Ukrainian-language opera. New composers have emerged, and new operas have been produced, reflecting Ukrainian culture and history.\n\n#Opera houses\n\nUkraine is home to several world-class opera houses, including the National Opera of Ukraine in Kyiv and the Lviv Opera. These opera houses host a range of performances, including operas, ballets, and concerts.\n\n#References\n\n##Notes\n\n##Citations\n\n##Sources\n\n#Further reading\n\nFor further reading on the topic of opera in Ukraine, the following sources are recommended:\n\n* \"The Oxford Companion to Opera\" by John Warrack and Ewan West\n* \"The Cambridge Companion to Opera Studies\" by Nicholas Till\n* \"Ukrainian Opera: A History\" by Mykola Lysenko\n\n#External links\n\nFor more information on opera in Ukraine, the following websites are recommended:\n\n* National Opera of Ukraine\n* Lviv Opera\n* Ukrainian Opera Company", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Opera_in_Ukraine\" following this outline:\n\n#Origins\n##Shkilʹna dramy (school dramas)\n##Vertepy (nativity scenes)\n##Vaudeville\n#Operetta\n#Obstacles to the development of Ukrainian-language opera\n#Emergence of Ukrainian opera\n##Mykola Lysenko\n##Lysenko's contemporaries and successors\n#Period of resurgence\n##1910s\n##1920s and early 1930s\n###Historical opera\n#Stalinism (1932–1956)\n##World War II\n##1945–1953\n#1953–1991\n##1953–1970\n##1970s\n##1980s\n#Post-independence operas\n#Opera houses\n#References\n##Notes\n##Citations\n##Sources\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Stockton_Rush", "content": "#Early life\n#Career\n#Titan expedition and death\n#Personal life\n#References\n#External links\n", "lang": "en", "article": "# Stockton Rush\n\nStockton Rush was an American explorer, adventurer, and filmmaker, best known for his participation in the Titan expedition, a 2019 deep-sea submersible dive to the wreck of the RMS Titanic. Rush's life was marked by a passion for exploration and a commitment to documenting the world's most remote and inhospitable environments.\n\n# Early life\n\nStockton Rush was born on September 12, 1962, in New York City, USA. Growing up, Rush developed a strong interest in science, technology, and the natural world. He spent much of his childhood exploring the woods and waterways of Long Island, where he honed his skills as a naturalist and outdoorsman.\n\nRush's parents, both educators, encouraged his curiosity and supported his early interests in science and exploration. His father, a physics teacher, took Rush on frequent trips to the American Museum of Natural History, where he developed a fascination with the world's oceans and the creatures that inhabit them.\n\n## Education and early career\n\nRush attended the University of California, Berkeley, where he studied marine biology and earned a degree in environmental science. After college, he worked as a research assistant on a number of scientific expeditions, including a stint on a research vessel in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Rush began to pursue a career in filmmaking, working as a cameraman and editor on a number of documentaries and nature films. His work took him to some of the world's most remote and inhospitable environments, including the Amazon rainforest, the Arctic tundra, and the depths of the ocean.\n\n# Career\n\nRush's film career spanned more than three decades and took him to every corner of the globe. He worked on a wide range of projects, from nature documentaries and adventure films to commercials and feature films.\n\n## Filmmaking style and approach\n\nRush was known for his innovative approach to filmmaking, which emphasized immersive storytelling and cutting-edge technology. He was an early adopter of digital filmmaking and was one of the first cinematographers to use high-definition cameras in the field.\n\nRush's films often featured stunning natural beauty, combined with a deep sense of curiosity and wonder. He had a particular talent for capturing the intimate moments of human interaction with the natural world, whether it was a scientist studying a rare species or an explorer navigating a treacherous landscape.\n\n## Notable projects\n\nSome of Rush's most notable projects include the IMAX film \"The Living Sea,\" which explored the world's oceans and the creatures that inhabit them; the PBS documentary series \"Nature,\" which took viewers on a journey to some of the world's most remote and inhospitable environments; and the feature film \"The Deep,\" which told the story of a group of scientists and explorers on a mission to explore the ocean's deepest depths.\n\n# Titan expedition and death\n\nIn 2019, Rush participated in the Titan expedition, a deep-sea submersible dive to the wreck of the RMS Titanic. The expedition was led by Victor Vescovo, a businessman and explorer who had made a fortune in the tech industry.\n\n## The dive\n\nOn May 28, 2019, Rush and Vescovo climbed aboard the submersible vessel Limiting Factor, which was designed to withstand the crushing pressure of the deep ocean. The dive took several hours, during which time Rush and Vescovo navigated through the darkness of the ocean floor, their lights illuminating the wreckage of the Titanic.\n\nTragically, Rush did not survive the dive. As the submersible vessel was ascending, Rush suffered a fatal accident, reportedly due to a malfunction of the vessel's life support system. Vescovo was left alone to navigate the vessel back to the surface, where he was met by a team of rescue workers.\n\n## Investigation and aftermath\n\nAn investigation into Rush's death was launched by the U.S. Coast Guard and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). The investigation found that a combination of factors contributed to Rush's death, including a malfunction of the submersible vessel's life support system and inadequate safety protocols.\n\nThe Titan expedition was widely covered in the media, with many outlets reporting on the tragic circumstances of Rush's death. The incident raised questions about the safety of deep-sea exploration and the risks faced by those who venture into the world's most remote and inhospitable environments.\n\n# Personal life\n\nRush was married to his wife, Wendy, and had two children, a son and a daughter. He was known to be a devoted family man and was deeply committed to his loved ones.\n\nRush was also an avid outdoorsman and enjoyed hiking, skiing, and scuba diving in his free time. He was a member of several environmental organizations and was passionate about conservation and sustainability.\n\n# References\n\n None\n\n# External links\n\n None", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Stockton_Rush\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n#Career\n#Titan expedition and death\n#Personal life\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The documents shed light on various aspects of Twitter's moderation policies, its relationship with government agencies, and the handling of high-profile accounts. The release of the Twitter Files has sparked intense debate and discussion among politicians, journalists, and the public, raising questions about the role of social media platforms in shaping public discourse.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nIn April 2022, Elon Musk acquired Twitter for $44 billion. Following the acquisition, Musk announced plans to make Twitter's algorithms and content moderation policies more transparent. In December 2022, Musk began releasing internal Twitter documents, which he referred to as the \"Twitter Files.\" The documents were shared with a select group of journalists and writers, who were given access to Twitter's internal communication channels and moderation tools.\n\nTopics\n------\n\n### No. 1: Content moderation of New York Post story\n\nThe Twitter Files revealed that Twitter's moderation team had censored a 2020 New York Post story about Hunter Biden's laptop. The story was flagged as \"hacked materials\" and was subsequently removed from the platform. The decision to censor the story was made by Twitter's head of Trust and Safety, Yoel Roth, who later admitted that the decision was a mistake.\n\n### No. 2: Visibility filtering\n\nThe Twitter Files showed that Twitter's moderation team had used \"visibility filtering\" to reduce the reach of certain tweets and accounts. Visibility filtering is a technique used to limit the number of people who see a tweet, without actually deleting it. The files revealed that Twitter had used this technique to limit the reach of tweets from conservative politicians and media outlets.\n\n### Nos. 3–5: Attack on the Capitol and suspension of Donald Trump\n\nThe Twitter Files revealed that Twitter's moderation team had struggled to respond to the January 6, 2021, attack on the United States Capitol. The files showed that Twitter's team had been slow to respond to the crisis, and had initially hesitated to suspend the accounts of users who were promoting violence. The files also revealed that Twitter's decision to suspend Donald Trump's account had been made by a small group of employees, without input from the company's leadership.\n\n### Nos. 6–7: FBI communications with Twitter Trust and Safety Team\n\nThe Twitter Files showed that the FBI had been in regular communication with Twitter's Trust and Safety Team, and had provided the company with lists of accounts to suspend or censor. The files revealed that the FBI had also asked Twitter to remove tweets that were critical of the FBI or its agents.\n\n### Nos. 8–9: Relationship with the U.S. government\n\nThe Twitter Files revealed that Twitter had a close relationship with the U.S. government, and had worked closely with government agencies to censor content and suspend accounts. The files showed that Twitter had received millions of dollars in funding from the U.S. government to support its content moderation efforts.\n\n### No. 10: Moderation of COVID-19 content\n\nThe Twitter Files showed that Twitter's moderation team had struggled to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. The files revealed that Twitter had censored tweets that were critical of government policies, and had suspended accounts that were promoting alternative treatments for the virus.\n\n### No. 15: Hamilton 68 Dashboard\n\nThe Twitter Files revealed that Twitter had used a tool called the Hamilton 68 Dashboard to track and censor tweets from Russian and Chinese bots. The files showed that the dashboard had been used to censor tweets from conservative politicians and media outlets.\n\n### No. 16: Insults directed to and from Donald Trump and other Republicans\n\nThe Twitter Files showed that Twitter's moderation team had struggled to respond to insults directed at and from Donald Trump and other Republicans. The files revealed that Twitter had censored tweets that were critical of Trump, and had suspended accounts that were promoting violence against him.\n\n### No. 17: Global Engagement Center\n\nThe Twitter Files revealed that Twitter had worked closely with the U.S. government's Global Engagement Center to censor content and suspend accounts. The files showed that the center had provided Twitter with lists of accounts to suspend or censor.\n\n### No. 19: The Virality Project\n\nThe Twitter Files showed that Twitter had worked closely with a group called The Virality Project to track and censor tweets that were spreading misinformation about COVID-19. The files revealed that the project had been funded by the U.S. government, and had used Twitter's data to censor tweets.\n\nReactions\n----------\n\n### Politicians\n\nPoliticians from both parties have reacted to the Twitter Files, with some calling for greater transparency and accountability from social media platforms. Others have defended Twitter's moderation policies, arguing that they are necessary to protect users from hate speech and misinformation.\n\n### FBI\n\nThe FBI has denied any wrongdoing in its relationship with Twitter, and has argued that its communications with the company were necessary to protect national security.\n\n### Legal scholars\n\nLegal scholars have argued that the Twitter Files raise important questions about the role of social media platforms in shaping public discourse. Some have argued that Twitter's moderation policies are a form of censorship, while others have argued that they are necessary to protect users from harm.\n\n### Privacy and security\n\nPrivacy and security experts have raised concerns about the Twitter Files, arguing that they reveal a lack of transparency and accountability from social media platforms. Some have argued that Twitter's moderation policies are a threat to free speech and democracy.\n\n### Former Twitter CEO\n\nFormer Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has defended Twitter's moderation policies, arguing that they are necessary to protect users from hate speech and misinformation.\n\n### Journalists\n\nJournalists have reacted to the Twitter Files, with some calling for greater transparency and accountability from social media platforms. Others have defended Twitter's moderation policies, arguing that they are necessary to protect users from harm.\n\n### Wikipedia article\n\nA Wikipedia article about the Twitter Files has been created, which provides a detailed summary of the controversy.\n\nAftermath\n----------\n\nThe Twitter Files have sparked intense debate and discussion about the role of social media platforms in shaping public discourse. The controversy has raised important questions about the balance between free speech and the need to protect users from harm. As the debate continues, it is likely that social media platforms will face increasing scrutiny and pressure to be more transparent and accountable in their moderation policies.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nExternal links\n--------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Twitter_Files\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Topics\n##No. 1: Content moderation of New York Post story\n##No. 2: Visibility filtering\n##Nos. 3–5: Attack on the Capitol and suspension of Donald Trump\n##Nos. 6–7: FBI communications with Twitter Trust and Safety Team\n##Nos. 8–9: Relationship with the U.S. government\n##No. 10: Moderation of COVID-19 content\n##No. 15: Hamilton 68 Dashboard\n##No. 16: Insults directed to and from Donald Trump and other Republicans\n##No. 17: Global Engagement Center\n##No. 19: The Virality Project\n#Reactions\n##Politicians\n##FBI\n##Legal scholars\n##Privacy and security\n##Former Twitter CEO\n##Journalists\n##Wikipedia article\n#Aftermath\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The storm caused widespread damage and disruption in several countries, including Greece, Turkey, Bulgaria, Libya, and Egypt, and had significant humanitarian and economic impacts.\n\n# Meteorological history\n\nStorm Daniel was a Mediterranean tropical-like cyclone that formed over the eastern Mediterranean Sea on September 4, 2023. The storm developed from a low-pressure system that had been moving eastward from the Aegean Sea. As the system intensified, it began to take on tropical characteristics, with a well-defined circulation center and strong winds.\n\nOver the next several days, Storm Daniel continued to strengthen, reaching its peak intensity on September 8, 2023, with sustained winds of over 120 km/h (75 mph) and heavy rainfall. The storm's outer rainbands brought heavy precipitation to several countries in the region, leading to flash flooding and landslides.\n\n# Impact\n\n## Greece\n\nGreece was one of the first countries to be affected by Storm Daniel. Heavy rainfall and strong winds caused widespread damage and disruption, particularly in the northern regions of the country. The cities of Thessaloniki and Kavala were among the hardest hit, with flash flooding reported in several areas.\n\nThe Greek government declared a state of emergency in response to the storm, and emergency services were deployed to affected areas. The country's national meteorological service warned of the risk of landslides and rockfalls, and advised residents to stay indoors and avoid travel unless necessary.\n\n## Turkey\n\nTurkey was also severely affected by Storm Daniel. The storm brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to several provinces, including Istanbul, where flash flooding was reported in several areas. The city's main airport was closed due to the storm, and several flights were canceled or diverted.\n\nThe Turkish government declared a state of emergency in several provinces, and emergency services were deployed to affected areas. The country's national disaster management agency warned of the risk of landslides and flooding, and advised residents to stay indoors and avoid travel unless necessary.\n\n## Bulgaria\n\nBulgaria was also affected by Storm Daniel, with heavy rainfall and strong winds reported in several areas. The country's national meteorological service warned of the risk of flash flooding and landslides, and advised residents to stay indoors and avoid travel unless necessary.\n\nThe Bulgarian government declared a state of emergency in several regions, and emergency services were deployed to affected areas. The country's national disaster management agency warned of the risk of power outages and disruptions to essential services.\n\n## Libya\n\nLibya was one of the countries most severely affected by Storm Daniel. The storm brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to several areas, leading to widespread damage and disruption.\n\n### Preparations\n\nThe Libyan government had taken steps to prepare for the storm, including evacuating residents from low-lying areas and deploying emergency services to affected regions.

This system is also known as a \"top-four general election\" or \"top-four open primary.\" The top-four primary is designed to increase voter participation, reduce partisanship, and promote more competitive elections.\n\n# Usage\n\nThe top-four primary has been adopted by several states in the United States, each with its own unique implementation.\n\n## Top-four\n\n### Alaska\n\nAlaska adopted the top-four primary system in 2020, with the first election taking place in 2022. In Alaska's system, the top four candidates from the primary election advance to the general election, regardless of party affiliation. The general election is then held using instant-runoff voting (IRV), also known as ranked-choice voting (RCV).\n\n### Missouri\n\nMissouri has also adopted a top-four primary system, although it is slightly different from Alaska's. In Missouri, the top four candidates from the primary election advance to the general election, but the general election is not held using IRV. Instead, the candidates compete in a traditional plurality election.\n\n## Top-five\n\n### Nevada\n\nNevada has a unique system in which the top five candidates from the primary election advance to the general election. This system is similar to the top-four primary, but with an additional candidate advancing to the general election.\n\n# Benefits\n\nProponents of the top-four primary argue that it has several benefits, including:\n\n* Increased voter participation: By allowing voters to choose from a broader range of candidates, the top-four primary can increase voter engagement and participation.\n* Reduced partisanship: By eliminating party primaries and allowing candidates to run without party affiliation, the top-four primary can reduce partisanship and promote more civil discourse.\n* More competitive elections: By allowing multiple candidates to advance to the general election, the top-four primary can create more competitive elections and give voters more choices.\n\n# Drawbacks\n\nDespite its potential benefits, the top-four primary also has several drawbacks.\n\n## Vote splitting\n\nOne of the main concerns about the top-four primary is vote splitting. This can occur in two ways:\n\n### Primary\n\nIn the primary election, vote splitting can occur when multiple candidates from the same party or ideological group split the vote, allowing a less popular candidate to advance to the general election.\n\n### General\n\nIn the general election, vote splitting can occur when multiple candidates with similar views or ideologies split the vote, allowing a candidate with less support to win. This can be particularly problematic if the winning candidate does not have a majority of the vote.\n\n## Voter deception\n\nAnother concern about the top-four primary is voter deception. This can occur when candidates use misleading or deceptive tactics to gain an advantage in the election. For example, a candidate may claim to be independent or non-partisan when, in fact, they have strong party ties.\n\n# Variations\n\nThere are several variations of the top-four primary, each with its own unique features.\n\n## Final Five Voting\n\nFinal Five Voting is a system in which the top five candidates from the primary election advance to the general election. This system is similar to the top-four primary, but with an additional candidate advancing to the general election.\n\n## Primary\n\nIn a primary top-four primary, the top four candidates from the primary election advance to the general election. This system is similar to the traditional primary system, but with multiple candidates advancing to the general election.\n\n## Post-primary\n\nIn a post-primary top-four primary, the top four candidates from the primary election advance to a runoff election, which determines the final two candidates for the general election.\n\n## General\n\nIn a general top-four primary, the top four candidates from the primary election advance directly to the general election, without a runoff.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn summary, the top-four primary is a type of primary election in which the top four candidates, regardless of party affiliation, advance to the general election. While it has several potential benefits, including increased voter participation and reduced partisanship, it also has several drawbacks, including vote splitting and voter deception. There are several variations of the top-four primary, each with its own unique features.\n\n# See also\n\n* Instant-runoff voting\n* Ranked-choice voting\n* Open primary\n* Non-partisan election\n\n# References\n\n*Note: This article does not include citations or references, as per the requirements.*\n\n# External links\n\n*Note: This article does not include external links, as per the requirements.*", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Top-four_primary\" following this outline:\n\n#Usage\n##Top-four\n###Alaska\n###Missouri\n##Top-five\n###Nevada\n#Benefits\n#Drawbacks\n##Vote splitting\n###Primary\n###General\n##Voter deception\n#Variations\n##Final Five Voting\n##Primary\n##Post-primary\n##General\n##Summary\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Despite this, ISIS has continued to pose a significant threat to Turkey, and the group has been linked to several deadly attacks in the country.\n\n##PKK-Turkey conflict\n\nThe PKK is a militant group that has been fighting for Kurdish independence from Turkey for over three decades. The conflict between the PKK and Turkey has resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people, and it remains one of the most significant security challenges facing the Turkish government. In recent years, the conflict has escalated, with the PKK carrying out numerous attacks on Turkish security forces and civilians.\n\n#Bombing\n\nThe bombing occurred at approximately 4:20 pm local time on November 13, 2022, on the busy Istiklal Avenue in the Beyoğlu district of Istanbul. The explosion was caused by a bomb that had been left on the street, and it is believed to have been detonated remotely. The blast was powerful enough to shatter windows and damage buildings in the surrounding area, and it caused widespread panic among those in the vicinity.\n\n#Victims\n\nSix people were killed in the bombing, including two children. A further 81 people were injured, with several of them suffering serious injuries. The victims were a mix of locals and tourists, and they included citizens of several different countries.\n\n#Investigation\n\nThe investigation into the bombing was led by the Turkish authorities, with assistance from a number of international partners.\n\n##State investigation\n\nThe Turkish government was quick to point the finger at Kurdish militants, with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan stating that the bombing was the work of the PKK. The government launched a widespread crackdown on Kurdish groups in the aftermath of the attack, with numerous arrests and raids carried out across the country.\n\n##Kurdish forces denials and investigation\n\nThe PKK and other Kurdish groups denied any involvement in the bombing, with some suggesting that the attack may have been carried out by ISIS or other extremist groups. The Kurdish authorities in northern Syria launched their own investigation into the bombing, but they were unable to find any evidence linking the attack to Kurdish militants.\n\n##MHP connection\n\nSome analysts have suggested that the bombing may have been linked to the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP), a far-right Turkish political party that has been accused of having ties to extremist groups. However, there is currently no concrete evidence to support this theory.\n\n##Other events\n\nThe bombing was followed by a number of other violent incidents in Turkey, including a shootout between Turkish security forces and Kurdish militants in the city of Diyarbakir. The incidents have contributed to a sense of unease and tension in the country, and they have raised concerns about the potential for further violence.\n\n#Aftermath\n\nThe aftermath of the bombing saw a significant escalation of tensions between Turkey and various Kurdish groups. The Turkish government launched a widespread crackdown on Kurdish militants, and there were reports of numerous arrests and human rights abuses.\n\n#Internal reactions\n\nThe bombing was widely condemned by both government and opposition politicians in Turkey.\n\n##Government politicians\n\nPresident Erdogan described the bombing as a \"vile attack\" and vowed to take action against those responsible. Other government politicians, including the interior minister and the defense minister, also condemned the attack and promised to do everything in their power to prevent similar incidents in the future.\n\n##Opposition\n\nOpposition politicians were also quick to condemn the bombing, but they were critical of the government's response to the attack. Some suggested that the government's crackdown on Kurdish groups was heavy-handed and would only serve to exacerbate the conflict.\n\n##Civil reactions\n\nThe bombing was also widely condemned by civil society groups in Turkey, including human rights organizations and trade unions. Many people took to social media to express their outrage and sadness at the attack, and there were reports of numerous vigils and protests held across the country.\n\n#International reactions\n\nThe bombing was widely condemned by the international community, with numerous countries and organizations expressing their condolences to the victims and their families.\n\nThe United States, the European Union, and the United Nations all issued statements condemning the attack and urging calm. Other countries, including Russia and China, also expressed their condolences and offered support to the Turkish government.\n\n#See also\n\n* List of terrorist incidents in Turkey\n* Islamic State-Turkey conflict\n* PKK-Turkey conflict\n* 2015 Istanbul bombing\n* 2016 Istanbul bombing", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Istanbul_bombing\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Islamic State-Turkey conflict\n##PKK-Turkey conflict\n#Bombing\n#Victims\n#Investigation\n##State investigation\n##Kurdish forces denials and investigation\n##MHP connection\n##Other events\n#Aftermath\n#Internal reactions\n##Government politicians\n##Opposition\n##Civil reactions\n#International reactions\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

However, this article focuses on the major escalation that started in 2022. The conflict has resulted in significant loss of life, displacement of people, and economic disruption.\n\n# Prelude\n\nTensions between Russia and Ukraine have been escalating since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and supported separatist movements in eastern Ukraine. In the years leading up to the 2022 invasion, Russia continued to build up its military presence along the Ukrainian border. In December 2021, the United States and other Western countries warned of a potential Russian invasion, citing intelligence reports of a massive troop buildup.\n\nIn January 2022, Russia launched a series of military exercises near the Ukrainian border, which were widely seen as a show of force. Ukraine and its Western allies accused Russia of using the exercises as a pretext for an invasion. Meanwhile, Russia continued to deny any plans to invade Ukraine, claiming that its military presence was purely defensive.\n\n# Initial invasion\n\nOn February 24, 2022, Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine, with attacks on multiple fronts. The invasion began with a series of missile strikes on Ukrainian military targets, followed by a ground invasion from multiple directions. Russian forces quickly overran several key cities, including Kherson and Berdyansk, and began to push towards the capital city of Kyiv.\n\nThe initial invasion was marked by intense fighting, with both sides suffering significant losses. Ukrainian forces put up a strong resistance, but were ultimately unable to hold back the Russian advance.

Russian forces launched a major assault on the city of Mariupol, which was a strategic port city on the Sea of Azov. The city was heavily bombed, and Ukrainian forces were ultimately forced to retreat.\n\nThe fall of Mariupol gave Russian forces control of the Sea of Azov, allowing them to launch further attacks on Ukrainian ports. The city of Mykolaiv was also heavily bombed, and Ukrainian forces were forced to retreat from the city.\n\n## Key events of the southeastern front\n\n* February 25, 2022: Russian forces launch a major assault on the city of Mariupol.\n* February 27, 2022: Ukrainian forces retreat from Mariupol.\n* March 1, 2022: Russian forces capture the city of Mykolaiv.\n\n# 2022 Ukrainian counteroffensives\n\nIn the spring of 2022, Ukrainian forces launched a series of counteroffensives against Russian positions. The counteroffensives were marked by intense fighting, with both sides suffering significant losses.\n\nOne of the key areas of fighting was the city of Kharkiv, which had been captured by Russian forces during the initial invasion. Ukrainian forces launched a major counterattack on the city, and were ultimately able to retake it.\n\n## Key events of the 2022 Ukrainian counteroffensives\n\n* March 15, 2022: Ukrainian forces launch a major counterattack on the city of Kharkiv.\n* March 18, 2022: Ukrainian forces retake the city of Kharkiv.\n* April 1, 2022: Ukrainian forces launch a major counterattack on Russian positions in the Donbas region.\n\n# Second stalemate\n\nBy the summer of 2022, the conflict had reached a stalemate. Both sides were suffering significant losses, and neither was able to gain a decisive advantage.\n\nThe stalemate was marked by intense fighting, with both sides launching frequent attacks. However, neither side was able to make significant gains.\n\n## Key events of the second stalemate\n\n* June 1, 2022: Russian forces launch a major attack on Ukrainian positions in the Donbas region.\n* June 15, 2022: Ukrainian forces launch a major counterattack on Russian positions in the Donbas region.\n* July 1, 2022: The conflict reaches a stalemate, with neither side able to gain a decisive advantage.\n\n# 2023 Ukrainian counteroffensive\n\nIn the summer of 2023, Ukrainian forces launched a major counteroffensive against Russian positions. The counteroffensive was marked by intense fighting, with both sides suffering significant losses.\n\nOne of the key areas of fighting was the city of Bakhmut, which had been captured by Russian forces during the initial invasion. Ukrainian forces launched a major counterattack on the city, and were ultimately able to retake it.\n\n## Key events of the 2023 Ukrainian counteroffensive\n\n* June 15, 2023: Ukrainian forces launch a major counterattack on the city of Bakhmut.\n* June 18, 2023: Ukrainian forces retake the city of Bakhmut.\n* July 1, 2023: Ukrainian forces launch a major counterattack on Russian positions in the Donbas region.\n\n# Second winter campaign\n\nThe conflict is ongoing, with both sides continuing to launch attacks. The winter of 2023-2024 is expected to be particularly brutal, with both sides suffering significant losses.\n\nThe outcome of the conflict is uncertain, with neither side able to gain a decisive advantage.

The Boeing 737-800 aircraft, registration B-1791, was flying from Kunming to Guangzhou when it suddenly dived and crashed into a mountainous area, killing all 132 people on board.\n\n# Flight\n\nFlight 5735 departed Kunming Changshui International Airport at 13:16 local time (05:16 UTC) and was scheduled to arrive at Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport at 15:07 local time (07:07 UTC). The flight was crewed by three experienced pilots, and there were 123 passengers on board, including one infant. The flight was operated by China Eastern Airlines, one of China's major carriers.\n\nThe flight was uneventful until 14:20 local time (06:20 UTC), when air traffic control lost contact with the aircraft. The last transmission from the crew was a routine report of the aircraft's altitude and position. Shortly after, the aircraft's radar signal disappeared, and it was declared missing.\n\n# Background\n\n## Aircraft\n\nThe aircraft involved in the crash was a Boeing 737-800, registration B-1791, manufactured in 2015. The aircraft had been in service with China Eastern Airlines since its delivery and had accumulated over 18,000 flight hours. The 737-800 is a common narrow-body aircraft used for short- and medium-haul flights.\n\n## Passengers and crew\n\nThere were 123 passengers on board, including one infant, and three crew members. The passengers were mostly Chinese nationals, with a few foreigners, including one American and one Canadian. The crew consisted of two captains and one first officer, all of whom were experienced pilots.\n\n# Emergency response and recovery\n\nAfter the aircraft's disappearance, a search and rescue operation was launched, involving multiple government agencies, including the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), the Ministry of Emergency Management, and local authorities. The search area was focused on the mountains of Guangxi, where the aircraft's last known position was reported.\n\nOn the evening of March 21, the wreckage of the aircraft was located in a mountainous area of Guangxi, near the city of Wuzhou. The impact was severe, and the aircraft was destroyed. Rescue teams were dispatched to the site, but due to the remote location and harsh terrain, it took several hours to reach the wreckage.\n\nThe recovery efforts were challenging due to the difficult terrain and inclement weather. The wreckage was scattered over a large area, and the terrain made it difficult for rescue teams to access the site. The recovery operation involved multiple teams, including firefighters, paramedics, and search and rescue personnel.\n\n# Investigation\n\n## Initial investigation\n\nThe CAAC launched an investigation into the crash, which was assisted by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) of the United States and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The investigation was led by the CAAC, with assistance from Boeing and the engine manufacturer, CFM International.\n\nThe initial investigation focused on gathering evidence from the crash site, including the wreckage, debris, and flight data recorders. The flight data recorders were recovered from the crash site and sent to the CAAC's laboratory for analysis.\n\n## Preliminary report\n\nOn April 20, 2022, the CAAC released a preliminary report on the investigation. The report stated that the investigation was ongoing, but preliminary findings suggested that the crash was likely caused by a combination of factors, including pilot error and technical issues with the aircraft.\n\nThe report noted that the aircraft's flight data recorders showed that the aircraft had experienced a sudden and unexplained loss of altitude, followed by a steep dive. The report also noted that the pilots had made several attempts to recover the aircraft, but were unsuccessful.\n\n## Media reports of the investigation\n\nMedia reports suggested that the investigation had found evidence of pilot error, including a report from the Wall Street Journal that the pilots had been distracted by a conversation in the cockpit before the crash. Other reports suggested that the aircraft had experienced technical issues, including a malfunctioning autopilot system.\n\n## Interim report\n\nOn July 20, 2022, the CAAC released an interim report on the investigation. The report provided more detailed information on the investigation's findings, including analysis of the flight data recorders and cockpit voice recorders.\n\nThe report stated that the investigation had found evidence of a complex sequence of events leading up to the crash, including pilot error, technical issues with the aircraft, and a possible malfunction of the aircraft's autopilot system.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## Domestic\n\nThe crash was met with widespread shock and grief in China, with many people expressing condolences to the families of the victims. The government launched an investigation into the crash, and the CAAC announced that it would conduct a thorough review of China Eastern Airlines' safety procedures.\n\n## International\n\nThe international community also expressed condolences to the families of the victims. The United States, Canada, and other countries offered assistance to the investigation, and the International Air Transport Association (IATA) expressed its support for the CAAC's efforts to improve aviation safety in China.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of accidents and incidents involving the Boeing 737\n* List of accidents and incidents involving China Eastern Airlines\n\n# Notes\n\n* This article is a general overview of the crash and investigation.

He is considered one of the most important figures in the history of classical music, and his life and career are a testament to the triumph of talent over adversity.\n\nEarly Life\n-----------\n\nJoseph Boulogne was born on December 25, 1748, on the island of Guadeloupe, in the French West Indies. His father, Georges de Bologne Saint-Georges, was a wealthy plantation owner, and his mother, Nanon, was a slave. Joseph's early life was marked by privilege and luxury, and he received a thorough education in music, literature, and philosophy.\n\nMusical Life and Career\n-----------------------\n\nSaint-Georges began his musical studies at a young age, and by the time he was 18, he had moved to Paris to pursue a career in music. He quickly established himself as a virtuosic violinist and composer, and his music was performed by some of the most prominent musicians of the time. He was also a sought-after teacher, and his students included some of the most prominent musicians of the day.\n\nOperas\n-------\n\nSaint-Georges wrote several operas, including \"Ernestine\" and \"La Partie de Chasse\". His operas were known for their beautiful melodies and complex harmonies, and they were performed to great acclaim in Paris and other European cities.\n\nSocial Life in Paris\n--------------------\n\nSaint-Georges was a prominent figure in Parisian society, and he was known for his charm, wit, and good looks. He was a favorite of Queen Marie Antoinette, and he was often invited to perform at the Palace of Versailles. He was also a member of the prestigious Masonic lodge, Les Neuf Soeurs, which included many of the most prominent intellectuals and artists of the time.\n\nSt. Georges assaulted\n--------------------\n\nDespite his many successes, Saint-Georges faced numerous challenges and setbacks throughout his life. In 1787, he was assaulted by a group of thugs who were reportedly hired by a rival composer. The attack left him with serious injuries, and it took him several months to recover.\n\nTwo Trips to London\n-------------------\n\nSaint-Georges made two trips to London, in 1787 and 1790. During his first trip, he performed as a violinist and composer, and his music was received with great acclaim. He also met with many prominent musicians and composers, including Haydn and Mozart.\n\nSecond trip\n------------\n\nDuring his second trip to London, Saint-Georges performed as a conductor, and he led the orchestra in performances of his own music. He also gave a series of lectures on music theory and composition, and he was hailed as a leading authority in his field.\n\nLille\n------\n\nIn 1790, Saint-Georges moved to Lille, where he became the conductor of the city's orchestra. He remained in Lille for several years, and during that time, he wrote some of his most important music.\n\nMilitary Career\n----------------\n\nIn 1792, Saint-Georges joined the French army, and he became a lieutenant colonel in the Légion St-Georges. He fought bravely in several battles, and he was wounded in combat.\n\nPossible Saint-Domingue Visit\n-----------------------------\n\nThere is some evidence to suggest that Saint-Georges may have visited Saint-Domingue (present-day Haiti) in the late 1790s. During his visit, he may have met with Toussaint L'Ouverture, the leader of the Haitian Revolution.\n\nDeath\n------\n\nSaint-Georges died on June 10, 1799, in Paris. The cause of his death is not known, but it is thought to have been related to a lung infection.\n\nHome\n-----\n\nSaint-Georges lived in several different homes throughout his life, including a luxurious mansion in Paris and a country estate in Lille. His homes were always filled with music, and he was known to have hosted many lavish parties and musical gatherings.\n\nWorks\n------\n\nSaint-Georges was a prolific composer, and his music includes operas, symphonies, concertos, and chamber music.\n\nOperas\n-------\n\n* \"Ernestine\" (1777)\n* \"La Partie de Chasse\" (1778)\n\nSymphonies\n------------\n\n* Symphony in G major (1781)\n* Symphony in D major (1785)\n\nConcertante\n-------------\n\n### Violin concertos\n\n* Violin Concerto in D major (1773)\n* Violin Concerto in B flat major (1776)\n\n### Symphonies concertantes\n\n* Sinfonia Concertante in A major (1779)\n* Sinfonia Concertante in B flat major (1781)\n\nChamber music\n-------------\n\n### Sonatas\n\n* Violin Sonata in A major (1774)\n* Violin Sonata in E flat major (1776)\n\n### String quartet\n\n* String Quartet in C major (1777)\n\nVocal music\n------------\n\n* \"Ariette\" (1775)\n* \"Rondo\" (1778)\n\nDubious works\n-------------\n\nSome of Saint-Georges' works are considered dubious, as they were not published during his lifetime and their authorship is not certain.\n\nDiscography\n------------\n\n### Symphonies concertantes\n\n* Sinfonia Concertante in A major (1779) - performed by the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment (1995)\n* Sinfonia Concertante in B flat major (1781) - performed by the London Symphony Orchestra (1999)\n\n### Symphonies\n\n* Symphony in G major (1781) - performed by the Philharmonia Orchestra (1997)\n* Symphony in D major (1785) - performed by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (2001)\n\n### Violin concertos\n\n* Violin Concerto in D major (1773) - performed by the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra (1995)\n* Violin Concerto in B flat major (1776) - performed by the London Symphony Orchestra (2000)\n\n### Chamber music\n\n* Violin Sonata in A major (1774) - performed by the duo of Anne-Sophie Mutter and Lambert Orkis (1998)\n* String Quartet in C major (1777) - performed by the Emerson String Quartet (2002)\n\n### Miscellaneous\n\n* \"Ariette\" (1775) - performed by the soprano Cecilia Bartoli (1999)\n* \"Rondo\" (1778) - performed by the pianist Lang Lang (2001)\n\nIn popular culture\n-------------------\n\nSaint-Georges has been the subject of several films, plays, and novels.

The season began on 13 August 2021 and concluded on 22 May 2022. Manchester City successfully defended their title, winning their fourth Premier League trophy and sixth top-flight title overall.\n\n# Summary\n\n## The race for first place\n\nThe title race was dominated by Manchester City and Liverpool, with both teams trading blows throughout the season. Manchester City ultimately emerged victorious, winning the title by a single point. The Citizens' consistency and depth were key factors in their success, as they lost only six games all season. Liverpool, on the other hand, were hampered by injuries to key players, including Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mané.\n\n## Newcastle takeover\n\nThe season saw a significant change in ownership at Newcastle United, as a consortium backed by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) completed a takeover of the club in October 2021. The deal, worth £305 million, marked the end of Mike Ashley's 14-year tenure as owner. The takeover led to increased investment in the team and a change in management, with Eddie Howe replacing Steve Bruce as head coach.\n\n## COVID-19 outbreaks force postponements\n\nThe season was disrupted by COVID-19 outbreaks, which forced the postponement of several matches. The Premier League introduced new guidelines in December 2021, allowing clubs to request postponements if they had fewer than 13 available players, including a goalkeeper. The changes led to criticism from some clubs, who felt that the rules were being applied inconsistently.\n\n## Abramovich sanctions\n\nIn March 2022, Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich was sanctioned by the UK government due to his alleged ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The sanctions led to a freeze on Abramovich's assets, including Chelsea FC, and prevented the club from selling tickets or merchandise. The club was eventually sold to a consortium led by Todd Boehly in May 2022.\n\n## Final day climax\n\nThe final day of the season saw a dramatic climax, as Manchester City came from behind to defeat Aston Villa 3-2 and win the title. Liverpool, who needed City to slip up to win the title, defeated Wolverhampton Wanderers 3-1 but ultimately fell short.\n\n### Title\n\nManchester City won their fourth Premier League title, and sixth top-flight title overall, with a total of 93 points.\n\n### Relegation\n\nBurnley, Watford, and Norwich City were relegated to the EFL Championship, with the latter two returning to the second tier after just one season in the Premier League.\n\n### Champions League, Europa League and Conference League spots\n\nThe top four teams in the Premier League qualified for the Champions League, with Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea, and Tottenham Hotspur securing spots. Manchester United and West Ham United qualified for the Europa League, while Leicester City secured a spot in the Europa Conference League.\n\n# Teams\n\n## Stadiums and locations\n\nThe season saw 20 teams compete, with the same teams as the previous season. The teams were based in England and Wales, with Wolverhampton Wanderers being the most northerly team and Southampton being the most southerly.\n\n## Personnel and kits\n\nEach team had a different manager and playing staff, with some teams making significant changes during the season. The teams also had different kit sponsors and designs.\n\n## Managerial changes\n\nThere were several managerial changes during the season, with some teams making multiple changes. The most notable change was the appointment of Ralf Rangnick as Manchester United's interim manager, following the sacking of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.\n\n# League table\n\nThe final league table saw Manchester City win the title with 93 points, ahead of Liverpool on 92 points. Chelsea finished third with 74 points, while Tottenham Hotspur finished fourth with 71 points. The bottom three teams were Burnley, Watford, and Norwich City, who were relegated to the EFL Championship.\n\n# Results\n\nThe season saw a total of 380 matches played, with Manchester City and Liverpool dominating the top of the table. The season also saw some notable upsets, including Leicester City's 4-2 win over Manchester City in December 2021.\n\n# Season statistics\n\n## Top scorers\n\nThe top scorer in the Premier League was Mohamed Salah, who scored 23 goals for Liverpool. Harry Kane was second with 17 goals for Tottenham Hotspur, while Cristiano Ronaldo was third with 18 goals for Manchester United.\n\n### Hat-tricks\n\nThere were several hat-tricks scored during the season, with the most notable being Jack Harrison's hat-trick for Leeds United against West Ham United in January 2022.\n\n## Clean sheets\n\nThe team with the most clean sheets was Manchester City, who kept 22 clean sheets throughout the season.

The coup marked the end of Bongo's 14-year rule and led to the establishment of a new interim government.\n\nBackground\n\nGabon, a central African country with a population of approximately 2.2 million people, has a history of authoritarian rule and limited democratic freedoms. Ali Bongo Ondimba, who had been in power since 2009, had faced growing opposition and criticism for his government's human rights record, corruption, and economic mismanagement.\n\n## 2023 elections\n\nIn the months leading up to the coup, Gabon had been preparing for presidential elections scheduled for August 2023. However, the electoral process was marred by controversy and opposition allegations of rigging. The opposition had also criticized the electoral commission for its lack of independence and impartiality.\n\nCoup\n\nThe coup began on the night of August 30, 2023, when a group of military officers, led by General Brice Oligui, seized key government buildings and institutions in the capital city, Libreville. The military announced that it had taken control of the country and declared a curfew.\n\n## Events\n\nThe coup unfolded rapidly, with the military deploying troops throughout the city and surrounding areas. The presidential palace was surrounded, and President Bongo was reportedly taken into custody. The military also took control of key infrastructure, including the airport, seaport, and state media outlets.\n\n## Arrests of Ali Bongo and other officials\n\nPresident Bongo, along with several high-ranking officials, including the prime minister and the speaker of the national assembly, were arrested and detained by the military. The military announced that the detentions were necessary to prevent them from fleeing the country or interfering with the transition process.\n\n## Proclamation of Brice Oligui as interim president\n\nOn August 31, 2023, General Brice Oligui, the leader of the coup, declared himself interim president of Gabon. Oligui, a career military officer, had previously served as the chief of staff of the armed forces. He vowed to restore stability and security to the country and to oversee a transition to democratic rule.\n\nAftermath\n\nThe aftermath of the coup saw the establishment of a new government and the release of President Bongo from detention.\n\n## Formation of a new government\n\nOn September 5, 2023, General Oligui announced the formation of a new government, comprising a mix of military officers and civilians. The government included representatives from various opposition parties and civil society organizations. The new government vowed to address the country's pressing economic and social challenges.\n\n## Bongo's release\n\nOn September 10, 2023, President Bongo was released from detention and placed under house arrest. The military announced that Bongo would face trial for alleged corruption and human rights abuses during his rule.\n\nReactions\n\nThe coup and its aftermath generated mixed reactions both domestically and internationally.\n\n## Domestic\n\nThe opposition welcomed the coup, seeing it as an opportunity to bring about democratic change and an end to authoritarian rule. However, some opposition figures expressed concerns about the military's role in the transition process and the lack of clarity on the country's future.\n\n## International\n\nThe international community reacted cautiously to the coup, with many countries calling for calm and restraint. The African Union and the Economic Community of Central African States condemned the coup and called for the restoration of constitutional order. The United Nations Secretary-General urged the parties to engage in dialogue and to respect human rights.\n\nSee also\n\n* 2016 Gabonese presidential election\n* 2019 Gabonese legislative election\n* Gabonese Civil War\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n* Official website of the Government of Gabon\n* Official website of the African Union\n* Official website of the United Nations", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Gabonese_coup_d'état\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##2023 elections\n#Coup\n##Events\n##Arrests of Ali Bongo and other officials\n##Proclamation of Brice Oligui as interim president\n#Aftermath\n##Formation of a new government\n##Bongo's release\n#Reactions\n##Domestic\n##International\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

In the United States, the National Weather Service reported that the average temperature on New Year's Day was 24°F (-4°C), making it one of the coldest starts to a year in decades. Meanwhile, in Europe, a severe cold snap had been gripping the continent for weeks, with temperatures plummeting to -20°C (-4°F) in some areas.\n\n## United States\n\nIn the United States, President Richard Nixon delivered his annual New Year's message, calling for Americans to come together and support his administration's efforts to end the Vietnam War. However, the President's message was overshadowed by growing concerns about the economy, which had been experiencing a slowdown in the months leading up to the New Year.\n\n## International\n\nInternationally, the New Year brought little respite from the ongoing conflicts and tensions that had marked the previous year. In the Middle East, the 1973 Arab-Israeli War was still fresh in the minds of world leaders, and the fragile ceasefire that had been brokered in November 1973 was still holding. However, tensions between Israel and its Arab neighbors remained high, and the prospects for a lasting peace seemed remote.\n\n# January 2, 1974 (Wednesday)\n\nAs the New Year got underway, the world's attention turned to the ongoing energy crisis. The 1973 oil embargo, which had been imposed by Arab oil-producing nations in response to the United States' support for Israel, was still in effect, and oil prices continued to skyrocket. In the United States, the price of gasoline had risen to an average of 38 cents per gallon, up from 25 cents per gallon just a year earlier.\n\n## United States\n\nIn the United States, the energy crisis was having a major impact on the economy. The country's GDP had contracted by 2.1% in the fourth quarter of 1973, the largest decline since the 1960 recession. The unemployment rate, which had been steadily rising throughout 1973, had reached 5.5% by the end of the year, up from 4.9% in January 1973.\n\n## International\n\nInternationally, the energy crisis was also having a major impact. In Europe, the high cost of oil was contributing to a severe economic downturn, with many countries experiencing their worst recessions in decades. In Japan, the energy-intensive economy was particularly vulnerable to the oil price shock, and the country's GDP had contracted by 3.2% in the fourth quarter of 1973.\n\n# January 3, 1974 (Thursday)\n\nAs the energy crisis continued to dominate the headlines, the world's attention turned to the ongoing negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union. The two superpowers had been engaged in talks aimed at reducing their nuclear arsenals, but the negotiations had been slow-going.\n\n## United States\n\nIn the United States, President Nixon was facing growing pressure to take action to address the energy crisis. The President had promised to deliver a comprehensive energy plan to Congress, but the plan had been delayed repeatedly. Meanwhile, the Democratic-controlled Congress was considering its own energy legislation, which would have imposed price controls on gasoline and other petroleum products.\n\n## International\n\nInternationally, the negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union were seen as a crucial step towards reducing the risk of nuclear war. The two superpowers had been engaged in a nuclear arms race for decades, and the negotiations offered a chance to slow the pace of the arms race. However, the talks were complicated by ongoing tensions between the two countries, including disagreements over the Middle East and Eastern Europe.\n\n# January 4, 1974 (Friday)\n\nAs the week drew to a close, the world's attention turned to the ongoing conflict in Vietnam. The Paris Peace Accords, which had been signed in January 1973, had officially ended the United States' involvement in the war, but fighting between North and South Vietnamese forces continued.\n\n## United States\n\nIn the United States, the debate over the Vietnam War continued to simmer. Many Americans were still opposed to the war, and the anti-war movement remained a powerful force on college campuses and in cities across the country. However, others continued to support the war effort, arguing that the United States had a duty to defend its allies in Southeast Asia.\n\n## International\n\nInternationally, the ongoing conflict in Vietnam was seen as a major challenge to regional stability. The war had already had a major impact on the economies of Southeast Asia, and the ongoing fighting was contributing to a growing humanitarian crisis. The international community was calling for a ceasefire and a negotiated settlement to the conflict, but the prospects for a lasting peace seemed remote.\n\n# January 5, 1974 (Saturday)\n\nAs the weekend began, the world's attention turned to the ongoing energy crisis.

The attack was carried out by the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), a separatist militant group seeking independence for Kosovo from Serbia. The incident resulted in significant casualties and marked a turning point in the escalating conflict in Kosovo.\n\n#Background\n\nThe Kosovo conflict began in the early 1990s, with tensions rising between the ethnic Albanian majority and the ethnic Serb minority in the province. The KLA, formed in the mid-1990s, sought to establish an independent Kosovo through armed struggle. The Yugoslav government, led by President Slobodan Milošević, responded with force, leading to a cycle of violence and repression.\n\nIn the months leading up to the Banjska attack, the conflict had intensified, with both sides engaging in guerrilla warfare, ambushes, and attacks on civilians. The international community had attempted to broker a peace agreement, but negotiations had stalled.\n\n#Attack\n\nOn July 3, 1998, a group of KLA fighters launched a surprise attack on the town of Banjska, which was under the control of the Yugoslav army. The attack began at dawn, with the KLA fighters using small arms, mortars, and rocket-propelled grenades to target Yugoslav army positions.\n\n##Weaponry\n\nThe KLA fighters were reportedly armed with a mix of small arms, including AK-47 rifles, machine guns, and sniper rifles. They also used mortars and rocket-propelled grenades to attack Yugoslav army positions. The Yugoslav army responded with artillery and tank fire, which caused significant damage to the town.\n\n##Attackers\n\nThe KLA fighters who carried out the attack were reportedly local residents who had been recruited by the KLA in the months leading up to the incident. The group was led by a seasoned commander who had experience fighting against the Yugoslav army.\n\n##Casualties\n\nThe Banjska attack resulted in significant casualties on both sides. According to reports, at least 20 Yugoslav soldiers were killed, along with several civilians. The KLA also suffered losses, with reports suggesting that at least 10 fighters were killed.\n\n#Aftermath\n\nThe Banjska attack marked a turning point in the Kosovo conflict, with both sides escalating their military campaigns in the following months.\n\n##Resolutions\n\n###Kosovo and Albania\n\nThe KLA and the Albanian government condemned the Yugoslav government's response to the attack, calling for international intervention to protect Kosovo's civilians. The Albanian government also provided military support to the KLA, which helped to escalate the conflict.\n\n###European Union\n\nThe European Union condemned the violence on both sides, calling for a peaceful resolution to the conflict.
