The outbreak was one of the deadliest and costliest in U.S. history, causing widespread destruction and loss of life.\n\n# Meteorological Synopsis\n\nThe outbreak was fueled by a potent combination of atmospheric instability, moisture, and wind shear, which created a highly favorable environment for tornadoes to develop and intensify.\n\n## March 24–25\n\nOn March 24, a strong low-pressure system developed over the Rocky Mountains, bringing with it a cold front that stretched from the Great Plains to the Gulf Coast. As the front interacted with a warm, humid air mass from the Gulf of Mexico, thunderstorms began to develop across the Southeast. By the evening of March 24, a few isolated tornadoes had touched down across parts of Louisiana and Mississippi.\n\n## March 26–27\n\nAs the low-pressure system moved eastward, the cold front stalled across the Southeast, allowing the warm, humid air to push northward and create a highly unstable atmosphere. This led to a significant increase in tornado activity, with multiple tornadoes reported across parts of Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia. The outbreak peaked on the evening of March 26, with multiple long-lived tornadoes causing widespread destruction.\n\n# Confirmed Tornadoes\n\nA total of 104 tornadoes were confirmed across six states during the outbreak, with the majority occurring on March 26.\n\n## March 24 Event\n\n* 5 tornadoes confirmed across Louisiana and Mississippi\n* EF1 tornado in Lincoln Parish, Louisiana, caused significant damage to homes and buildings\n* EF0 tornado in Adams County, Mississippi, caused minor damage to trees and power lines\n\n## March 25 Event\n\n* 12 tornadoes confirmed across parts of Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia\n* EF2 tornado in Lowndes County, Mississippi, caused significant damage to homes and buildings\n* EF1 tornado in Marengo County, Alabama, caused moderate damage to trees and power lines\n\n## March 26 Event\n\n* 43 tornadoes confirmed across parts of Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia\n* EF4 tornado in Winston County, Mississippi, caused catastrophic damage to homes and buildings\n* EF3 tornado in Marshall County, Alabama, caused significant damage to homes and buildings\n\n## March 27 Event\n\n* 20 tornadoes confirmed across parts of Georgia and the Carolinas\n* EF2 tornado in Floyd County, Georgia, caused significant damage to homes and buildings\n* EF1 tornado in Pickens County, South Carolina, caused moderate damage to trees and power lines\n\n## Rolling Fork–Midnight–Silver City, Mississippi\n\nA long-lived EF4 tornado touched down in Rolling Fork, Mississippi, causing catastrophic damage to homes and buildings. The tornado traveled 45 miles, causing widespread destruction and loss of life.\n\n## Black Hawk–Winona, Mississippi\n\nA long-lived EF3 tornado touched down in Black Hawk, Mississippi, causing significant damage to homes and buildings. The tornado traveled 25 miles, causing widespread destruction and loss of life.\n\n## Egypt–New Wren–Amory–Smithville, Mississippi\n\nA long-lived EF3 tornado touched down in Egypt, Mississippi, causing significant damage to homes and buildings. The tornado traveled 35 miles, causing widespread destruction and loss of life.\n\n## North West Point–Smiths Mill–Pine Mountain, Georgia\n\nA long-lived EF2 tornado touched down in North West Point, Georgia, causing significant damage to homes and buildings. The tornado traveled 20 miles, causing widespread destruction and loss of life.\n\n# Non-Tornadic Effects\n\nIn addition to the tornadoes, the outbreak produced significant non-tornadic effects, including:\n\n* Heavy rain and flash flooding across parts of the Southeast\n* Strong winds and hail across parts of the Southeast\n* Isolated power outages across parts of the Southeast\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe outbreak caused widespread destruction and loss of life, with multiple communities affected.\n\n## Political Response\n\nThe governor of Mississippi declared a state of emergency in response to the outbreak, mobilizing state resources to support affected communities.

He has been a Member of Parliament since 1977 and has been the leader of the United National Party (UNP) since 1994.\n\nEarly life and education\n------------------------\n\nRanil Wickremesinghe was born on March 24, 1949, in Colombo, Sri Lanka, to Esmond Wickremesinghe and Nalini Wickremesinghe (née Wijewardena). His father was a politician and a lawyer, and his mother was a social worker. Wickremesinghe was educated at the Royal College, Colombo, and later at the University of Ceylon, where he studied law.

The incident became a major controversy, and Wickremesinghe was eventually cleared of any wrongdoing. However, the incident continues to be a subject of debate and controversy.\n\nFirst premiership (1993–1994)\n---------------------------\n\nIn 1993, Wickremesinghe became the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka, following the assassination of President Ranasinghe Premadasa.

During his tenure, he initiated several economic reforms and started peace talks with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).\n\n### Peace talks\n\nThe peace talks, which were facilitated by Norway, aimed to bring an end to the civil war that had been ongoing since 1983. However, the talks ultimately failed, and the conflict continued.\n\nOpposition (2004–2015)\n----------------------\n\n### 2005 presidential election\n\nIn 2005, Wickremesinghe contested the presidential election against Mahinda Rajapaksa, the leader of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP). Wickremesinghe lost the election, and Rajapaksa became the President of Sri Lanka.\n\n### Dissent within the UNP\n\nDuring this period, there was significant dissent within the UNP, with several members opposing Wickremesinghe's leadership. However, Wickremesinghe managed to maintain his position as the leader of the party.\n\n### End of the civil war and 2010 presidential election\n\nIn 2009, the civil war came to an end, with the defeat of the LTTE. In 2010, Wickremesinghe contested the presidential election against Mahinda Rajapaksa, but he lost. Rajapaksa continued to serve as the President of Sri Lanka until 2015.\n\nThird, fourth and fifth premierships (2015–2019)\n------------------------------------------\n\nIn 2015, Wickremesinghe became the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka for a third time, following the general election. He served as Prime Minister until 2019, when he was defeated in the presidential election.\n\n### Foreign policy\n\nDuring his tenure, Wickremesinghe focused on strengthening Sri Lanka's relationships with other countries, particularly with India and China. He also played a key role in Sri Lanka's bid to join the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC).\n\n### Government bonds controversy\n\nIn 2015, Wickremesinghe was involved in a controversy surrounding the issuance of government bonds.

Wickremesinghe continued to serve as the leader of the opposition.\n\nSixth premiership (2022)\n------------------------\n\nIn 2022, Wickremesinghe became the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka for a sixth time, following the resignation of Mahinda Rajapaksa. He served as Prime Minister until he was elected as the President of Sri Lanka in July 2022.\n\nPresidency (2022–2024)\n-------------------\n\n### Crackdown on anti-government protests\n\nIn 2022, Wickremesinghe's government was criticized for its crackdown on anti-government protests. The protests, which were sparked by the country's economic crisis, were met with force by the police and military.\n\n### Handling of economic crisis\n\nWickremesinghe's government has been criticized for its handling of the economic crisis, which has led to shortages of food, fuel, and other essential items.\n\n### 2023 local government elections\n\nIn 2023, Wickremesinghe's government held local government elections, which were seen as a test of his popularity.

The incident sparked widespread protests and calls for police reform, particularly in the wake of the release of body camera footage showing the events leading up to Walker's death.\n\n#Background\n\nJayland Walker was a 25-year-old African American man who lived in Akron, Ohio. He worked as a food delivery driver and was described by friends and family as a kind and gentle person. On the evening of June 27, 2022, Walker was driving his car when he was pulled over by Akron police officers in the city's North Hill neighborhood. The traffic stop was initiated due to an alleged traffic violation, although the exact nature of the infraction is disputed.\n\n#Incident\n\nAccording to the Akron Police Department, Walker fled the scene on foot after being pulled over, leading to a chase involving multiple police officers. The officers claimed that Walker had posed a threat to their safety, although the exact circumstances of the threat are not clear. During the chase, Walker was shot and killed by the police officers. The incident was captured on body camera footage, which was later released to the public.\n\n#Investigation\n\nThe Ohio Bureau of Investigation (BIC) launched an investigation into the killing of Jayland Walker, which was later taken over by the Ohio Attorney General's office. The investigation included a review of the body camera footage, witness statements, and forensic evidence. In September 2022, a grand jury was convened to consider charges against the police officers involved in the shooting. After several days of deliberation, the grand jury declined to indict the officers, sparking widespread protests and criticism.\n\n##Body camera footage\n\nIn July 2022, the Akron Police Department released body camera footage of the incident, which showed the events leading up to Walker's death. The footage showed Walker fleeing the scene on foot, followed by police officers. The officers can be heard shouting at Walker to stop, and at one point, an officer yells \"he's got a gun.\" However, it is not clear from the footage whether Walker actually had a gun or posed a threat to the officers. The footage also showed the officers firing multiple shots at Walker, who was struck by at least 60 bullets.\n\n#Reactions\n\nThe killing of Jayland Walker sparked widespread protests and calls for police reform in Akron and beyond. Many activists and community leaders criticized the police department's handling of the incident, arguing that the officers had used excessive force and that Walker's death was avoidable. The incident also led to renewed calls for police reform, including the implementation of body cameras and de-escalation training for officers.\n\n##Family reaction to grand jury decision\n\nWalker's family was critical of the grand jury's decision not to indict the police officers involved in the shooting. In a statement, Walker's mother, Pamela Walker, said that she was \"disappointed but not surprised\" by the decision, and that she would continue to fight for justice for her son. Walker's family has filed a civil lawsuit against the city of Akron and the police officers involved in the shooting, seeking damages and reforms to the police department's policies and procedures.\n\n#See also\n\n* List of unarmed African Americans killed by law enforcement officers in the United States\n* Police brutality in the United States\n* Black Lives Matter\n\n#References\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)\n\n#External links\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Killing_of_Jayland_Walker\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Incident\n#Investigation\n#Body camera footage\n#Reactions\n##Family reaction to grand jury decision\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is the largest census-designated place in Maui County and was once the capital of the Kingdom of Hawaii. The town is known for its rich cultural heritage, stunning natural beauty, and vibrant arts scene.\n\n# History\n\n## Name\n\n### Modern name, etymology and pronunciations\n\nThe modern name \"Lahaina\" is derived from the Hawaiian words \"la\" meaning \"day\" and \"haina\" meaning \"cruel sun\". This refers to the town's location on the leeward coast of Maui, where the sun's rays are particularly strong. The pronunciation of Lahaina is often anglicized to \"la-HAY-nah\", although the traditional Hawaiian pronunciation is more like \"LAH-hah-nah\".\n\n### Ancient names\n\nIn ancient times, Lahaina was known by several other names, including \"Lele\" and \"Mokuhinia\". The name \"Lele\" refers to the town's location near the Lele stream, while \"Mokuhinia\" is the name of the nearby island that is now connected to the mainland by a causeway.\n\n## Early rulers\n\nLahaina was an important center of power and politics in ancient Hawaii. The town was ruled by a series of ali'i (chiefs) who were descended from the great Hawaiian chief, Pi'ilani. One of the most famous rulers of Lahaina was Kahekili II, who united the islands of Maui, Lanai, and Molokai under his rule in the 18th century.\n\n## Western contact\n\n### Kahekili II\n\nKahekili II was the first ruler of Lahaina to make contact with Westerners. In 1786, he met with the French explorer Jean-François de La Pérouse, who had arrived in Lahaina with two ships. Kahekili II was friendly towards La Pérouse and his men, and the two leaders exchanged gifts and ideas.\n\n### Kamehameha I and Kamehameha II\n\nIn the early 19th century, Lahaina was visited by two of the most famous rulers in Hawaiian history: Kamehameha I and Kamehameha II. Kamehameha I, also known as Kamehameha the Great, united the islands of Hawaii under one rule and established the Kingdom of Hawaii. His son, Kamehameha II, succeeded him as king and continued to develop Lahaina as a major center of commerce and trade.\n\n### Christian missionaries\n\nIn 1820, a group of Christian missionaries arrived in Lahaina, led by the Reverend Hiram Bingham. The missionaries established a church and a school in the town, and began to convert the local population to Christianity. The arrival of the missionaries had a profound impact on Lahaina, as it introduced Western values and customs to the town.\n\n### Whaling\n\nIn the mid-19th century, Lahaina became a major whaling port. Whalers from around the world came to the town to hunt sperm whales, which were abundant in the waters off Maui. The whaling industry brought great wealth to Lahaina, but it also had a negative impact on the town's environment and culture.\n\n### Kamehameha III\n\nKamehameha III, also known as Kauikeaouli, was the third king of the Kingdom of Hawaii. He ruled from 1825 until his death in 1854, and during his reign, Lahaina became an even more important center of commerce and trade. Kamehameha III was a just and fair ruler, and he worked to modernize Hawaii and bring it into the international community.\n\n### 20th century\n\nIn the 20th century, Lahaina underwent significant changes. The town became a popular tourist destination, and many of its historic buildings were restored and preserved. The sugar industry, which had been a major part of Lahaina's economy for many years, declined in the mid-20th century, and the town began to focus more on tourism and services.\n\n## 2023 wildfire\n\nIn August 2023, a devastating wildfire swept through Lahaina, destroying hundreds of buildings and forcing thousands of people to evacuate. The fire, which was caused by a combination of strong winds and dry conditions, was one of the largest and most destructive in Hawaiian history. The people of Lahaina came together to respond to the disaster, and the town is currently in the process of rebuilding and recovering.\n\n# Geography\n\nLahaina is located on the west coast of the island of Maui, Hawaii. The town is situated on a coastal plain that is surrounded by mountains and volcanoes. The climate in Lahaina is tropical, with high temperatures and high levels of humidity throughout the year.\n\n## Climate\n\nLahaina has a tropical savanna climate, with high temperatures and high levels of humidity throughout the year. The average temperature in Lahaina is around 70°F (21°C), although it can get much hotter during the summer months. The town experiences a dry season from April to October, and a wet season from November to March.\n\n# Demographics\n\nAs of the 2020 census, the population of Lahaina was 12,702 people. The town has a diverse population, with people of Hawaiian, Asian, American, and European ancestry. The median age in Lahaina is around 40 years old, and the median household income is around $60,000 per year.\n\n# Arts and culture\n\nLahaina is known for its rich cultural heritage and vibrant arts scene. The town is home to many galleries, museums, and performance venues, and it hosts a number of festivals and events throughout the year. Some of the most popular attractions in Lahaina include the Lahaina Heritage Trail, the Lahaina Museum, and the Maui Theatre.\n\n# Sports\n\nLahaina is home to a number of sports teams, including the Lahaina Cannons, a baseball team that plays in the Maui Baseball League. The town also has a number of parks and recreation facilities, including the Lahaina Recreation Center and the Lahaina Skate Park.\n\n# Popular culture\n\nLahaina has been featured in a number of films, television shows, and books. Some of the most famous depictions of Lahaina include the movie \"The Descendants\", which was filmed in part in the town, and the book \"The Whales of Maui\", which tells the story of the whaling industry in Lahaina.\n\n# Gallery\n\n* A photo of the Lahaina waterfront\n* A picture of the Lahaina Heritage Trail\n* A photo of the Lahaina Museum\n* A picture of the Maui Theatre\n\n# See also\n\n* Maui, Hawaii\n* Kingdom of Hawaii\n* Whaling in Hawaii\n* Christian missionaries in Hawaii\n* Lahaina Heritage Trail\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article uses the Hawaiian language and cultural practices to describe the history and culture of Lahaina.

The outbreak produced a total of 83 confirmed tornadoes across 10 states, resulting in at least 3 fatalities and numerous injuries. The outbreak was particularly notable for the long-lived supercell that produced the Gretna–Arabi–New Orleans East, Louisiana tornado, which caused significant damage and loss of life.\n\n#Meteorological Synopsis\n\n##March 21\n\nOn March 21, a powerful low-pressure system developed over the southern Great Plains, bringing with it a strong cold front and a dry line. As the system moved east, it interacted with a warm, humid air mass from the Gulf of Mexico, creating a highly unstable atmosphere. This led to the development of thunderstorms across the region, some of which became supercells capable of producing tornadoes.\n\n##March 22\n\nOn March 22, the low-pressure system continued to move east, bringing the cold front and dry line into the Southeast. The atmosphere remained highly unstable, with warm, humid air near the surface and cooler air aloft. This led to the development of numerous thunderstorms, including some that produced tornadoes. The most significant tornado-producing storms developed in the afternoon and evening hours, with several long-lived supercells producing multiple tornadoes.\n\n##March 23\n\nOn March 23, the low-pressure system had moved into the Mid-Atlantic, but the trailing cold front and dry line remained stalled across the Southeast. The atmosphere remained unstable, with continued warm, humid air near the surface and cooler air aloft. This led to the development of additional thunderstorms, including some that produced tornadoes. However, the tornado activity was not as widespread as it had been on the previous two days.\n\n#Confirmed Tornadoes\n\nA total of 83 tornadoes were confirmed across 10 states during the outbreak.\n\n##March 21 Event\n\nOn March 21, a total of 13 tornadoes were confirmed across Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas. The most significant tornado occurred in Wichita County, Texas, where an EF2 tornado caused significant damage and injured several people.\n\n##March 22 Event\n\nOn March 22, a total of 46 tornadoes were confirmed across Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia. The most significant tornadoes occurred in Louisiana, where several long-lived supercells produced multiple tornadoes, including the Gretna–Arabi–New Orleans East tornado.\n\n##March 23 Event\n\nOn March 23, a total of 24 tornadoes were confirmed across North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia. The most significant tornado occurred in Union County, North Carolina, where an EF2 tornado caused significant damage and injured several people.\n\n##Gretna–Arabi–New Orleans East, Louisiana\n\nThe Gretna–Arabi–New Orleans East tornado was a long-lived EF3 tornado that occurred on March 22. The tornado touched down in Gretna, Louisiana, and moved northeast, passing through the communities of Arabi and New Orleans East. The tornado caused significant damage and loss of life, with at least 3 fatalities and numerous injuries. The tornado was particularly notable for its unusual path, which took it through several densely populated areas.\n\n#Non-Tornadic Effects\n\nIn addition to the tornadoes, the outbreak produced significant non-tornadic effects, including large hail, damaging winds, and heavy rainfall. Several areas reported hail as large as baseballs, which caused significant damage to vehicles and buildings. The strongest winds were reported in Louisiana, where gusts reached up to 80 mph. Heavy rainfall also caused flash flooding in several areas, including New Orleans, where several streets were inundated.\n\n#Preparations and Impacts\n\nThe outbreak had significant impacts on the affected areas, with widespread power outages, property damage, and displacement of residents. Several schools and businesses were closed due to the severe weather, and many residents were forced to seek shelter in emergency shelters. The American Red Cross and other disaster relief organizations provided assistance to those affected.\n\n#Aftermath\n\nThe aftermath of the outbreak saw a significant response from emergency management officials, with damage assessments and recovery efforts underway. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) declared several counties in Louisiana and Mississippi as disaster areas, making them eligible for federal aid. The National Weather Service conducted a thorough review of the outbreak, including the tornadoes and non-tornadic effects.\n\n#See Also\n\n* Tornado outbreaks in the United States\n* List of tornadoes in the United States\n* List of tornado-related deaths in the United States\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is a general overview of the tornado outbreak of March 21–23, 2022.

The award is considered one of the most prestigious honors in the mountaineering community, and it is presented annually to climbers who have demonstrated exceptional skill, courage, and commitment to the sport.\n\n# History\n\nThe Piolets d'Or was first awarded in 1992 by the French magazine Montagnes, in partnership with the French Federation of Mountaineering and Climbing (FFME). The award was created to recognize and celebrate the achievements of climbers who had made significant contributions to the sport. Over the years, the award has evolved to include a broader range of categories and to recognize climbers from around the world.\n\n## Multiple winners\n\nSeveral climbers have won the Piolets d'Or multiple times, including Reinhold Messner, who won the award in 1993 and 2000, and Ueli Steck, who won the award in 2009 and 2014.

The award is presented in several categories, including best climb, best climber, and best expedition.

The award is seen as a pinnacle of achievement for climbers, and it is often referred to as the \"Oscar of mountaineering.\" However, the award has also been the subject of controversy and criticism over the years.\n\n## Criticism\n\nSome critics have argued that the Piolets d'Or is overly focused on extreme and high-risk climbs, and that it does not adequately recognize the achievements of climbers who have made significant contributions to the sport in other ways.

It was created as part of the Austrian conquest of the region, and its history is a complex interplay of imperial ambitions, local resistance, and cultural exchange.\n\n# History\n\n## Austrian conquest\n\nIn the early 18th century, the Habsburg Empire, under the rule of Emperor Charles VI, sought to expand its territories in Southeastern Europe. The region of Oltenia, where the Banat of Craiova would be established, was then part of the Ottoman Empire. In 1716, the Austrians launched a military campaign against the Ottomans, resulting in the capture of the city of Craiova in 1718. The region was subsequently incorporated into the Habsburg Empire, marking the beginning of Austrian rule in the area.\n\n## Government creation\n\nFollowing the conquest, the Austrians established the Banat of Craiova as a distinct administrative division, with its capital in the city of Craiova. The new government was tasked with implementing Austrian administrative and economic reforms, as well as promoting Catholicism in the region. The Banat was divided into several districts, each governed by an Austrian-appointed official. The local population, consisting of boyars (noble landowners) and peasants, was subject to Austrian taxation and military conscription.\n\n## Boyar and peasant resistance\n\nThe imposition of Austrian rule was met with resistance from the local boyar class, who resented the loss of their autonomy and privileges. Many boyars refused to recognize Austrian authority, and some even collaborated with the Ottomans in hopes of restoring Ottoman rule. The peasants, who bore the brunt of Austrian taxation and conscription policies, also grew increasingly discontent. Tensions between the Austrians and the local population simmered, eventually boiling over into open rebellion.\n\n## Austrian consolidation\n\nDespite the challenges posed by local resistance, the Austrians managed to consolidate their control over the Banat of Craiova. They implemented a series of measures aimed at pacifying the region, including the establishment of a permanent garrison in Craiova and the creation of a network of informants and spies. The Austrians also sought to win over the boyar class by offering them economic incentives and social privileges. Gradually, the region began to stabilize, and the Austrians were able to implement their administrative and economic reforms.\n\n## Ottoman reconquest\n\nHowever, Austrian control over the Banat of Craiova was short-lived. In 1739, the Ottomans launched a successful counterattack, capturing Craiova and driving the Austrians out of the region. The Banat of Craiova ceased to exist as an administrative division, and the region was reincorporated into the Ottoman Empire. The Austrians would not regain control over the area until the late 18th century, when they established the Province of Oltenia.\n\n# Legacy\n\n## \"Colonial\" precedent\n\nThe Banat of Craiova served as a precedent for later Austrian colonial endeavors in Eastern Europe. The administrative and economic reforms implemented in the Banat were later applied to other regions, including the Banat of Temeschwar and the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria. The experience gained by the Austrians in the Banat of Craiova also informed their policies in other colonial contexts, such as the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the late 19th century.\n\n## Cultural survivals\n\nDespite the brevity of Austrian rule in the Banat of Craiova, the region retains a distinctive cultural heritage. The Austrians introduced Catholicism to the area, and many locals converted to the faith. The region's architecture, cuisine, and folklore also reflect Austrian influences. The Banat of Craiova's legacy can be seen in the many Baroque-style buildings that dot the region, as well as in the local traditions and customs that have survived to this day.\n\n# Symbols\n\nThe Banat of Craiova does not have any official symbols, as it ceased to exist as an administrative division over two centuries ago. However, the region's cultural heritage is still celebrated through various festivals and events, which often feature traditional music, dance, and cuisine.\n\n# Notes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Banat_of_Craiova\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Austrian conquest\n##Government creation\n##Boyar and peasant resistance\n##Austrian consolidation\n##Ottoman reconquest\n#Legacy\n##\"Colonial\" precedent\n##Cultural survivals\n#Symbols\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The election was called to elect members of the Dewan Rakyat, the lower house of the Malaysian Parliament, and the state legislative assemblies.\n\n# Background\n\n## Previous Election\n\nThe previous general election was held in 2018, which saw the Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition, led by Mahathir Mohamad, securing a historic victory, ending the six-decade rule of the Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition.\n\n## Significant Events\n\nSince the 2018 election, Malaysia has witnessed significant events that have shaped the country's politics. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the country's economy and public health, leading to widespread criticism of the government's handling of the crisis. Additionally, the country has experienced a series of natural disasters, including floods and landslides, which have further strained the government's resources.\n\n## 2020–22 Political Crisis\n\nIn February 2020, a political crisis erupted when a faction of the PH coalition led by Mahathir Mohamad attempted to form a new government with the support of opposition parties, including the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO). The crisis led to the collapse of the PH government, and Muhyiddin Yassin was appointed as the new Prime Minister. However, his government faced numerous challenges, including a no-confidence vote in Parliament, which ultimately led to his resignation in August 2021. Ismail Sabri Yaakob succeeded Muhyiddin as Prime Minister, but his government also faced instability, and the parliament was eventually dissolved in October 2022.\n\n# Electoral System\n\nMalaysia uses a first-past-the-post electoral system, where voters cast a single ballot for their preferred candidate in a constituency. The candidate with the most votes wins the seat. The country is divided into 222 parliamentary constituencies, each electing one member to the Dewan Rakyat.\n\n# Timeline\n\n## Dissolution of Parliament\n\nOn 10 October 2022, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, King Al-Sultan Abdullah, dissolved the 14th Parliament, paving the way for the general election.\n\n## Dissolution of State Legislatures\n\nSeveral state legislatures, including those in Johor, Kedah, Kelantan, Negeri Sembilan, Pahang, Perlis, Sabah, Sarawak, and Terengganu, were also dissolved, with some states holding simultaneous elections.\n\n## Pre-Nomination Events\n\nThe Election Commission of Malaysia (EC) held a series of briefings and meetings with political parties and candidates to outline the rules and regulations for the election.\n\n## Timetable\n\nThe EC announced the election timetable, with nomination day set for 5 November 2022, and polling day scheduled for 19 November 2022.\n\n# Last Election Pendulum\n\nThe 2018 general election saw a significant swing against the BN coalition, with the PH coalition making substantial gains. The last election pendulum shows the number of seats won by each party and the margin of victory.\n\n# Political Parties and Candidates\n\n## Parties Represented in Current Legislatures\n\nSeveral parties are represented in the current legislatures, including:\n\n* Barisan Nasional (BN)\n* Pakatan Harapan (PH)\n* Perikatan Nasional (PN)\n* Parti Warisan Sabah (Warisan)\n* Parti Sarawak Bersatu (PSB)\n\n## Extra-Parliamentary Parties\n\nSeveral extra-parliamentary parties are also contesting the election, including:\n\n* Parti Sosialis Malaysia (PSM)\n* Parti Rakyat Malaysia (PRM)\n\n## Nominated Candidates\n\nA total of 1,853 candidates were nominated to contest the 222 parliamentary seats and 600 state assembly seats.\n\n# Campaign\n\n## Timing of Election\n\nThe election campaign officially began on 5 November 2022, with candidates and parties launching their campaigns across the country.\n\n## Youth Vote\n\nThe youth vote is expected to play a significant role in the election, with many young voters casting their ballots for the first time. Several parties have launched initiatives to engage with young voters and address their concerns.\n\n# Outgoing Members of Parliament\n\nSeveral outgoing members of parliament have announced that they will not be contesting the election, including:\n\n* Mahathir Mohamad\n* Anwar Ibrahim\n* Muhyiddin Yassin\n\n# Opinion Polls\n\nSeveral opinion polls have been conducted in the lead-up to the election, with some polls indicating a close contest between the major parties.\n\n# Results\n\n## By Alliance\n\nThe results of the election by alliance are as follows:\n\n* Pakatan Harapan (PH) - 82 seats\n* Perikatan Nasional (PN) - 73 seats\n* Barisan Nasional (BN) - 30 seats\n* Gabungan Parti Sarawak (GPS) - 23 seats\n* Parti Warisan Sabah (Warisan) - 3 seats\n\n## By Parliamentary Seats\n\nThe results of the election by parliamentary seat are as follows:\n\n* Pakatan Harapan (PH) - 82 seats\n* Perikatan Nasional (PN) - 73 seats\n* Barisan Nasional (BN) - 30 seats\n* Gabungan Parti Sarawak (GPS) - 23 seats\n* Parti Warisan Sabah (Warisan) - 3 seats\n\n## State Assemblies\n\nThe results of the election for state assemblies are as follows:\n\n* Johor - Barisan Nasional (BN)\n* Kedah - Perikatan Nasional (PN)\n* Kelantan - Perikatan Nasional (PN)\n* Negeri Sembilan - Pakatan Harapan (PH)\n* Pahang - Barisan Nasional (BN)\n* Perlis - Perikatan Nasional (PN)\n* Sabah - Gabungan Rakyat Sabah (GRS)\n* Sarawak - Gabungan Parti Sarawak (GPS)\n* Terengganu - Perikatan Nasional (PN)\n\n## Seats that Changed Allegiance\n\nSeveral seats changed allegiance in the election, including:\n\n* 23 seats won by Pakatan Harapan (PH) from Barisan Nasional (BN)\n* 15 seats won by Perikatan Nasional (PN) from Pakatan Harapan (PH)\n* 10 seats won by Barisan Nasional (BN) from Pakatan Harapan (PH)\n\n# Aftermath\n\n## Formation of Federal Government\n\nThe formation of the federal government is ongoing, with negotiations between parties to form a coalition government.\n\n## International Reactions\n\nThe international community has congratulated Malaysia on the successful conduct of the election, with several countries expressing their commitment to strengthening ties with the new government.\n\n# See Also\n\n* 2018 Malaysian general election\n* 2020 Malaysian political crisis\n* Malaysian general elections\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a factual report on the 2022 Malaysian general election.

The scandal led to the arrest of several high-ranking officials, including a vice-president of the European Parliament, and sparked widespread outrage and calls for greater transparency and accountability within the institution.\n\n# Allegations and events leading up to the arrests\n\nIn the months leading up to the arrests, there were growing concerns about the influence of foreign powers within the European Parliament. In particular, Qatar had been accused of attempting to exert undue influence over European politicians in order to advance its own interests. In July 2022, the European Parliament's main center-right group, the European People's Party, called for an investigation into allegations of corruption and undue influence by Qatar.\n\nIn November 2022, the European Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs (AFET) voted to adopt a resolution criticizing Qatar's human rights record and calling for greater transparency and accountability in the country's dealings with the European Union. The resolution was seen as a significant rebuke to Qatar, which had been attempting to improve its image in Europe through a series of high-profile lobbying efforts.\n\n# Investigation, raids and arrests\n\nOn December 9, 2022, Belgian police launched a series of raids on the homes and offices of several high-ranking officials within the European Parliament. The raids were part of a broader investigation into allegations of corruption and influence peddling by Qatar and other countries.\n\nFour people were arrested during the raids, including Eva Kaili, a Greek MEP and vice-president of the European Parliament. Kaili was one of the most senior officials to be arrested, and her detention sent shockwaves through the European Parliament.\n\nIn addition to Kaili, three other people were arrested: Francesco Giorgi, an Italian national who worked as a parliamentary assistant; Luca Visentini, an Italian national who was the general secretary of the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC); and Antonio Panzeri, an Italian MEP who was a member of the European Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs.\n\n# Connections with Morocco\n\nIn addition to Qatar, there were also allegations of corruption and influence peddling by Morocco within the European Parliament. Panzeri, one of the arrested MEPs, was accused of having close ties to the Moroccan government and of having accepted bribes from Moroccan officials in exchange for promoting the country's interests within the European Parliament.\n\nThe allegations of corruption and influence peddling by Morocco were seen as part of a broader pattern of behavior by the country, which had been accused of attempting to exert undue influence over European politicians in order to advance its own interests.\n\n# Connections with Mauritania\n\nThere were also allegations of corruption and influence peddling by Mauritania within the European Parliament. Niccolò Figà-Talamanca, an Italian national who worked as a parliamentary assistant, was accused of having close ties to the Mauritanian government and of having accepted bribes from Mauritanian officials in exchange for promoting the country's interests within the European Parliament.\n\n# Trial and prosecution\n\nThe trial of the arrested officials began in January 2023. Kaili, Giorgi, Visentini, and Panzeri all denied the allegations against them and maintained their innocence.\n\nThe prosecution presented a significant amount of evidence, including documents and witness testimony, which suggested that the defendants had accepted bribes from Qatari and Moroccan officials in exchange for promoting the countries' interests within the European Parliament.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## Political\n\nThe reaction to the scandal was swift and severe. The European Parliament's president, Roberta Metsola, condemned the allegations and called for greater transparency and accountability within the institution.\n\nThe leaders of the European Parliament's main political groups also condemned the allegations and called for a thorough investigation. The European People's Party, the Socialists and Democrats, and the Renew Europe group all issued statements condemning the allegations and calling for greater transparency and accountability.\n\n## Civil society\n\nCivil society organizations also reacted strongly to the scandal. Transparency International, a leading anti-corruption organization, called for a thorough investigation and greater transparency and accountability within the European Parliament.\n\n## Government of Qatar\n\nThe government of Qatar denied any wrongdoing and maintained that it had not engaged in any corrupt or improper activities within the European Parliament.\n\n## Defendants\n\n### Eva Kaili\n\nKaili denied the allegations against her and maintained her innocence. She claimed that she had been the victim of a \"set-up\" and that the allegations against her were part of a broader conspiracy to discredit her.\n\n### Francesco Giorgi\n\nGiorgi also denied the allegations against him and maintained his innocence. He claimed that he had been a victim of circumstance and that the allegations against him were part of a broader pattern of behavior by the European Parliament's authorities.\n\n### Luca Visentini\n\nVisentini denied the allegations against him and maintained his innocence.

The bridge, which spans the Kerch Strait, was a vital supply route for Russian forces in Ukraine and a symbol of Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014.\n\n#Background\n\nThe Crimean Bridge, also known as the Kerch Strait Bridge, was opened in 2018 by Russian President Vladimir Putin. The 19-kilometer-long bridge was constructed at a cost of over $3.6 billion and was designed to facilitate the transportation of goods and people between the Russian mainland and the Crimean Peninsula. The bridge was also seen as a strategic move by Russia to solidify its control over Crimea, which was annexed in 2014 following a disputed referendum.\n\nIn the years leading up to the explosion, the Crimean Bridge had become a critical supply route for Russian forces in Ukraine, particularly during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. The bridge was used to transport troops, equipment, and supplies to Russian forces in southern Ukraine.\n\n#Event\n\nOn October 8, 2022, at around 6:00 a.m. local time, a massive explosion occurred on the Crimean Bridge. The explosion, which was reportedly caused by a truck bomb, damaged a significant portion of the bridge's roadway and caused a massive fire. The explosion also damaged a nearby railway bridge, which was used to transport goods and people.\n\nThe exact circumstances surrounding the explosion are still unclear, but it is believed that the explosion was caused by a deliberate act of sabotage. Ukrainian officials have denied any involvement in the explosion, while Russian officials have pointed the finger at Ukraine.\n\n#Immediate Impact\n\nThe immediate impact of the explosion was significant. The bridge was closed to traffic, and all rail traffic was suspended. The explosion also caused significant disruptions to Russian military operations in Ukraine, as the bridge was a critical supply route for Russian forces.\n\nIn the aftermath of the explosion, Russian authorities launched a major investigation into the incident. The investigation, which was led by the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB), was tasked with determining the cause of the explosion and identifying those responsible.\n\n#Structural Damage to the Bridges\n\nThe explosion caused significant structural damage to the Crimean Bridge. The bridge's roadway was severely damaged, and several sections of the bridge were destroyed. The nearby railway bridge was also damaged, although the extent of the damage is still unclear.\n\nIn the days following the explosion, Russian authorities worked to assess the damage to the bridge and to develop a plan to repair it. The repairs, which were expected to take several months to complete, were seen as a major priority for Russian authorities.\n\n#Reaction\n\n##Ukrainian\n\nUkrainian officials denied any involvement in the explosion, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stating that Ukraine was not responsible for the incident. Ukrainian officials also pointed out that the explosion was a clear example of the risks associated with Russia's continued occupation of Crimea.\n\n##Russian\n\nRussian officials were quick to point the finger at Ukraine, with Russian President Vladimir Putin stating that the explosion was a \"terrorist attack\" carried out by Ukraine. Russian officials also vowed to take action against those responsible for the explosion.\n\n##International\n\nThe international community was quick to condemn the explosion, with many countries calling for a thorough investigation into the incident. The United States, the European Union, and other countries issued statements expressing concern about the explosion and its implications for regional stability.\n\n#Aftermath\n\n##Effect on Russian Forces\n\nThe explosion had a significant impact on Russian military operations in Ukraine. The bridge was a critical supply route for Russian forces, and its closure caused significant disruptions to Russian military operations. Russian forces were forced to rely on alternative supply routes, which were seen as more vulnerable to attack.\n\n##Effect on Russian Government\n\nThe explosion also had a significant impact on the Russian government. The incident was seen as a major embarrassment for Russian authorities, who had touted the Crimean Bridge as a symbol of Russia's strength and resilience. The incident also raised questions about the security of Russian infrastructure and the ability of Russian authorities to protect critical assets.\n\n#Investigation\n\nThe investigation into the explosion was led by the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB). The investigation, which was launched in the aftermath of the explosion, was tasked with determining the cause of the explosion and identifying those responsible.\n\nIn the days following the explosion, Russian authorities announced that they had identified several suspects in connection with the incident. The suspects, who were reportedly Ukrainian nationals, were accused of carrying out the explosion on behalf of the Ukrainian government.\n\n#See also\n\n* Crimean Bridge\n* Kerch Strait\n* 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation\n\n#References\n\n*Note: This article does not include references or citations.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Crimean_Bridge_explosion\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Event\n#Immediate impact\n#Structural damage to the bridges\n#Reaction\n##Ukrainian\n##Russian\n##International\n#Aftermath\n##Effect on Russian forces\n##Effect on Russian government\n#Investigation\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

From the earliest pre-Roman inhabitants to the present day, the county has played a significant role in the development of the region and the country as a whole. This article provides an overview of the history of County Durham, from the earliest times to the present day.\n\n# Roman and pre-Roman\n\nThe earliest known human presence in County Durham dates back to the Mesolithic period, around 8000 BC. Archaeological evidence suggests that the area was inhabited by hunter-gatherer communities, who exploited the natural resources of the land. As the Neolithic period began, around 4000 BC, farming communities began to establish themselves in the area, bringing with them new technologies and ways of life.\n\nThe Bronze Age, which began around 2500 BC, saw the development of more complex societies in the area, with the construction of burial mounds and other monumental architecture. The Iron Age, which began around 750 BC, saw the emergence of the Celtic-speaking Brigantes tribe, who inhabited much of northern England, including County Durham.\n\n# Anglo-Saxon\n\n## Anglian Kingdom of Bernicia\n\nIn the 5th century AD, the Angles, a Germanic tribe, began to settle in the area, establishing the Kingdom of Bernicia. The kingdom stretched from the Humber Estuary in the south to the Forth Estuary in the north, and from the Pennines in the west to the North Sea in the east. The kingdom was ruled by a series of kings, including Ida, who is said to have founded the city of Bamburgh, and Æthelfrith, who expanded the kingdom's borders through a series of military campaigns.\n\n## Kingdom of Northumbria\n\nIn the 7th century, the Kingdom of Bernicia merged with the Kingdom of Deira to form the Kingdom of Northumbria. The kingdom was a major power in Anglo-Saxon England, and played a significant role in the development of the country's culture, politics, and economy. The kingdom was ruled by a series of kings, including Edwin, who converted to Christianity, and Oswald, who was canonized as a saint.\n\n# City of Durham founded\n\nIn 995, the city of Durham was founded by a group of monks from Lindisfarne, who were fleeing the Viking invasions. The city was established on a peninsula of high land, surrounded by the River Wear, and was named after the Celtic saint, Cuthbert. The city quickly became an important center of trade, commerce, and learning, and was granted a charter by King Canute in 1018.\n\n# Norman and Anglo-Norman\n\nIn 1066, the Norman Conquest of England took place, and County Durham was one of the first areas to be affected. The county was granted to William de St-Calais, a Norman nobleman, who became the Bishop of Durham and the Earl of Northumbria. The Normans introduced feudalism to the area, and established a new system of government, based on the manorial system.\n\n# County Palatine of Durham\n\nIn the 12th century, the County Palatine of Durham was established, with the Bishop of Durham as the Count Palatine. The County Palatine was a unique form of government, in which the bishop had secular powers, as well as ecclesiastical authority. The county was ruled by a series of bishops, including Hugh de Puiset, who built Durham Castle, and Richard Poore, who founded the University of Oxford.\n\n## Early administration\n\n### Boundaries, exclaves and population\n\nThe County Palatine of Durham had a complex system of boundaries, with several exclaves and enclaves. The county was bounded by the River Tees to the south, the North Sea to the east, and the Pennines to the west. The population of the county was concentrated in the valleys of the River Wear and the River Tees, and was largely rural.\n\n### Survey\n\nIn the 13th century, a survey of the county was conducted, which provided valuable information about the population, economy, and government of the area. The survey showed that the county was divided into several hundred townships, each with its own lord and manorial system.\n\n### Palatinate\n\nThe County Palatine of Durham was a unique form of government, in which the bishop had secular powers, as well as ecclesiastical authority. The bishop was responsible for the administration of justice, the collection of taxes, and the defense of the county.\n\n### Wars\n\nThe County Palatine of Durham played a significant role in several wars, including the Wars of the Roses and the English Civil War. The county was a key location for the armies of the north, and was the site of several major battles.\n\n### Parliamentary representation and secular powers\n\nIn the 14th century, the County Palatine of Durham was granted parliamentary representation, with two members of parliament representing the county. The bishop's secular powers were gradually eroded, and by the 16th century, the county was governed by a lord lieutenant, appointed by the monarch.\n\n# Later government\n\nIn the 17th century, the County Palatine of Durham was abolished, and the county was governed by a lord lieutenant, appointed by the monarch. The county was divided into several hundred townships, each with its own lord and manorial system.\n\n# Eighteenth century\n\nIn the 18th century, the county underwent significant changes, with the development of the coal and iron industries. The population of the county grew rapidly, and the county became a major center of industry and commerce.\n\n# Nineteenth century\n\nIn the 19th century, the county underwent further changes, with the development of the railways and the growth of the shipbuilding industry. The population of the county continued to grow, and the county became a major center of industry and commerce.\n\n# Twentieth century\n\nIn the 20th century, the county underwent significant changes, with the decline of the coal and shipbuilding industries. The population of the county declined, and the county became a major center of tourism and leisure.\n\n# Political history\n\nThe county has a long and complex political history, with the County Palatine of Durham playing a significant role in several wars, including the Wars of the Roses and the English Civil War.

The deal was announced on March 19, 2023, and marked one of the largest bank takeovers in history. This article provides an overview of the events leading up to the acquisition, the negotiations, the acquisition itself, and the subsequent reactions and impact.\n\n# Background\n\n## Credit Suisse and the 2007–2008 financial crisis\n\nCredit Suisse, one of Switzerland's largest banks, had faced significant challenges in the years leading up to the acquisition. The bank had struggled to recover from the losses incurred during the 2007–2008 financial crisis, which had a devastating impact on the global banking sector. Credit Suisse had invested heavily in subprime mortgage-backed securities, which became worthless during the crisis, resulting in massive losses for the bank. The bank's reputation and financial stability were severely damaged, and it faced intense scrutiny from regulators and investors.\n\n## Losses in investment banking arm\n\nIn the years following the financial crisis, Credit Suisse's investment banking arm continued to struggle, posting significant losses. The bank's attempts to revive its investment banking business were unsuccessful, and it became clear that a major overhaul was needed. In 2022, Credit Suisse announced a major restructuring plan, which included significant job cuts and a refocusing of the bank's activities. However, the plan failed to yield the desired results, and the bank's financial woes continued.\n\n## March 2023 United States bank failures and contagion\n\nIn March 2023, the United States banking sector was rocked by the failures of several major banks, including Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. The failures sent shockwaves through the global financial system, leading to a loss of confidence in the banking sector. Credit Suisse, which had significant exposure to the US banking sector, was particularly vulnerable to the contagion. The bank's stock price plummeted, and its credit rating was downgraded, making it increasingly difficult for the bank to access funding.\n\n# Negotiations\n\nIn the days following the US bank failures, Credit Suisse's situation became increasingly desperate. The bank's management team, led by CEO Ulrich Körner, began exploring options for a potential sale or merger. UBS, Switzerland's largest bank, emerged as a potential suitor, and negotiations between the two banks began in earnest. The talks were reportedly tense and complex, with both sides seeking to secure the best possible deal.\n\n# Acquisition\n\nOn March 19, 2023, UBS announced that it had agreed to acquire Credit Suisse in an all-share deal worth approximately CHF 3 billion (USD 3.2 billion). The acquisition would create one of the largest banks in the world, with assets of over CHF 1.5 trillion (USD 1.6 trillion). The deal was subject to regulatory approval and was expected to be completed by the end of 2023.\n\n## Reactions\n\nThe acquisition was met with a mixed reaction from investors, analysts, and regulators. Some praised the deal as a necessary step to stabilize the global banking system, while others expressed concerns about the potential risks and challenges associated with integrating the two banks.\n\n### AT1 bonds issue\n\nOne of the most contentious issues surrounding the acquisition was the treatment of Credit Suisse's Additional Tier 1 (AT1) bonds. AT1 bonds are a type of hybrid bond that can be converted into equity in the event of a bank's financial distress. Credit Suisse's AT1 bondholders were concerned that the acquisition would result in a significant loss of value for their investments. UBS ultimately agreed to honor the AT1 bonds, but the issue remained a source of controversy.\n\n### Sale price issue\n\nSome analysts questioned the sale price of the acquisition, arguing that UBS had overpaid for Credit Suisse's assets. The sale price of CHF 3 billion was seen as relatively low compared to Credit Suisse's book value, leading some to speculate that UBS had secured a good deal.\n\n### Lawsuits\n\nIn the weeks following the acquisition, several lawsuits were filed against UBS and Credit Suisse by investors and AT1 bondholders. The lawsuits alleged that the banks had misled investors about the financial health of Credit Suisse and the terms of the acquisition.\n\n# Impact\n\nThe acquisition of Credit Suisse by UBS is expected to have significant implications for the global banking sector. The deal is likely to lead to increased consolidation in the industry, as smaller banks seek to merge with larger rivals to remain competitive. The acquisition also highlights the importance of regulatory oversight and the need for banks to maintain strong financial buffers to withstand periods of market turmoil.\n\n# See also\n\n* Credit Suisse\n* UBS\n* 2007–2008 financial crisis\n* Banking sector\n* Mergers and acquisitions\n* Regulatory oversight", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Acquisition_of_Credit_Suisse_by_UBS\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Credit Suisse and the 2007–2008 financial crisis\n##Losses in investment banking arm\n##March 2023 United States bank failures and contagion\n#Negotiations\n#Acquisition\n##Reactions\n###AT1 bonds issue\n###Sale price issue\n###Lawsuits\n#Impact\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The main event of the evening saw Roman Reigns defending his Undisputed WWE Universal Championship against Sami Zayn, who had been building a rivalry with Reigns for several months.

The visit was part of a larger tour of Asia, which included stops in Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea. Pelosi's trip to Taiwan was seen as a significant event in the complex and sensitive relations between the United States, Taiwan, and the People's Republic of China (PRC).\n\n#Background\n\nNancy Pelosi had been planning to visit Taiwan since April 2022, but the trip was postponed due to COVID-19 concerns. The visit was rescheduled for August 2022, amidst rising tensions between the United States and China. The PRC has long considered Taiwan a part of its territory, and any official visits by foreign dignitaries are seen as a challenge to its sovereignty claims. The United States has a long-standing policy of strategic ambiguity towards Taiwan, which includes maintaining unofficial relations with the island while avoiding any actions that could be seen as recognizing Taiwan as a sovereign state.\n\n#Visit\n\nPelosi's visit to Taiwan began on August 2, 2022, when she arrived at Taipei's Songshan Airport. She was greeted by Taiwanese Foreign Minister Joseph Wu and other senior officials. During her visit, Pelosi met with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen and other top officials, including the Speaker of the Legislative Yuan, You Si-kun. The meetings focused on a range of issues, including economic cooperation, security, and human rights.\n\nPelosi also delivered a speech at the Legislative Yuan, in which she praised Taiwan's democratic achievements and expressed support for the island's sovereignty. The speech was seen as a significant gesture of support for Taiwan, and was widely reported in the international media.\n\n#Reactions\n\n##United States\n\nThe visit was widely supported by members of the United States Congress, who saw it as a demonstration of American support for Taiwan. President Joe Biden's administration was more cautious, with the White House stating that the visit was a personal decision by Pelosi and that the United States remained committed to its one-China policy.\n\n##People's Republic of China\n\nThe PRC reacted strongly to Pelosi's visit, with the Chinese Foreign Ministry condemning the trip as a \"serious violation\" of China's sovereignty. China's leaders, including President Xi Jinping, issued strongly worded statements, warning the United States against \"playing with fire\" and stating that China would take \"firm and resolute measures\" to defend its sovereignty.\n\n###Hong Kong\n\nIn Hong Kong, which is a Special Administrative Region of China, the government issued a statement expressing \"strong opposition\" to Pelosi's visit. The city's Chief Executive, John Lee, stated that the visit was a \"flagrant provocation\" and that Hong Kong would \"firmly support\" China's position on Taiwan.\n\n###Sanctions\n\nIn response to Pelosi's visit, China imposed sanctions on her and her family members, including a travel ban and the freezing of assets. China also suspended imports of certain Taiwanese products, including citrus fruits and fish.\n\n##International\n\n###Intergovernmental organizations\n\nThe visit was widely reported in the international media, with many intergovernmental organizations issuing statements on the issue. The United Nations Secretary-General, António Guterres, expressed concern over the rising tensions and called for restraint.\n\n###Nations\n\nMany countries, including Australia, Canada, and the European Union, issued statements expressing concern over the situation and calling for calm. Japan, which has a complex relationship with China, issued a statement expressing \"serious concern\" over the situation and calling for restraint.\n\n#Interpretations and popular response\n\nPelosi's visit to Taiwan was widely seen as a significant event in the complex and sensitive relations between the United States, Taiwan, and China. Many analysts saw the visit as a demonstration of American support for Taiwan, and a challenge to China's sovereignty claims.\n\nIn Taiwan, the visit was widely seen as a boost to morale and a demonstration of international support. The Taiwanese public expressed strong support for the visit, with many people taking to social media to express their gratitude to Pelosi.\n\nIn China, the visit was widely condemned, with many people expressing outrage and indignation on social media. The Chinese government's response was seen as a demonstration of its commitment to defending its sovereignty, and many analysts saw the visit as a significant escalation of tensions between China and the United States.\n\n#Aftermath\n\nThe aftermath of Pelosi's visit saw a significant escalation of tensions between China and the United States. China conducted a series of military exercises near Taiwan, including missile tests and naval drills. The United States responded by deploying naval vessels to the region, including an aircraft carrier.\n\nThe visit also had significant implications for the relationship between the United States and Taiwan. Many analysts saw the visit as a demonstration of American support for Taiwan, and a significant shift in the United States' policy towards the island.\n\n#See also\n\n* Cross-Strait relations\n* One-China policy\n* Taiwan–United States relations\n* China–United States relations\n\n#Notes\n\nNote: This article is a factual account of the 2022 visit by Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan.

However, the rain was not enough to fully alleviate the drought, and many areas continued to experience dry conditions.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe August heatwave had significant impacts on various sectors and communities.\n\n### Retail\n\nThe August heatwave had a mixed impact on retail sales, with some consumers opting to stay indoors and avoid shopping, while others took advantage of the warm weather to go outdoors and shop.\n\n### Gardening\n\nThe August heatwave had a significant impact on gardening, with many plants and flowers struggling to survive in the dry conditions.
