After the war, he retired to his estates, where he was accused of committing a series of heinous crimes, including the murders of numerous children. His trial and subsequent execution have become infamous in French history.\n\n#House of Retz\n\n##Early life\n\nGilles de Rais was born in 1404 in Champtocé-sur-Loire, Anjou, to Guy de Laval and Marie de Craon. He was the eldest of four children. His family, the House of Retz, was a prominent noble family in western France. Gilles' early life was marked by luxury and privilege, and he received a classical education.\n\n##Matrimonial projects\n\nIn 1418, Gilles was betrothed to Béatrice de Rohan, but the engagement was broken off in 1420. He then married Catherine de Thouars, a wealthy heiress, in 1420. This union brought Gilles significant wealth and property, including the lordship of Retz.\n\n##Family disputes\n\nGilles' family was known for its internal conflicts and power struggles. His father, Guy de Laval, died in 1415, and his mother, Marie de Craon, remarried to Jean de Craon. Gilles' relationship with his stepfather was strained, and the two men frequently clashed over property and influence.\n\n##Titles, estates and wealth\n\nThrough his marriage to Catherine de Thouars, Gilles acquired the lordships of Retz, Champtocé, and Ingrande. He also inherited the titles of Baron de Retz and Marshal of France. Gilles' wealth and influence made him a prominent figure in western French society.\n\n#Military career\n\n##First hypothetical feat of arms\n\nGilles' military career began in 1427, when he joined the army of Charles VII, the King of France. His first recorded military engagement was the siege of Pontorson, where he allegedly distinguished himself in battle.\n\n##Franco-Breton alliance through the House of Valois-Anjou\n\nIn 1429, Gilles joined the army of Joan of Arc, who was leading a campaign to drive the English out of France. He became a close ally of Joan and participated in several battles, including the siege of Orléans.\n\n##Guerilla warfare against English garrisons on the borders of Maine\n\nGilles continued to fight against the English in the border regions of Maine. He employed guerilla tactics, using small groups of soldiers to harass and disrupt English supply lines.\n\n##Companion in arms with Joan of Arc\n\nGilles' relationship with Joan of Arc was close, and he became one of her trusted advisors. He fought alongside her in several battles, including the Battle of Patay.\n\n##Civil wars between La Trémoille and Richemont's allies\n\nIn 1432, Gilles became embroiled in the civil wars between the followers of La Trémoille and those of Richemont. He allied himself with La Trémoille, but the conflict ultimately led to the downfall of both men.\n\n##Lifting of the siege of Lagny\n\nIn 1432, Gilles helped to lift the siege of Lagny, a strategic town in the Île-de-France region. His military success was short-lived, however, as he was soon forced to retreat.\n\n##Reduction of military commitments\n\nBy 1435, Gilles had largely withdrawn from military life, citing financial and personal reasons. He retired to his estates, where he became increasingly reclusive.\n\n#Squandering of heritage\n\nGilles' withdrawal from public life was marked by a series of extravagant and wasteful spending sprees. He sold off many of his family's assets, including land and titles, to finance his lavish lifestyle.\n\n#Criminal life\n\n##Occult involvement\n\nGilles became increasingly interested in the occult, and he began to practice black magic. He employed a number of occultists, including a man named François Prelati, who helped him to perform rituals and incantations.\n\n##Child murders\n\nIn 1432, Gilles began to murder children, allegedly as part of his occult practices. The exact number of victims is unknown, but it is estimated that he killed between 60 and 200 children.\n\n##Act of force in Saint-Étienne-de-Mer-Morte\n\nIn 1433, Gilles committed an act of violence in the town of Saint-Étienne-de-Mer-Morte, where he attacked and killed several people.\n\n##Ecclesiastical and secular investigations\n\nGilles' crimes eventually came to the attention of the authorities, and he was investigated by both ecclesiastical and secular officials.\n\n##Trial and execution\n\nGilles was put on trial in 1440, where he was accused of murder, heresy, and sodomy. He was found guilty and sentenced to death. He was executed by hanging on October 26, 1440.\n\n#Question of guilt\n\n##Doubts about the verdict in the Age of Enlightenment tradition\n\nIn the 18th century, some historians began to question the verdict against Gilles, suggesting that he may have been falsely accused.\n\n##Occultist interpretations\n\nSome occultists have interpreted Gilles' crimes as part of a larger ritual or sacrifice, rather than as the actions of a serial killer.\n\n##Georges Bataille's interpretations\n\nThe French philosopher Georges Bataille wrote extensively about Gilles, interpreting his crimes as a form of transgression against societal norms.\n\n##1992 mock re-trial\n\nIn 1992, a mock re-trial of Gilles was held in France, where he was acquitted of all charges.\n\n##Contemporary academic views\n\nMost contemporary academics accept that Gilles was guilty of the crimes for which he was accused. However, some continue to question the fairness of his trial and the motivations of his accusers.\n\n#Fictional portraits\n\nGilles has been the subject of numerous fictional works, including films, books, and plays. He is often portrayed as a charismatic and complex figure, driven by a mix of motivations.\n\n#Psychopathological interpretations\n\n##Fin de siècle portrayals\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Gilles was often portrayed as a fin de siècle figure, symbolizing the decay and corruption of the aristocracy.\n\n##Classification as a serial killer\n\nGilles is often classified as a serial killer, although some academics have questioned the applicability of this term to his crimes.\n\n#Gilles de Rais and the Bluebeard myth\n\nGilles' crimes have been linked to the Bluebeard myth, which tells the story of a nobleman who murders his wives. Some academics have suggested that the Bluebeard myth may have been inspired by Gilles' crimes.\n\n#Relationship with Joan of Arc\n\nGilles' relationship with Joan of Arc remains a subject of fascination and debate. Some historians have suggested that Gilles may have been in love with Joan, while others have portrayed their relationship as purely platonic.\n\n#See also\n\n* Joan of Arc\n* Hundred Years' War\n* Serial killer\n* Occultism\n* Bluebeard\n\n#References\n\n##Notes\n\n##Footnotes\n\n##Bibliography\n\n###Historical studies and literary scholarship\n\n* Georges Bataille, The Trial of Gilles de Rais (1959)\n* Jean Benedetti, Gilles de Rais: The Life and Times of a Medieval Psychopath (1971)\n* Fernand Fleuret, Gilles de Rais (1976)\n* Robert Favreau, Gilles de Rais (1980)\n\n###Essays\n\n* Georges Bataille, \"The Accursed Share\" (1949)\n* Michel Foucault, \"The History of Sexuality\" (1976)\n\n#External links\n\n* Gilles de Rais at the Internet Archive\n* Gilles de Rais at the Online Encyclopedia of Mass Murderers", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Gilles_de_Rais\" following this outline:\n\n#House of Retz\n##Early life\n##Matrimonial projects\n##Family disputes\n##Titles, estates and wealth\n#Military career\n##First hypothetical feat of arms\n##Franco-Breton alliance through the House of Valois-Anjou\n##Guerilla warfare against English garrisons on the borders of Maine\n##Companion in arms with Joan of Arc\n##Civil wars between La Trémoille and Richemont's allies\n##Lifting of the siege of Lagny\n##Reduction of military commitments\n#Squandering of heritage\n#Criminal life\n##Occult involvement\n##Child murders\n##Act of force in Saint-Étienne-de-Mer-Morte\n##Ecclesiastical and secular investigations\n##Trial and execution\n#Question of guilt\n##Doubts about the verdict in the Age of Enlightenment tradition\n##Occultist interpretations\n##Georges Bataille's interpretations\n##1992 mock re-trial\n##Contemporary academic views\n#Fictional portraits\n#Psychopathological interpretations\n##Fin de siècle portrayals\n##Classification as a serial killer\n#Gilles de Rais and the Bluebeard myth\n#Relationship with Joan of Arc\n#See also\n#References\n##Notes\n##Footnotes\n##Bibliography\n###Historical studies and literary scholarship\n###Essays\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The election took place from January 3 to January 7, 2023, after the 2022 United States House of Representatives elections. The process involved nominations from both the Democratic Party and the Republican Party, followed by a House-wide election to determine the Speaker.\n\n# Process and conventions\n\nThe Speaker of the United States House of Representatives is elected by the members of the House of Representatives, typically at the beginning of each new Congress. The Speaker is the presiding officer of the House and is responsible for setting the legislative agenda. The Speaker is typically the leader of the majority party in the House. The process of electing a Speaker involves nominations from each party, followed by a series of ballots until a candidate receives a majority of the votes.\n\n# Democratic nomination\n\n## Candidates\n\n### Nominee\n\nHakeem Jeffries was nominated by the Democratic Party to become the Speaker of the House. Jeffries, a representative from New York, is the Chairman of the House Democratic Caucus and was widely expected to become the Speaker after the retirement of Nancy Pelosi.\n\n### Declined to run\n\nSeveral other Democrats were mentioned as potential candidates for Speaker, but ultimately declined to run. These included Representatives Adam Schiff of California, Pramila Jayapal of Washington, and Katherine Clark of Massachusetts.\n\n## Result\n\nHakeem Jeffries was unanimously nominated by the Democratic Party to become the Speaker of the House.\n\n# Republican nomination\n\n## Candidates\n\n### Nominee\n\nKevin McCarthy was nominated by the Republican Party to become the Speaker of the House. McCarthy, a representative from California, is the House Minority Leader and was widely expected to become the Speaker after the Republican Party gained control of the House.\n\n### Lost nomination\n\nSeveral other Republicans were mentioned as potential candidates for Speaker, but ultimately lost the nomination to Kevin McCarthy. These included Representatives Steve Scalise of Louisiana, Jim Jordan of Ohio, and Elise Stefanik of New York.\n\n## Results\n\nKevin McCarthy was nominated by the Republican Party to become the Speaker of the House, but ultimately lost the election due to opposition from a group of conservative Republicans.\n\n# Election of the speaker\n\n## Background\n\nThe election of the Speaker took place on January 3, 2023, with Hakeem Jeffries and Kevin McCarthy as the main candidates. However, the election was complicated by the fact that several conservative Republicans refused to support Kevin McCarthy, citing concerns about his leadership style and policy positions.\n\n## Candidates\n\nTwo candidates were nominated for Speaker: Hakeem Jeffries and Kevin McCarthy. Several other candidates also received votes, including Representatives Jim Jordan, Byron Donalds, and Kevin Hern.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe election of the Speaker took place over several days, with multiple ballots required to determine the winner. On the first ballot, Kevin McCarthy received 203 votes, while Hakeem Jeffries received 212 votes. However, McCarthy ultimately won the election on the 15th ballot, after several conservative Republicans agreed to support him.\n\n## Ballots 1–3 (January 3)\n\nThe first three ballots took place on January 3, with Kevin McCarthy receiving 203 votes on each ballot. Hakeem Jeffries received 212 votes on each ballot, with several other candidates also receiving votes.\n\n## Ballots 4–6 (January 4)\n\nThe fourth, fifth, and sixth ballots took place on January 4, with Kevin McCarthy receiving 201 votes on each ballot. Hakeem Jeffries received 212 votes on each ballot, with several other candidates also receiving votes.\n\n## Ballots 7–11 (January 5)\n\nThe seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, and eleventh ballots took place on January 5, with Kevin McCarthy receiving 201 votes on each ballot. Hakeem Jeffries received 212 votes on each ballot, with several other candidates also receiving votes.\n\n## Ballots 12–15 (January 6)\n\nThe twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth ballots took place on January 6, with Kevin McCarthy ultimately winning the election on the 15th ballot. McCarthy received 216 votes on the final ballot, while Hakeem Jeffries received 212 votes.\n\n## All ballots: votes not cast for party nominee\n\nSeveral representatives did not vote for their party's nominee on one or more ballots. These included Representatives Lauren Boebert of Colorado, Matt Gaetz of Florida, and Paul Gosar of Arizona, who all refused to support Kevin McCarthy.\n\n## All ballots: summary of votes\n\nThe following table summarizes the votes for each ballot:\n\n| Ballot | Kevin McCarthy | Hakeem Jeffries | Other candidates |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | 203 | 212 | 20 |\n| 2 | 203 | 212 | 20 |\n| 3 | 203 | 212 | 20 |\n| 4 | 201 | 212 | 22 |\n| 5 | 201 | 212 | 22 |\n| 6 | 201 | 212 | 22 |\n| 7 | 201 | 212 | 22 |\n| 8 | 201 | 212 | 22 |\n| 9 | 201 | 212 | 22 |\n| 10 | 201 | 212 | 22 |\n| 11 | 201 | 212 | 22 |\n| 12 | 214 | 212 | 9 |\n| 13 | 214 | 212 | 9 |\n| 14 | 214 | 212 | 9 |\n| 15 | 216 | 212 | 6 |\n\n# Impact\n\n## Historical context\n\nThe January 2023 Speaker of the United States House of Representatives election was one of the most contentious in recent history, with several conservative Republicans refusing to support Kevin McCarthy. The election was also notable for the fact that it took 15 ballots to determine the winner, the longest Speaker election since 1859.\n\n## Consequences while there was no speaker\n\nThe delay in electing a Speaker had several consequences, including the inability of the House to conduct business and the delay of several key legislative priorities. The delay also had implications for the Republican Party, which was seen as divided and unable to govern effectively.\n\n## C-SPAN popularity\n\nThe Speaker election was widely covered on C-SPAN, which saw a significant increase in viewership during the election. The network's coverage of the election was praised for its thoroughness and attention to detail.\n\n# See also\n\n* 2022 United States House of Representatives elections\n* 118th United States Congress\n* Speaker of the United States House of Representatives\n* Kevin McCarthy\n* Hakeem Jeffries\n\n# Notes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"January_2023_Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives_election\" following this outline:\n\n#Process and conventions\n#Democratic nomination\n##Candidates\n###Nominee\n###Declined to run\n##Result\n#Republican nomination\n##Candidates\n###Nominee\n###Lost nomination\n##Results\n#Election of the speaker\n##Background\n##Candidates\n##Summary\n##Ballots 1–3 (January 3)\n##Ballots 4–6 (January 4)\n##Ballots 7–11 (January 5)\n##Ballots 12–15 (January 6)\n##All ballots: votes not cast for party nominee\n##All ballots: summary of votes\n#Impact\n##Historical context\n##Consequences while there was no speaker\n##C-SPAN popularity\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This period saw a resurgence of interest in classical Greek and Roman art and culture, which had a profound impact on the development of sculpture in Italy. Italian Renaissance sculpture is characterized by its naturalism, humanism, and technical mastery, and is considered one of the greatest artistic achievements of the Renaissance.\n\n# Periods\n\nItalian Renaissance sculpture can be broadly divided into three periods: the Early Renaissance (14th-15th centuries), the High Renaissance (15th-16th centuries), and the Late Renaissance (16th-17th centuries). Each period saw the emergence of new styles, techniques, and artists, and was marked by significant innovations and achievements.\n\n# Materials\n\nItalian Renaissance sculptors worked with a variety of materials, each with its own unique characteristics and challenges.\n\n## Stone\n\nStone was a popular material for sculpture during the Italian Renaissance, particularly marble. Marble was prized for its beauty, durability, and ability to be carved into intricate and delicate forms. Many famous Renaissance sculptures, such as Michelangelo's David, were carved from marble.\n\n## Metal\n\nMetal was also a popular material for sculpture during the Italian Renaissance, particularly bronze. Bronze was valued for its strength, durability, and ability to be cast into intricate and complex forms. Many Renaissance sculptors, including Donatello and Giambologna, worked extensively in bronze.\n\n## Wood\n\nWood was a common material for sculpture during the Italian Renaissance, particularly for smaller works. Wood was often used for figurines, reliefs, and other decorative objects.\n\n## Terracotta\n\nTerracotta was a popular material for sculpture during the Italian Renaissance, particularly for smaller works. Terracotta was valued for its ease of use, affordability, and ability to be molded into intricate and complex forms.\n\n## Other materials\n\nOther materials used for sculpture during the Italian Renaissance included ivory, wax, and plaster. These materials were often used for smaller works or for creating models and prototypes.\n\n## Coloured sculpture\n\nDuring the Italian Renaissance, many sculptures were painted or coloured to enhance their appearance. This was particularly true for wooden and terracotta sculptures, which were often painted to create a more lifelike appearance.\n\n# Settings\n\nItalian Renaissance sculpture was often created for specific settings, such as churches, tombs, and public squares.\n\n## Churches and tombs\n\nMany Italian Renaissance sculptures were created for churches and tombs. These sculptures often depicted saints, angels, and other religious figures, and were intended to inspire devotion and contemplation.\n\n## Civic pride\n\nItalian Renaissance sculpture was also created to promote civic pride and identity. Many cities and towns commissioned sculptures to adorn their public squares and buildings, often depicting mythological or historical figures.\n\n### Fountains\n\nFountains were a popular setting for Italian Renaissance sculpture, particularly in public squares and gardens. Many famous fountains, such as the Fountain of Neptune in Florence, feature intricate and elaborate sculptures.\n\n## Portraits\n\nItalian Renaissance sculpture also included portraits, which were often created to commemorate famous individuals or to decorate public spaces.\n\n### Equestrian statues\n\nEquestrian statues were a popular form of portrait sculpture during the Italian Renaissance. These statues depicted famous individuals on horseback, often in a heroic or triumphant pose.\n\n### Shoulder busts\n\nShoulder busts were another popular form of portrait sculpture during the Italian Renaissance. These busts depicted the upper body and head of the subject, often in a realistic and detailed manner.\n\n### Medals\n\nMedals were a popular form of portrait sculpture during the Italian Renaissance, particularly for commemorative purposes. These medals often depicted famous individuals or events, and were often worn as pendants or displayed in public spaces.\n\n## Small sculpture\n\nItalian Renaissance sculpture also included small works, such as figurines, reliefs, and decorative objects. These small sculptures were often created for private collectors or for decorative purposes.\n\n# Workshops\n\nMany Italian Renaissance sculptors worked in workshops, where they trained apprentices and created sculptures for clients. These workshops were often family-run and passed down through generations.\n\n## Women sculptors\n\nWomen sculptors were relatively rare during the Italian Renaissance, but some notable examples include Sofonisba Anguissola and Properzia de' Rossi. These women often worked in male-dominated workshops and faced significant challenges in their careers.\n\n# Guilds\n\nMany Italian Renaissance sculptors belonged to guilds, which were organized groups of craftsmen and artists. These guilds often regulated the profession, set standards for quality and training, and provided support and protection for their members.\n\n# Patrons\n\nItalian Renaissance sculpture was often commissioned by wealthy patrons, who supported the arts and architecture. These patrons often included nobles, bishops, and wealthy merchants.\n\n# Development of style\n\nItalian Renaissance sculpture developed over several centuries, influenced by classical Greek and Roman art and culture.\n\n## To 1400\n\nBefore 1400, Italian sculpture was largely influenced by medieval and Byzantine styles. These early sculptures often featured flat, two-dimensional forms and a lack of naturalism.\n\n## From 1400\n\nFrom 1400 onwards, Italian sculpture began to adopt more naturalistic and humanistic forms, influenced by classical Greek and Roman art.\n\n### Doors of the Florence Baptistery\n\nThe bronze doors of the Florence Baptistery, created by Lorenzo Ghiberti, are considered a key work in the development of Italian Renaissance sculpture. These doors feature intricate and naturalistic reliefs, and demonstrate a mastery of technique and composition.\n\n### Donatello\n\nDonatello was a key figure in the development of Italian Renaissance sculpture, known for his innovative and expressive works. His sculptures often featured dynamic and emotive forms, and explored new techniques and materials.\n\n### Middle of the century\n\nBy the middle of the 15th century, Italian Renaissance sculpture had reached a high level of technical mastery and artistic expression. Many famous sculptors, including Michelangelo and Giambologna, emerged during this period.\n\n### Lombardy\n\nLombardy, a region in northern Italy, was an important center for Renaissance sculpture. Many famous sculptors, including Cristoforo Mantegazza and Andrea Mantegna, worked in Lombardy and developed a distinctive style.\n\n### Crisis of the 1490s\n\nThe 1490s saw a crisis in Italian Renaissance sculpture, as many artists and patrons fled Florence due to the French invasion. This period saw a decline in artistic production and a shift in styles and techniques.\n\n## 16th century\n\nThe 16th century saw a resurgence of interest in classical Greek and Roman art and culture, which had a profound impact on Italian Renaissance sculpture.\n\n### Michelangelo\n\nMichelangelo was a dominant figure in Italian Renaissance sculpture, known for his technical mastery and artistic expression. His sculptures often featured dynamic and emotive forms, and explored new techniques and materials.\n\n### Mannerist and Late Renaissance sculpture\n\nBy the mid-16th century, Italian Renaissance sculpture had begun to adopt Mannerist and Late Renaissance styles, characterized by elongated forms and a sense of tension and drama.\n\n### Giambologna\n\nGiambologna was a key figure in the development of Mannerist sculpture, known for his elegant and refined works. His sculptures often featured complex and intricate forms, and explored new techniques and materials.\n\n# Italians abroad\n\nMany Italian Renaissance sculptors worked abroad, particularly in Europe and the Mediterranean. These sculptors often brought Italian styles and techniques to new regions, and had a profound impact on local art and culture.\n\n# Notes\n\nItalian Renaissance sculpture is a rich and complex field, with many notable artists, styles, and techniques. This article provides a brief overview of the subject, but there is much more to explore and discover.\n\n# References\n\n(No references included)\n\n# External links\n\n(No external links included)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Italian_Renaissance_sculpture\" following this outline:\n\n#Periods\n#Materials\n##Stone\n##Metal\n##Wood\n##Terracotta\n##Other materials\n##Coloured sculpture\n#Settings\n##Churches and tombs\n##Civic pride\n###Fountains\n##Portraits\n###Equestrian statues\n###Shoulder busts\n###Medals\n##Small sculpture\n#Workshops\n##Women sculptors\n#Guilds\n#Patrons\n#Development of style\n##To 1400\n##From 1400\n###Doors of the Florence Baptistery\n###Donatello\n###Middle of the century\n###Lombardy\n###Crisis of the 1490s\n##16th century\n###Michelangelo\n###Mannerist and Late Renaissance sculpture\n###Giambologna\n#Italians abroad\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

From its humble beginnings as a Jewish sect in the 1st century to its current status as a global faith, Christianity has undergone numerous transformations, shaped by various social, cultural, and historical contexts. This article provides an overview of the major events, developments, and trends in the history of Christianity.\n\n**Early Christianity**\n\n### **Jewish background**\n\nChristianity originated in the 1st century as a Jewish sect, with Jesus of Nazareth as its central figure. Jesus' teachings, death, and resurrection were seen as the fulfillment of Jewish scripture and the realization of God's promise to restore Israel. The early Christian community, led by Jesus' disciples, saw themselves as part of the broader Jewish tradition, while also developing distinct beliefs and practices.\n\n### **Apostolic Age (c. 30–100)**\n\n#### **Developing church structure**\n\nAs the early Christian community grew, it developed a more formal structure. The apostles, who were seen as Jesus' closest followers, played a key role in shaping the church's leadership and doctrine. The Jerusalem church, led by James, the brother of Jesus, was the center of the early Christian movement.\n\n#### **Early growth**\n\nChristianity spread rapidly throughout the Mediterranean world, particularly among Jewish communities. The apostle Paul, a former Pharisee, became a key figure in the spread of Christianity, preaching to Gentiles (non-Jews) and establishing churches in various cities.\n\n## **Ante-Nicene period (100–312)**\n\n### **Scripture**\n\nThe early Christian community developed a set of scriptures, which would eventually become the New Testament. The process of canonization, or the establishment of the authoritative texts, took several centuries. The earliest Christian writings, such as the letters of Paul, were seen as authoritative, while other texts, like the Gospel of Thomas, were eventually rejected.\n\n### **Early Christian art**\n\nEarly Christian art, which emerged in the 2nd century, was characterized by simple, symbolic representations of Christian themes. The use of art in worship and decoration became more widespread, reflecting the growing importance of visual expression in Christian piety.\n\n### **Persecutions and legalization**\n\nChristians faced periodic persecutions from Roman authorities, who saw the new faith as a threat to traditional values and the state. The most severe persecution occurred during the reign of Emperor Diocletian (303-313 CE). However, with the conversion of Emperor Constantine in 312 CE, Christianity was legalized, and the church began to receive imperial support.\n\n## **Spread of Christianity to c. 300 AD**\n\n### **Inclusivity, women and exclusivity**\n\nEarly Christianity was characterized by a degree of inclusivity, with women playing a significant role in the church. However, as the church grew and became more institutionalized, women's roles became more limited. The church also began to develop a more exclusive identity, distinguishing itself from other Jewish and pagan groups.\n\n### **Moral practices**\n\nEarly Christian communities developed distinct moral practices, such as the rejection of idolatry, the importance of charity, and the emphasis on forgiveness. These practices were seen as essential to the Christian way of life and were often used to distinguish Christians from others.\n\n**Late antiquity (313–476)**\n\n## **Conversion of Constantine**\n\n### **Christianity and the state**\n\nThe conversion of Emperor Constantine in 312 CE marked a significant turning point in the history of Christianity. Constantine's support for the church led to the establishment of Christianity as a state-sponsored religion, with the church receiving significant financial and political backing.\n\n### **Christianity and polytheism**\n\nAs Christianity spread, it encountered various forms of polytheism, including the traditional Roman pantheon. Christian missionaries and theologians developed strategies for engaging with and converting polytheists, often using existing cultural and philosophical frameworks to articulate Christian doctrine.\n\n## **Augustine's ethic toward Jews**\n\nThe theologian Augustine of Hippo (354-430 CE) developed a complex and influential ethic toward Jews. While Augustine rejected anti-Jewish violence and persecution, he also saw Jews as being in a state of spiritual blindness, requiring Christian mission and conversion.\n\n## **Developing orthodoxy and heresy**\n\nAs the church grew, it faced various theological challenges and controversies. The development of orthodoxy, or correct doctrine, was a gradual process, with various councils and theologians contributing to the articulation of Christian teaching. Heresy, or false doctrine, was seen as a threat to the unity and integrity of the church.\n\n## **Church of the East**\n\nThe Church of the East, also known as the Assyrian Church, emerged in the 2nd century and developed a distinct theology and liturgy. The church played a significant role in the spread of Christianity in the Middle East and Central Asia.\n\n## **Hospitals**\n\nThe establishment of hospitals, particularly in the Eastern Roman Empire, marked a significant development in Christian social care. Hospitals provided medical care, food, and shelter to the poor and the sick, reflecting the church's commitment to charity and compassion.\n\n## **Art and literature**\n\nThe late antique period saw significant developments in Christian art and literature. The use of mosaics, icons, and other forms of visual art became more widespread, while writers like Augustine and Jerome made significant contributions to Christian theology and literature.\n\n## **Spread and growth of Christianity**\n\nChristianity continued to spread throughout the Mediterranean world, with significant growth in the Eastern Roman Empire. The church also began to establish itself in various parts of Europe, including Gaul (modern-day France) and Britain.\n\n### **Christianity in the Roman Africa province**\n\nThe Roman province of Africa, which included modern-day Tunisia, Algeria, and parts of Libya, was an important center of early Christianity. The church in Africa played a significant role in the development of Christian theology and practice.\n\n### **German Europe, Britain and Ireland**\n\nChristianity was introduced to German Europe, Britain, and Ireland by various missionaries, including Saint Patrick (c. 385-461 CE). The church established itself in these regions, with significant growth and development in the following centuries.\n\n### **Asia**\n\nChristianity spread to various parts of Asia, including Persia (modern-day Iran), India, and China. The church established itself in these regions, often through the efforts of missionaries and traders.\n\n**Early Middle Ages (476–842)**\n\n## **Justinian I**\n\nThe Byzantine Emperor Justinian I (527-565 CE) played a significant role in the development of Christian law and theology. Justinian's Codex, a comprehensive collection of Roman law, had a lasting impact on Western legal systems.\n\n## **Education**\n\nThe early Middle Ages saw significant developments in Christian education. The establishment of monasteries and schools, such as the monastery of St. Gall (founded c. 613 CE), provided opportunities for education and learning.\n\n## **Law**\n\nThe development of Christian law, particularly in the Byzantine Empire, reflected the church's growing influence on society. The use of canon law, which governed the church's internal affairs, became more widespread.\n\n## **Monasticism**\n\nMonasticism, which emerged in the 3rd century, became a significant aspect of Christian spirituality. Monasteries provided opportunities for prayer, study, and work, while also serving as centers of learning and culture.\n\n## **Art**\n\nThe early Middle Ages saw significant developments in Christian art, particularly in the Byzantine Empire. The use of icons, mosaics, and other forms of visual art became more widespread, reflecting the church's growing emphasis on visual expression.\n\n## **Papal supremacy**\n\nThe papacy, which emerged in the 5th century, became a central institution in the Western Christian church. The pope's claim to supremacy, based on the apostolic succession, was gradually recognized by other churches.\n\n## **Spread and growth of Christianity**\n\nChristianity continued to spread throughout Europe, with significant growth in the Frankish kingdom (modern-day France and Germany). The church also established itself in various parts of Asia, including China and India.\n\n**High Middle Ages (842–1299)**\n\n## **Christendom 842-1099**\n\n### **Tenth and eleventh century reform**\n\nThe 10th and 11th centuries saw significant reform movements within the church, particularly in the monastic and clerical orders. The reformers sought to restore the church's spiritual vitality and combat corruption.\n\n### **Investiture controversy (1078)**\n\nThe investiture controversy, which pitted the papacy against the Holy Roman Emperor, marked a significant turning point in the history of Christianity. The controversy centered on the issue of who had the authority to appoint bishops.\n\n### **Toledo 1085**\n\nThe capture of Toledo by Christian forces in 1085 CE marked a significant turning point in the Reconquista, the Christian reconquest of the Iberian Peninsula.\n\n### **First crusade (1095)**\n\nThe First Crusade, launched in 1095 CE, marked a significant turning point in Christian history. The crusade, which sought to retake Jerusalem from Muslim control, had far-reaching consequences for Christian-Muslim relations.\n\n### **Learning and change**\n\nThe High Middle Ages saw significant developments in Christian learning and culture.

The election was triggered by the resignation of Liz Truss as leader of the Conservative Party and Prime Minister.\n\n#Background\n\n##Boris Johnson premiership and scandals\n\nBoris Johnson had been Prime Minister of the United Kingdom since July 2019, leading a Conservative minority government. However, his premiership was marred by several scandals, including the Partygate scandal, which involved Johnson and other government officials attending parties at 10 Downing Street during the COVID-19 pandemic, despite strict lockdown rules being in place. The scandal led to widespread criticism and calls for Johnson's resignation.\n\n##Leadership election to succeed Johnson\n\nIn July 2022, Johnson announced his resignation as leader of the Conservative Party, triggering a leadership election to succeed him. The election was contested by several candidates, including Liz Truss, who was then the Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs, and Rishi Sunak, who was then the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Truss ultimately won the election, defeating Sunak in the final round of voting.\n\n##Liz Truss premiership and scandals\n\nTruss became Prime Minister on September 6, 2022, but her premiership was short-lived and marred by controversy. Her government's mini-budget, announced on September 23, 2022, included several tax cuts and other measures that were widely criticized as being too radical and potentially destabilizing to the economy. The budget led to a sharp decline in the value of the pound and an increase in government borrowing costs.\n\n##Calls for Truss's resignation\n\nAs the controversy over the mini-budget grew, calls for Truss's resignation began to mount. Several Conservative MPs publicly criticized the government's economic policies, and some even called for Truss to step down. The opposition Labour Party also called for Truss to resign, arguing that she was no longer fit to be Prime Minister.\n\n##Resignations and vote on fracking\n\nOn October 14, 2022, Truss's Home Secretary, Suella Braverman, resigned after just 45 days in the job, citing concerns over the government's immigration policies. The same day, the government announced that it would hold a vote on lifting the ban on fracking, despite opposition from many Conservative MPs. The vote was seen as a test of Truss's authority, and her government ultimately lost the vote.\n\n##Liz Truss resigns\n\nOn October 25, 2022, Truss announced her resignation as leader of the Conservative Party and Prime Minister, just 49 days after taking office. Her resignation triggered a new leadership election, which was contested by several candidates.\n\n#Campaign\n\nThe campaign for the October 2022 Conservative Party leadership election was marked by a series of debates and hustings, in which the candidates set out their policies and visions for the future of the party and the country. The debates were widely covered in the media, and helped to shape public opinion about the candidates.\n\n#Election process\n\nThe election process was overseen by the Conservative Party's board, which set out the rules and timeline for the election. The election was contested by Conservative MPs, who voted in a series of rounds to select their preferred candidate. The candidate with the fewest votes in each round was eliminated, until only one candidate remained.\n\n#Candidates\n\n##Declared\n\nSeveral candidates declared their intention to stand in the election, including:\n\n* Rishi Sunak, who had come second in the previous leadership election\n* Penny Mordaunt, who was then the Leader of the House of Commons\n* Suella Braverman, who had recently resigned as Home Secretary\n* Kemi Badenoch, who was then the Minister of State for Equalities\n* Jeremy Hunt, who was then the Chancellor of the Exchequer\n\n##Withdrawn\n\nSeveral candidates withdrew from the election during the campaign, including:\n\n* Suella Braverman, who withdrew on October 24, 2022\n* Jeremy Hunt, who withdrew on October 24, 2022\n\n##Explored\n\nSeveral candidates explored standing in the election, but ultimately decided not to, including:\n\n* Ben Wallace, who was then the Secretary of State for Defence\n* Sajid Javid, who was then the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care\n\n##Declined\n\nSeveral candidates declined to stand in the election, including:\n\n* Michael Gove, who was then the Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities\n* Dominic Raab, who was then the Deputy Prime Minister\n\n#Endorsements\n\nSeveral candidates received endorsements from other Conservative MPs, including:\n\n* Rishi Sunak, who was endorsed by several senior Conservative MPs, including Oliver Dowden and Robert Jenrick\n* Penny Mordaunt, who was endorsed by several Conservative MPs, including Damian Green and Chris Philp\n\n#Responses\n\nThe election was widely covered in the media, and sparked a range of responses from politicians and commentators. The opposition Labour Party called for a general election, arguing that the Conservative Party was no longer fit to govern.\n\n#Polling\n\nSeveral polls were conducted during the campaign, which provided insight into public opinion about the candidates and the election.\n\n##Conservative members\n\nA poll of Conservative Party members found that Rishi Sunak was the most popular candidate, followed by Penny Mordaunt.\n\n##2019 Conservative voters\n\nA poll of voters who had supported the Conservative Party in the 2019 general election found that Rishi Sunak was the most popular candidate, followed by Penny Mordaunt.\n\n##General population\n\nA poll of the general population found that the majority of respondents believed that the Conservative Party was no longer fit to govern, and that a general election should be held as soon as possible.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"October_2022_Conservative_Party_leadership_election\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Boris Johnson premiership and scandals\n##Leadership election to succeed Johnson\n##Liz Truss premiership and scandals\n##Calls for Truss's resignation\n##Resignations and vote on fracking\n##Liz Truss resigns\n#Campaign\n#Election process\n#Candidates\n##Declared\n##Withdrawn\n##Explored\n##Declined\n#Endorsements\n#Responses\n#Polling\n##Conservative members\n##2019 Conservative voters\n##General population\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The novel is a sprawling, postmodern epic that explores the intersection of art, politics, and history in the 20th century. It is considered one of the most important and influential works of German literature since World War II.\n\nPlot\n-----\n\nThe novel is structured around the experiences of a group of young people in Berlin in the 1930s, who gather to discuss art, politics, and philosophy. As the story unfolds, the narrative expands to encompass a wide range of historical and cultural references, including the rise of fascism, the Spanish Civil War, and the development of modern art movements such as Surrealism and Abstract Expressionism.\n\nThrough the characters' discussions and debates, Weiss explores the ways in which art can be used to resist oppressive regimes and challenge dominant ideologies. At the same time, the novel raises questions about the limitations and contradictions of artistic resistance, and the ways in which art can be co-opted or compromised by the very systems it seeks to challenge.\n\nForm features and structure\n---------------------------\n\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance is characterized by its innovative and experimental form, which blends elements of fiction, essay, and historical narrative.

He was also concerned about the novel's length and complexity, and worried that it would be too challenging for readers.\n\n### The third volume\n\nThe third volume of the novel was published in 1981, several years after the first two volumes. Weiss had originally planned to conclude the novel with the second volume, but he became increasingly obsessed with the project and continued to work on it for several more years.\n\n### Sweden and the GDR\n\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance was first published in Sweden, where Weiss had lived in exile during the 1960s and 1970s.

Their spiritual practices and beliefs, collectively known as Lakota religion, are deeply rooted in their cultural heritage and ancestral traditions. This article provides an overview of the Lakota people's spiritual beliefs, practices, and history.\n\n# Definition and Classification\n\nLakota religion is a complex and multifaceted system of spiritual practices and beliefs that are unique to the Lakota people. It is often classified as a form of Native American spirituality or Indigenous spirituality, which encompasses the spiritual practices and beliefs of Native American communities. Lakota religion is characterized by its emphasis on animism, kinship with nature, and the sacred hoop, which represents the interconnectedness of all living beings.\n\n# Beliefs\n\n## Wakʽą and Wakʽą Tʽąką\n\nIn Lakota spirituality, Wakʽą (also spelled Wakan) refers to the divine or the sacred. It is the mysterious, transcendent power that pervades all of existence. Wakʽą is often translated as \"holy\" or \"sacred,\" but its meaning is more nuanced and complex. Wakʽą Tʽąką, on the other hand, refers to the sacred beings or spirits that inhabit the world. These spirits can take many forms, including animals, plants, and natural elements.\n\n## Wakʽąpi\n\nThe Wakʽąpi are the spirits that inhabit the world. They are believed to possess supernatural powers and are often associated with specific animals, plants, or natural elements. The Wakʽąpi are thought to be the guardians of the natural world and are revered for their wisdom and power.\n\n## Cosmogony\n\nLakota cosmogony tells the story of the creation of the world and the origins of the Lakota people. According to legend, the world was created by the Wakʽąpi, who brought forth the land, the animals, and the people. The story of creation is often told through oral tradition and is an important part of Lakota spiritual practices.\n\n## Spirit and Afterlife\n\nIn Lakota spirituality, the spirit is believed to continue after death, and the afterlife is thought to be a continuation of life on earth. The spirits of the dead are believed to inhabit the spirit world, where they continue to play an active role in the lives of the living. The Lakota people believe that the spirits of the dead can communicate with the living through various means, including dreams and visions.\n\n## Animism and Kinship\n\nLakota spirituality is deeply rooted in animism, which is the belief that all living beings possess a spiritual essence or soul. The Lakota people believe that all living beings are interconnected and that humans are not separate from nature. This belief is reflected in their kinship system, which is based on the idea of shared ancestry and shared responsibility for the natural world.\n\n### Šicųpi and wašicu\n\nŠicųpi (also spelled shicunpi) refers to the Lakota people's relationship with the natural world. It is a concept that encompasses their spiritual, cultural, and practical connections to the land and its inhabitants. Wašicu, on the other hand, refers to the Lakota people's relationship with non-Native Americans. The term is often translated as \"foreigner\" or \"non-Native,\" but its meaning is more complex and nuanced.\n\n## Cosmology and the Sacred Hoop\n\nLakota cosmology is based on the concept of the sacred hoop, which represents the interconnectedness of all living beings. The sacred hoop is a symbol of the unity and wholeness of the natural world and is often depicted as a circle or a hoop. The Lakota people believe that all living beings are part of the sacred hoop and that their actions have consequences for the entire web of life.\n\n## Morality and Gender Roles\n\nLakota morality is based on the principles of respect, reciprocity, and responsibility. The Lakota people believe that all living beings have inherent value and deserve to be treated with respect and dignity. Gender roles in Lakota society are complex and nuanced, and both men and women play important roles in spiritual and cultural practices.\n\n# Practices\n\n## Prayer and Offerings\n\nPrayer is an essential part of Lakota spirituality, and the Lakota people believe that prayer is a powerful means of communicating with the spirits. Offerings are often made to the spirits, including food, tobacco, and other sacred objects.\n\n### Suffering and Sacrifice\n\nSuffering and sacrifice are important themes in Lakota spirituality. The Lakota people believe that suffering can be a means of purification and that sacrifice is a way of showing respect and gratitude to the spirits.\n\n## The Sacred Pipe\n\nThe sacred pipe is a central part of Lakota spirituality and is used in many ceremonies and rituals. The pipe is believed to be a powerful symbol of the connection between the physical and spiritual worlds.\n\n## Sweat Lodge\n\nThe sweat lodge is a sacred space used for purification and spiritual renewal. The Lakota people believe that the sweat lodge is a means of communicating with the spirits and of purifying the body and mind.\n\n## Vision Quest\n\nThe vision quest is a rite of passage in which young men and women seek to establish a connection with the spirits. The quest involves fasting, prayer, and solitude, and is often accompanied by visions and dreams.\n\n## Sun Dance\n\nThe sun dance is a sacred ceremony in which the Lakota people honor the spirits and the natural world. The dance involves singing, dancing, and offerings to the spirits.\n\n## Further Rites\n\nThe Lakota people have many other spiritual practices and ceremonies, including the ghost dance, the grass dance, and the powwow.\n\n## Healing and Cursing\n\nThe Lakota people believe that spiritual powers can be used for healing and cursing. Healing is often performed through rituals and ceremonies, while cursing is often used to protect the community from harm.\n\n## Holy Men\n\nHoly men play an important role in Lakota spirituality, serving as spiritual leaders and guides. They are often responsible for leading ceremonies and rituals and for interpreting the will of the spirits.\n\n### Yuwípi and yuwípi wičháša\n\nYuwípi refers to the Lakota people's spiritual practices and ceremonies, while yuwípi wičháša refers to the spiritual leaders who lead these practices.\n\n### Other specialists\n\nThe Lakota people have many other spiritual specialists, including healers, singers, and dancers.

The image was released to the public and quickly went viral, sparking widespread media coverage and public reaction.\n\n#Background\n\nThe mug shot was taken as part of the booking process after Trump was indicted by a grand jury on charges related to his alleged attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results in Georgia. The indictment was the result of a lengthy investigation led by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, who had been examining Trump's actions in the state following the election.\n\nTrump had been summoned to appear in court on August 24, 2023, where he was formally booked and released on his own recognizance. As part of the booking process, Trump was required to have his photograph taken, which is standard procedure for all individuals who are booked into the jail.\n\n#Usage\n\nThe mug shot of Donald Trump has been widely used in various contexts, including fundraising and news coverage.\n\n##Fundraising\n\nThe mug shot has been used by various Democratic organizations and campaigns as a fundraising tool.

The image has also been used in television news broadcasts, with many networks displaying the mug shot on screen during segments about Trump's case.\n\nSome news outlets have used the mug shot in a more creative way, such as by Photoshopping it onto other images or using it as part of a larger graphic. For example, the New York Daily News published a front-page image featuring the mug shot, with the headline \"TRUMP'S NEW PROFILE PICTURE\" in bold letters.\n\n#Reactions\n\nThe release of the mug shot has sparked a wide range of reactions, both from Trump supporters and detractors.\n\nSome Trump supporters have defended the former president, arguing that the indictment and booking were politically motivated.

The term \"Sun Belt\" was first coined in the 1960s to describe the region's warm and sunny climate, which was seen as a major draw for tourists, retirees, and businesses looking to relocate from colder climates. Today, the Sun Belt is one of the fastest-growing regions in the United States, with a diverse economy, a growing population, and a unique cultural identity.\n\n#Migration\n\nThe Sun Belt has experienced significant migration patterns over the years, with people moving to the region for a variety of reasons. One of the primary drivers of migration to the Sun Belt has been the region's warm and sunny climate, which has made it a popular destination for retirees and \"snowbirds\" (people who migrate to warmer climates during the winter months). The region's growing economy and job market have also attracted migrants, particularly in the fields of technology, healthcare, and tourism.\n\n##Rural-urban migration\n\nIn addition to migration from other parts of the country, the Sun Belt has also experienced significant rural-urban migration. Many rural areas in the South have experienced declining populations and economic stagnation, leading to a migration of people to urban areas in search of better job opportunities and higher living standards. This migration has contributed to the growth of cities in the Sun Belt, such as Atlanta, Miami, and Phoenix.\n\n##International migration\n\nThe Sun Belt has also experienced significant international migration, particularly from Latin America and the Caribbean. The region's proximity to the border with Mexico and its cultural and economic ties to the region have made it a popular destination for immigrants from Latin America. The Sun Belt is also home to a large number of immigrants from the Caribbean, particularly from Cuba, Haiti, and Jamaica.\n\n#Definition\n\nThe Sun Belt is generally defined as the region in the southern United States that includes the states of Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia. The region is bounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the east, the Gulf of Mexico to the south, and the Rocky Mountains to the west.\n\n##Sub-regions\n\nWithin the Sun Belt, there are several sub-regions that are defined by their unique cultural, economic, and geographic characteristics. These sub-regions include:\n\n* The Southeastern United States, which includes the states of Alabama, Georgia, Florida, and the Carolinas.\n* The Southwestern United States, which includes the states of Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas.\n* The Gulf Coast, which includes the states of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama.\n\n#Projections\n\nThe Sun Belt is projected to continue growing and developing in the coming years, with significant implications for the region's economy, population, and environment. Some of the key projections for the Sun Belt include:\n\n* Continued population growth, with the region's population projected to increase by over 20% by 2030.\n* Economic growth, with the region's GDP projected to increase by over 30% by 2030.\n* Increased urbanization, with the region's cities projected to continue growing and developing.\n* Increased environmental pressures, particularly in the areas of water management and climate change.\n\n##Demographic projections\n\nThe Sun Belt is projected to experience significant demographic changes in the coming years, including:\n\n* An aging population, with the region's population projected to become older and more diverse.\n* Increased diversity, with the region's population projected to become more Hispanic and Asian.\n* Changes in household structure, with the region's population projected to become more likely to live in single-person households.\n\n#Politics\n\nThe Sun Belt has a unique political landscape, with a diverse range of perspectives and ideologies. The region has historically been a stronghold for the Republican Party, but in recent years, there has been a shift towards the Democratic Party, particularly in urban areas.\n\n##Voting patterns\n\nThe Sun Belt has a complex voting pattern, with different regions and demographics voting in different ways. For example:\n\n* The Southeastern United States tends to vote Republican, particularly in rural areas.\n* The Southwestern United States tends to vote Democratic, particularly in urban areas.\n* The Gulf Coast tends to vote Republican, particularly in areas with high levels of military presence.\n\n##Policy issues\n\nThe Sun Belt has a range of policy issues that are unique to the region, including:\n\n* Immigration, particularly in areas with high levels of international migration.\n* Economic development, particularly in areas with high levels of poverty and unemployment.\n* Environmental policy, particularly in areas with high levels of environmental degradation.\n\n#Environment\n\nThe Sun Belt is home to a diverse range of environmental ecosystems, including deserts, forests, and wetlands. The region is also home to a range of environmental challenges, including climate change, water management, and pollution.\n\n##Climate change\n\nThe Sun Belt is particularly vulnerable to climate change, with rising temperatures and changing weather patterns having significant impacts on the region's ecosystems and human populations. Some of the key climate change impacts on the Sun Belt include:\n\n* Increased heat stress, particularly in urban areas.\n* Changes in precipitation patterns, particularly in areas with high levels of agriculture.\n* Increased risk of natural disasters, particularly hurricanes and droughts.\n\n##Water management\n\nThe Sun Belt is home to a range of water management challenges, particularly in areas with high levels of population growth and urbanization. Some of the key water management challenges on the Sun Belt include:\n\n* Water scarcity, particularly in areas with high levels of agriculture.\n* Water quality, particularly in areas with high levels of pollution.\n* Flood management, particularly in areas with high levels of precipitation.\n\n#Major cities\n\nThe Sun Belt is home to a range of major cities, each with its own unique cultural, economic, and environmental characteristics. Some of the key major cities in the Sun Belt include:\n\n* Atlanta, Georgia: a major hub for business and finance.\n* Miami, Florida: a major hub for international trade and tourism.\n* Phoenix, Arizona: a major hub for technology and innovation.\n* Houston, Texas: a major hub for energy and healthcare.\n* Charlotte, North Carolina: a major hub for finance and banking.\n\n#See also\n\n* Southern United States\n* Southwestern United States\n* Gulf Coast\n* Sun Belt Conference\n* Snowbelt\n\n#References\n\n* (List of sources used to research this article)\n\n#Further reading\n\n* (List of suggested further reading for those interested in learning more about the Sun Belt)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Sun_Belt\" following this outline:\n\n#Migration\n#Definition\n#Projections\n#Politics\n#Environment\n#Major cities\n#See also\n#References\n#Further reading\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The city's law enforcement agencies have worked to combat these activities, but the ever-evolving nature of organized crime has made it a persistent challenge.\n\n#Early History\n\n##Bank Robbers\n\nDuring the late 19th and early 20th centuries, London experienced a series of bank robberies carried out by notorious outlaws such as Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. These robberies often involved violence and intimidation, and law enforcement agencies struggled to keep up with the perpetrators.\n\n##Motorcycle Clubs\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, motorcycle clubs began to emerge in London, with groups such as the Hells Angels and the Outlaws establishing chapters in the city. These clubs were often associated with organized crime, and their members were involved in various illicit activities such as extortion, loan-sharking, and narcotics trafficking.\n\n#Major Events\n\n##History of the London Klan\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) established a chapter in London, Ontario.

This conflict, known as the Ontario Biker War, resulted in numerous deaths and injuries, and law enforcement agencies struggled to keep up with the violence.\n\n##London Conflict\n\nIn the 2000s, a series of violent conflicts broke out between rival street gangs in London, including the EOA (East Of Adelaide) and the FU Crew.

It was the seventh election to the Assembly since the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. The election was won by Sinn Féin, who became the largest party for the first time, while the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) lost their position as the largest unionist party.\n\n#Background\n\n## Electoral events\n\nThe previous Northern Ireland Assembly election was held in 2017, in which the DUP won 28 seats and Sinn Féin won 27 seats. The 2017 election was called after the DUP's First Minister, Arlene Foster, refused to resign over a scandal surrounding a green energy scheme. The election resulted in the DUP and Sinn Féin being unable to form a power-sharing executive, leading to a three-year period of direct rule from London.\n\n## Leadership changes\n\nIn 2021, Edwin Poots was elected as the new leader of the DUP, replacing Jeffrey Donaldson. However, Poots resigned after just 21 days as leader, and Donaldson returned to the role. In Sinn Féin, Michelle O'Neill remained as deputy First Minister, while Mary Lou McDonald served as party president.\n\n## Northern Ireland Protocol\n\nThe Northern Ireland Protocol, part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement, became a major issue in the election. The protocol created a customs border in the Irish Sea, which unionists argued undermined Northern Ireland's position within the United Kingdom. Nationalists, on the other hand, argued that the protocol protected the Good Friday Agreement and prevented a hard border on the island of Ireland.\n\n## Calls for early election\n\nIn February 2022, the DUP's Paul Givan resigned as First Minister, collapsing the power-sharing executive. Sinn Féin's Michelle O'Neill refused to re-enter the executive unless the DUP agreed to implement the Northern Ireland Protocol. The DUP refused, leading to calls for an early election.\n\n#Candidates\n\nA total of 239 candidates stood in the election, representing 15 parties. The DUP and Sinn Féin stood in all 18 constituencies, while the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) stood in 17 and 16 constituencies, respectively. The Alliance Party and Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) stood in 17 and 19 constituencies, respectively.\n\n#Members not seeking re-election\n\nSeveral high-profile MLAs did not stand for re-election, including the DUP's Nelson McCausland and Sinn Féin's Gerry Kelly. The UUP's Robbie Butler also did not stand, citing personal reasons.\n\n#Campaign\n\nThe campaign focused largely on the Northern Ireland Protocol and the future of the power-sharing executive. The DUP campaigned on a platform of opposing the protocol, while Sinn Féin argued that it was essential for protecting the Good Friday Agreement. The Alliance Party and SDLP focused on issues such as healthcare and education.\n\n#Opinion polls\n\nOpinion polls suggested that Sinn Féin would become the largest party, with the DUP losing ground. A LucidTalk poll in April 2022 put Sinn Féin on 26.6%, followed by the DUP on 20.1%. The Alliance Party was on 14.5%, while the UUP was on 12.2%.\n\n#Results\n\n## Distribution of seats by constituency\n\nThe results saw Sinn Féin win 27 seats, followed by the DUP on 25 seats. The Alliance Party won 17 seats, while the UUP won 9 seats. The SDLP won 8 seats, while the TUV won 1 seat.\n\n## Share of first-preference votes\n\nSinn Féin won 29% of first-preference votes, followed by the DUP on 21.3%. The Alliance Party won 13.5% of first-preference votes, while the UUP won 11.2%. The SDLP won 9.1% of first-preference votes.\n\n## Incumbents defeated\n\nSeveral high-profile MLAs lost their seats, including the DUP's Emma Little-Pengelly and Sinn Féin's John O'Dowd. The UUP's Robbie Butler was also defeated, as was the SDLP's Nichola Mallon.\n\n#Aftermath\n\nThe results led to Sinn Féin's Michelle O'Neill becoming the First Minister of Northern Ireland for the first time. The DUP's Jeffrey Donaldson became the deputy First Minister, despite his party's opposition to the Northern Ireland Protocol. The results were seen as a significant shift in the balance of power in Northern Ireland, with nationalists and unionists evenly split.\n\n#See also\n\n* 2022 United Kingdom local elections\n* Northern Ireland Assembly\n* Good Friday Agreement\n* Brexit and the Irish border\n\n#Footnotes\n\n* This article uses British English spelling and terminology.\n\n#External links\n\n* Northern Ireland Assembly election 2022 (BBC News)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Northern_Ireland_Assembly_election\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Electoral events\n##Leadership changes\n##Northern Ireland Protocol\n##Calls for early election\n#Candidates\n#Members not seeking re-election\n#Campaign\n#Opinion polls\n#Results\n##Distribution of seats by constituency\n##Share of first-preference votes\n##Incumbents defeated\n#Aftermath\n#See also\n#Footnotes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

These storms have the potential to bring catastrophic damage and loss of life, particularly in coastal communities. In 2022, numerous tropical cyclones formed across various ocean basins, resulting in significant impacts on affected regions. This article provides an overview of the global atmospheric and hydrological conditions that influenced tropical cyclone activity in 2022, as well as a summary of the storms that occurred in each ocean basin.\n\n# Global atmospheric and hydrological conditions\n\nThe 2022 tropical cyclone season was influenced by several global atmospheric and hydrological conditions. One of the most significant factors was the ongoing La Niña event, which had a profound impact on tropical cyclone activity in the Pacific Ocean. La Niña is a natural climate phenomenon characterized by cooler-than-average sea surface temperatures in the eastern Pacific, which can lead to increased hurricane activity in the Atlantic and decreased activity in the Pacific.\n\nAnother important factor was the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), which is a climate pattern that affects the Indian Ocean and surrounding regions. The IOD has a significant impact on tropical cyclone activity in the Indian Ocean and can also influence the monsoon season in India.\n\n# Summary\n\nThe 2022 tropical cyclone season was marked by above-average activity in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, while the Pacific Ocean experienced below-average activity. In total, 143 tropical cyclones formed across the globe, resulting in 67 reported deaths and over $10 billion in damages.\n\n## North Atlantic Ocean\n\nThe 2022 Atlantic hurricane season was above-average, with 19 named storms, 10 hurricanes, and 5 major hurricanes. The most notable storm of the season was Hurricane Ida, which made landfall in Louisiana as a Category 4 hurricane, causing widespread damage and flooding.\n\n## Eastern & Central Pacific Ocean\n\nThe 2022 Eastern Pacific hurricane season was below-average, with 13 named storms, 4 hurricanes, and 2 major hurricanes.

He was best known as a member of the hip hop trio Migos, alongside Quavo and Offset.\n\n# Early life\n\nTakeoff was born on June 18, 1994, in Lawrenceville, Georgia. He grew up in a musical family and was exposed to hip hop at a young age. His uncle, Quavo, was also a rapper and would later become his group member and collaborator. Takeoff's early life was marked by a strong passion for music, and he began rapping in his teenage years.\n\n# Career\n\nTakeoff's career in music began in the late 2000s, and he quickly gained recognition as a member of Migos.\n\n## 2008–2018: Early work with Migos\n\nTakeoff co-founded Migos in 2008 with his uncle Quavo and cousin Offset. The group's early work was marked by a distinctive style that blended hip hop with elements of trap and cloud rap. Takeoff's verse on the group's 2013 single \"Versace\" helped establish him as a rising star in the hip hop world. The song's success led to Migos signing with Quality Control Music and 300 Entertainment.\n\nIn the following years, Takeoff continued to release music with Migos, including the critically acclaimed album \"Culture\" in 2017. The album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart and featured the hit single \"Bad and Boujee.\" Takeoff's verse on the song was widely praised, and he became known for his unique flow and lyrical style.\n\n## 2018–2021: The Last Rocket and later Migos work\n\nIn 2018, Takeoff released his debut solo album, \"The Last Rocket.\" The album received positive reviews from critics and debuted at number four on the US Billboard 200 chart. The album featured the singles \"Last Memory\" and \"Infatuation,\" and showcased Takeoff's growth as a solo artist.\n\nIn the following years, Takeoff continued to release music with Migos, including the albums \"Culture II\" and \"Culture III.\" The group's popularity continued to grow, and they became one of the most successful hip hop groups of the 2010s.\n\n## 2022: Friction within Migos and Only Built for Infinity Links\n\nIn 2022, tensions within Migos became public, with Offset and Takeoff reportedly at odds over creative differences. The group's future was uncertain, and it was unclear if they would continue to make music together.\n\nDespite the uncertainty surrounding Migos, Takeoff continued to work on solo music. In August 2022, he announced that he would be releasing a new album, \"Only Built for Infinity Links,\" in collaboration with Quavo. The album was released on October 7, 2022, and debuted at number seven on the US Billboard 200 chart.\n\n# Legal issues\n\nTakeoff was involved in several high-profile legal issues throughout his career.\n\n## Georgia Southern University incident\n\nIn 2015, Takeoff was involved in a incident at Georgia Southern University, where Migos was scheduled to perform. The incident reportedly began when a group of students attempted to rush the stage, and Takeoff and other members of Migos' entourage responded with violence. Takeoff was charged with possession of a firearm on school property and was later sentenced to 12 months' probation.\n\n## Sexual assault allegations\n\nIn 2020, Takeoff was accused of sexual assault by a woman who claimed that he had attacked her at a party in Los Angeles. Takeoff denied the allegations, and the case was later dropped due to a lack of evidence.\n\n# Murder and trial\n\nTakeoff was shot and killed on November 1, 2022, outside a bowling alley in Houston, Texas. He was 28 years old at the time of his death.\n\n## Reactions\n\nTakeoff's death was met with an outpouring of tributes and condolences from the hip hop community. Quavo, Offset, and other members of Migos' inner circle were devastated by the news, and many took to social media to pay their respects.\n\n## Investigation and legal proceedings\n\nThe investigation into Takeoff's death is ongoing, and it is unclear if anyone will be charged in connection with his murder. The Houston Police Department has released several statements regarding the investigation, but few details have been made public.\n\n## Funeral\n\nTakeoff's funeral was held on November 11, 2022, at the State Farm Arena in Atlanta, Georgia. The service was attended by thousands of fans and members of the hip hop community, and featured performances by Quavo, Offset, and other artists.\n\n## Commercial impact\n\nTakeoff's death had a significant impact on the music industry, with many of his songs and albums experiencing a surge in popularity in the days and weeks following his death. His solo album \"The Last Rocket\" re-entered the US Billboard 200 chart, and several of his songs with Migos reached new heights on the charts.\n\n# Discography\n\n* \"The Last Rocket\" (2018)\n* \"Only Built for Infinity Links\" (2022)\n\n# See also\n\n* Migos\n* Quavo\n* Offset\n\n# Notes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Takeoff_(rapper)\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n#Career\n##2008–2018: Early work with Migos\n##2018–2021: The Last Rocket and later Migos work\n##2022: Friction within Migos and Only Built for Infinity Links\n#Legal issues\n##Georgia Southern University incident\n##Sexual assault allegations\n#Murder and trial\n##Reactions\n##Investigation and legal proceedings\n##Funeral\n##Commercial impact\n#Discography\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The procedure is commonly performed to treat cataracts, which are a clouding of the lens in the eye that can cause vision loss. The surgery is usually performed on an outpatient basis and is relatively painless.\n\n# Uses\n\nCataract surgery is used to treat cataracts, which can cause a range of vision problems, including blurry vision, double vision, and sensitivity to light. The surgery can also be used to treat other eye conditions, such as glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration. In addition, cataract surgery can be used to improve vision in people who have undergone previous eye surgeries, such as LASIK.\n\n# Techniques\n\nThere are several techniques that can be used to perform cataract surgery, including phacoemulsification, manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS), and extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE). The choice of technique depends on the individual patient's needs and the surgeon's preference.\n\n## Pre-operative evaluation\n\nBefore undergoing cataract surgery, patients will typically undergo a pre-operative evaluation to determine the best course of treatment. This evaluation may include a comprehensive eye exam, including a visual acuity test, a refraction test, and a slit-lamp examination.\n\n### Contraindications\n\nThere are several contraindications for cataract surgery, including active eye infections, severe dry eye, and certain medical conditions, such as uncontrolled diabetes or high blood pressure.\n\n### Selection of intraocular lenses\n\nIntraocular lenses (IOLs) are used to replace the natural lens in the eye. There are several types of IOLs available, including monofocal, multifocal, and toric lenses. The choice of IOL depends on the individual patient's needs and preferences.\n\n# Operation procedures\n\nThe cataract surgery procedure typically involves several steps, including preparation, anesthesia, and the removal and replacement of the lens.\n\n## Preparation\n\nBefore the surgery, the patient's eye will be cleaned and prepared with antiseptic solution. The patient will also be given a local anesthetic to numb the eye.\n\n## Anaesthesia\n\nThere are several types of anesthesia that can be used for cataract surgery, including local anesthesia, topical anesthesia, and general anesthesia. The choice of anesthesia depends on the individual patient's needs and preferences.\n\n## Phacoemulsification\n\nPhacoemulsification is a type of cataract surgery that uses ultrasonic waves to break up the lens in the eye. The lens is then removed through a small incision in the cornea.\n\n## Manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS)\n\nMSICS is a type of cataract surgery that involves making a small incision in the cornea and then removing the lens through the incision.\n\n## Extracapsular cataract extraction\n\nExtracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE) is a type of cataract surgery that involves making a larger incision in the cornea and then removing the lens through the incision.\n\n## Converting to ECCE to manage a contingency\n\nIn some cases, the surgeon may need to convert to ECCE to manage a contingency, such as a broken lens or a tear in the retina.\n\n## Closing the wound\n\nAfter the lens has been removed and replaced, the incision will be closed with sutures or a special type of glue.\n\n# Post-operative care\n\nAfter the surgery, the patient will need to follow a post-operative care plan to ensure proper healing and minimize the risk of complications.\n\n# Complications\n\nThere are several complications that can occur during and after cataract surgery, including infection, bleeding, and retinal detachment.\n\n## During surgery\n\nThere are several complications that can occur during cataract surgery, including a torn retina, a broken lens, and a dropped nucleus.\n\n## After surgery\n\nThere are several complications that can occur after cataract surgery, including infection, inflammation, and dry eye.\n\n## Risk\n\nThe risk of complications from cataract surgery is relatively low, but it can vary depending on the individual patient's needs and the surgeon's experience.\n\n# Recovery and rehabilitation\n\nThe recovery time for cataract surgery is typically several weeks, during which time the patient will need to follow a rehabilitation plan to ensure proper healing and minimize the risk of complications.\n\n# Outcomes\n\nThe outcomes of cataract surgery are typically excellent, with most patients experiencing significant improvements in vision.\n\n# History\n\nCataract surgery has a long history, dating back thousands of years. The first recorded cataract surgery was performed in ancient India in the 5th century BC.\n\n# Accessibility\n\nCataract surgery is widely available in many parts of the world, but access can be limited in some areas due to lack of healthcare resources and economic constraints.\n\n## Europe\n\nCataract surgery is widely available in Europe, with many countries having well-established healthcare systems and high-quality eye care services.\n\n## Asia\n\nCataract surgery is also widely available in Asia, with many countries having rapidly developing healthcare systems and increasing access to eye care services.\n\n## Africa\n\nAccess to cataract surgery is limited in many parts of Africa, due to lack of healthcare resources and economic constraints.\n\n## Latin America\n\nCataract surgery is available in many parts of Latin America, but access can be limited in some areas due to economic constraints and lack of healthcare resources.\n\n# Social, economic and environmental relevance\n\nCataract surgery has significant social, economic, and environmental relevance, as it can improve quality of life, reduce healthcare costs, and promote economic development.\n\n# Special populations\n\nThere are several special populations that may require special consideration when it comes to cataract surgery, including children, older adults, and people with certain medical conditions.\n\n## Congenital cataracts\n\nCongenital cataracts are a type of cataract that is present at birth. Surgery is usually necessary to treat congenital cataracts.\n\n## Higher risk for operations on separate occasions\n\nThere is a higher risk of complications when performing cataract surgery on separate occasions, such as when one eye is operated on at a time.\n\n# Other animals\n\nCataract surgery can also be performed on other animals, including dogs, cats, and horses.\n\n# See also\n\n* Cataract\n* Glaucoma\n* Age-related macular degeneration\n* LASIK\n\n# Notes\n\nNote: This article is intended to provide general information and is not a substitute for medical advice.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Cataract_surgery\" following this outline:\n\n#Uses\n#Techniques\n#Pre-operative evaluation\n##Contraindications\n##Selection of intraocular lenses\n#Operation procedures\n##Preparation\n##Anaesthesia\n##Phacoemulsification\n##Manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS)\n##Extracapsular cataract extraction\n##Converting to ECCE to manage a contingency\n##Closing the wound\n#Post-operative care\n#Complications\n##During surgery\n##After surgery\n##Risk\n#Recovery and rehabilitation\n#Outcomes\n#History\n#Accessibility\n##Europe\n##Asia\n##Africa\n##Latin America\n#Social, economic and environmental relevance\n#Special populations\n##Congenital cataracts\n##Higher risk for operations on separate occasions\n#Other animals\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Founded in the late 19th century, the company has a long history of providing construction services to various sectors, including commercial, industrial, and residential. Over the years, the company has undergone significant changes, expanding its operations and diversifying its services.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\n### Main contractor\n\nShepherd Building Group's origins date back to the late 19th century when it was founded as a small construction company in the north of England. Initially, the company focused on providing construction services to local clients, gradually expanding its operations to other parts of the country. In the mid-20th century, the company underwent significant growth, becoming a major player in the UK construction industry. During this period, Shepherd Building Group established itself as a reputable main contractor, taking on large-scale construction projects across various sectors.\n\n### Manufactured products\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, Shepherd Building Group began to diversify its operations by manufacturing construction-related products. The company established a range of manufacturing facilities, producing goods such as pre-fabricated building components, roofing materials, and insulation products. This move into manufacturing allowed Shepherd Building Group to expand its services, providing clients with a comprehensive range of construction solutions.\n\n### Disposal of non-core businesses\n\nIn the 1990s and 2000s, Shepherd Building Group underwent significant restructuring, disposing of several non-core businesses. The company sold off its manufacturing operations, focusing instead on its core construction services. This strategic move allowed Shepherd Building Group to streamline its operations, concentrating on its main areas of expertise.\n\nNotable construction projects\n-----------------------------\n\nShepherd Building Group has been involved in numerous high-profile construction projects across the UK. Some notable examples include:\n\n* The redevelopment of the Liverpool One shopping complex in Liverpool\n* The construction of the Trinity Walk shopping center in Wakefield\n* The refurbishment of the historic York Minster cathedral\n* The building of the award-winning Explore@Bristol science center in Bristol\n\nControversies\n-------------\n\n### Identity behind anonymous emails\n\nIn 2012, Shepherd Building Group was involved in a controversy surrounding anonymous emails sent to local residents in Wakefield, protesting the company's plans to build a new shopping center in the city. The emails, which were sent from an anonymous account, contained abusive language and personal attacks on local council members who supported the development. An investigation by local authorities failed to identify the sender, but many speculated that the emails were linked to Shepherd Building Group or its affiliates.\n\n### Hand tool vibration\n\nIn 2007, Shepherd Building Group was fined £150,000 by the UK's Health and Safety Executive (HSE) for failing to properly monitor and control hand tool vibration on one of its construction sites. The HSE found that the company had not taken adequate steps to prevent workers from developing hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS), a condition caused by prolonged exposure to vibrating hand tools.\n\n### Domain name disputes\n\nIn 2015, Shepherd Building Group was involved in a dispute over the ownership of the domain name \"shepherdbuildinggroup.co.uk\". The company claimed that the domain name, which was registered by a third party, was an infringement on its trademark rights. However, the domain name owner argued that the registration was legitimate, as it was not being used for commercial purposes.\n\n### Employment blacklisting\n\nIn 2013, Shepherd Building Group was named in a parliamentary report as one of several construction companies involved in the blacklisting of workers in the UK construction industry. The report found that the company had used a secret database to vet potential employees, excluding workers who had been involved in trade union activities or had raised health and safety concerns.\n\n### Trinity Walk\n\nIn 2011, Shepherd Building Group was involved in a dispute with local residents and traders over the construction of the Trinity Walk shopping center in Wakefield. The company had been contracted to build the center, but local opponents argued that the development would harm the local economy and cause traffic congestion. The dispute led to several protests and a judicial review of the planning permission granted to the development.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Construction industry in the United Kingdom\n* List of construction companies in the United Kingdom\n* Blacklisting in the construction industry", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Shepherd_Building_Group\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Main contractor\n##Manufactured products\n##Disposal of non core businesses\n#Notable construction projects\n#Controversies\n##Identity behind anonymous emails\n##Hand tool vibration\n##Domain name disputes\n##Employment blacklisting\n##Trinity Walk\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The black market played a significant role in the lives of the French population, with many individuals relying on it to access basic necessities such as food, clothing, and fuel. This article will explore the background, origins, and evolution of the black market in wartime France, as well as its impact on the population and the responses of the authorities.\n\n# Background\n\n## 1930s: inflation, instability and unrest\n\nThe 1930s in France were marked by economic instability, inflation, and social unrest. The global economic crisis of the 1930s had a significant impact on France, leading to high levels of unemployment and widespread poverty. The French government responded to the crisis by implementing a series of austerity measures, including reducing public spending and increasing taxes. However, these measures only served to exacerbate the economic situation, leading to widespread discontent among the population.\n\n## Fall of France\n\nIn May 1940, Germany launched a surprise attack on France, leading to the rapid collapse of the French military. The French government, led by Marshal Philippe Pétain, signed an armistice with Germany on June 22, 1940, which effectively divided France into two zones: the occupied zone, under direct German control, and the unoccupied zone, also known as Vichy France, which was subject to German influence but maintained a degree of autonomy.\n\n# 1940-1941\n\n## Origins\n\n### Rationing and price controls\n\nIn the aftermath of the armistice, the French government introduced a system of rationing and price controls in an attempt to manage the severe shortages of food, fuel, and other essential goods. However, these measures only served to create a thriving black market, as individuals sought to circumvent the restrictions and access the goods they needed.\n\n### Diversion from official channels\n\nAs the occupation continued, it became increasingly clear that the official channels for distributing goods were being diverted, either through corruption or inefficiency. This created a situation in which goods were being siphoned off into the black market, further exacerbating the shortages.\n\n### Clandestine networks\n\nIn response to the shortages and rationing, clandestine networks of suppliers and distributors began to emerge. These networks, often involving farmers, traders, and small-scale manufacturers, sought to bypass the official channels and supply the population with the goods they needed.\n\n### Hidden stockpiling\n\nAs the occupation continued, individuals and businesses began to stockpile goods in anticipation of future shortages. This hidden stockpiling further reduced the availability of goods in the official market, driving up prices and fueling the black market.\n\n### Grey market\n\nThe grey market, also known as the \"marché gris,\" emerged as a semi-legal alternative to the black market. The grey market involved the sale of goods at prices higher than the official prices, but lower than those found on the black market.\n\n## Users of the black market\n\n### Privileged French\n\nThe black market was not only used by those in need, but also by those who were privileged and had the means to afford the higher prices. Many members of the French elite, including politicians, business leaders, and high-ranking military officers, used the black market to access luxury goods and other scarce items.\n\n### Occupation forces\n\nThe German occupation forces also made use of the black market, often using it to acquire goods and supplies that were not available through official channels. This created a situation in which the occupation forces were effectively colluding with the black market, further undermining the legitimacy of the French government.\n\n## Public response\n\n### Early condemnation\n\nInitially, the black market was widely condemned by the French population, who saw it as a threat to the social and economic order. Many people viewed the black market as a form of collaboration with the occupation forces, and those who used it were often stigmatized.\n\n### Participation\n\nHowever, as the occupation continued and the shortages worsened, more and more people began to participate in the black market. This participation was often driven by necessity, as individuals sought to access the goods they needed to survive.\n\n### Housewives' demonstrations\n\nIn 1941, a series of demonstrations by housewives took place in several cities across France, protesting the shortages and high prices. These demonstrations were often focused on the black market, with the protesters demanding that the government take action to address the issue.\n\n### Suspicions of hoarding\n\nAs the occupation continued, suspicions of hoarding and speculation grew, with many people believing that the black market was being fueled by individuals who were deliberately withholding goods from the market.\n\n### Official antisemitism\n\nThe French government, which was increasingly influenced by antisemitic ideology, began to blame the black market on Jewish speculators and profiteers. This official antisemitism served to further stigmatize the black market and those who used it.\n\n### Public opinion\n\nDespite the official condemnation of the black market, public opinion remained divided. Many people saw the black market as a necessary evil, a way to access the goods they needed in a time of severe shortages.\n\n### Political opposition\n\nThe black market also became a focus of opposition to the French government, with many critics arguing that the government's policies were exacerbating the shortages and fueling the black market.\n\n## Response by authorities\n\nThe French government responded to the black market with a series of measures, including increased policing and surveillance, as well as the introduction of new regulations and laws. However, these measures often served to drive the black market further underground, making it even more difficult to control.\n\n# Widespread black market (autumn 1941 to 1943)\n\n## Agricultural black market\n\nThe agricultural black market emerged as a major component of the overall black market, with farmers and traders seeking to bypass the official channels and sell their goods directly to consumers.\n\n## Grey market: direct sales\n\nThe grey market, which had emerged as a semi-legal alternative to the black market, began to involve direct sales between producers and consumers. This direct sales model further reduced the availability of goods in the official market, driving up prices and fueling the black market.\n\n## Commerce and industry\n\nThe black market also began to involve commerce and industry, with businesses seeking to acquire the goods and supplies they needed to operate. This created a situation in which the black market was effectively driving the economy, with many businesses relying on it to access the goods they needed.\n\n## Tacit tolerance\n\nAs the occupation continued, the authorities began to exhibit a tacit tolerance of the black market. This tolerance was driven by a recognition that the black market was providing a necessary function, allowing individuals and businesses to access the goods they needed in a time of severe shortages.\n\n### No longer immoral\n\nThe black market was no longer seen as an immoral or unpatriotic activity, but rather as a necessary evil. This shift in perception was driven by the widespread participation in the black market, as well as the recognition that it was providing a vital function.\n\n### Nuanced and refocused enforcement\n\nThe authorities began to adopt a more nuanced and refocused approach to enforcement, targeting the most egregious forms of black market activity while tolerating the more minor infractions.\n\n## Metrics\n\n### Proportion of production\n\nEstimates suggest that by 1942, up to 50% of agricultural production was being diverted into the black market.\n\n### Higher and more volatile prices\n\nPrices on the black market were significantly higher and more volatile than those in the official market, with prices fluctuating wildly in response to changes in supply and demand.\n\n### Geographic distribution\n\nThe black market was not limited to urban areas, but was also present in rural areas, where farmers and traders were seeking to bypass the official channels and sell their goods directly to consumers.\n\n### Beneficiaries\n\nThe black market benefited a wide range of individuals and groups, including farmers, traders, manufacturers, and consumers. However, it also created a situation in which the most vulnerable members of society, including the poor and the elderly, were often priced out of the market.\n\n# Patriotism (spring 1943-summer 1944)\n\n## Enforcement for the occupiers\n\nAs the occupation continued, the authorities began to focus on enforcing the regulations and laws that benefited the occupation forces. This created a situation in which the black market was effectively seen as a threat to the occupation, with the authorities seeking to suppress it in order to maintain control.\n\n### Economic pillage and the end of the German black market\n\nThe German occupation forces began to engage in economic pillage, seeking to extract as many resources as possible from the French economy. This created a situation in which the black market was effectively seen as a threat to the German war effort, with the authorities seeking to suppress it in order to maintain control.\n\n### Countermeasures and collaboration\n\nThe French authorities, which were increasingly collaborationist, began to implement countermeasures to suppress the black market. However, these countermeasures often served to drive the black market further underground, making it even more difficult to control.\n\n### Milice vs the black market\n\nThe Milice, a French paramilitary organization that was closely aligned with the German occupation forces, began to target the black market, seeking to suppress it in order to maintain control.\n\n## Fraud and Resistance\n\n### Resistance encouragement\n\nThe black market became a focus of resistance activity, with many resisters seeking to use it as a way to disrupt the German war effort.\n\n### Blaming the Resistance\n\nThe authorities began to blame the Resistance for the black market, seeking to stigmatize it and undermine its legitimacy.\n\n### End of the occupation\n\nAs the occupation drew to a close, the black market continued to thrive, with many individuals and groups seeking to capitalize on the chaos and disorder.\n\n# After the Liberation (1944-1949)\n\n## Épuration and illicit profits\n\n### Pursuit and punishment\n\nThe French authorities, which were now free from German control, began to pursue and punish those who had profited from the black market.\n\n### Confiscation of illicit profits\n\nThe authorities also sought to confiscate the illicit profits that had been made during the occupation, seeking to redistribute them to those who had been most affected by the black market.\n\n## Continued black market operations\n\n### Continued trafficking\n\nDespite the end of the occupation, the black market continued to thrive, with many individuals and groups seeking to capitalize on the continued shortages and disorder.\n\n### Generalized fraud\n\nThe black market became increasingly generalized, with many individuals and groups seeking to engage in fraudulent activity.\n\n### Government powerlessness\n\nThe French government was often powerless to stop the black market, which had become deeply ingrained in the economy and society.\n\n### Towards the free market\n\nAs the economy began to recover, the black market began to decline, with many individuals and groups seeking to engage in legitimate economic activity.\n\n# Historical memory\n\n## Historiography\n\nThe historiography of the black market in wartime France is complex and multifaceted, with many different interpretations and perspectives.\n\n## Collective unconscious and cultural roots\n\n### Early recollections\n\nThe black market has left a lasting impact on French collective memory, with many individuals recalling the shortages and difficulties of the occupation.\n\n### Marcel Aymé\n\nThe French writer Marcel Aymé wrote extensively about the black market, seeking to capture its essence and complexity.\n\n## Major works\n\n### La Traversée de Paris\n\nThe novel \"La Traversée de Paris\" by Marcel Aymé explores the black market and its impact on French society.\n\n### Au bon beurre\n\nThe novel \"Au bon beurre\" by Jean Dutourd explores the black market and its relationship to the French Resistance.\n\n## Historical figures\n\n### L'Étrange Monsieur Joseph\n\nThe figure of \"L'Étrange Monsieur Joseph\" has become a symbol of the black market, representing the complexities and nuances of the occupation.\n\n# See also\n\n* History of France during World War II\n* German occupation of France\n* French Resistance\n* Black market\n\n# Notes\n\n#

She has written for several prominent publications, including The Washington Post and The New York Times, and has become a prominent voice in the conversation around technology's impact on society.\n\n# Early life and education\n\nTaylor Lorenz was born in 1986 in New York City. She grew up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan and developed an early interest in writing and journalism. Lorenz attended the Convent of the Sacred Heart, a private all-girls school in Manhattan, before enrolling at the University of Colorado Boulder, where she studied journalism and graduated with a Bachelor's degree in 2008.\n\nAfter college, Lorenz moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in journalism. She began writing for local publications and websites, covering topics such as entertainment, technology, and lifestyle. In 2010, she moved to New York City to work as a freelance writer, contributing to publications such as The Huffington Post and The New York Observer.\n\n# Career\n\n## The Washington Post\n\nIn 2014, Lorenz joined The Washington Post as a technology reporter, covering the intersection of technology and culture. During her time at the Post, she wrote extensively on topics such as social media, online harassment, and the impact of technology on society. Her reporting took her to the front lines of the tech industry, where she interviewed prominent figures such as Mark Zuckerberg and Evan Spiegel.\n\nLorenz's reporting at the Post was widely praised for its nuance and insight. She was particularly notable for her coverage of the online harassment of women, which helped to shed light on the often-overlooked issue. Her reporting on the topic was recognized with several awards, including a 2016 Online Journalism Award for Best Feature.\n\n## Independent journalism\n\nIn 2019, Lorenz left The Washington Post to pursue independent journalism. She began writing for a variety of publications, including The New York Times, The Atlantic, and Harper's Bazaar. Her reporting continued to focus on the intersection of technology and culture, with a particular emphasis on the ways in which social media is shaping our society.\n\nAs an independent journalist, Lorenz has been able to take on more ambitious projects, including in-depth investigations and feature-length profiles. Her reporting has taken her to the front lines of the tech industry, where she has interviewed prominent figures such as Elon Musk and Jack Dorsey.\n\n# Harassment and coordinated attacks\n\nAs a prominent voice in the conversation around technology and social media, Lorenz has faced her share of online harassment. In 2018, she was targeted by a coordinated attack on Twitter, in which hundreds of users sent her abusive and threatening messages. The attack was widely condemned, with many prominent figures coming to Lorenz's defense.\n\nLorenz has spoken publicly about the impact of online harassment on her life and work. In a 2019 essay for The New York Times, she wrote about the ways in which online abuse can be both personally and professionally debilitating. Her reporting on the topic has helped to shed light on the often-overlooked issue of online harassment, and has sparked a wider conversation about the need for greater accountability and regulation in the tech industry.\n\n# Personal life\n\nLorenz is currently based in New York City, where she lives with her partner and their two dogs. When she is not working, she enjoys hiking and reading. Lorenz is also an avid user of social media, where she can often be found engaging with her followers and sharing her thoughts on the latest developments in the tech industry.\n\n# Selected publications\n\n* \"The most hated man on the internet\" (The New York Times, 2019)\n* \"The online harassment of women is a crisis\" (The Washington Post, 2016)\n* \"The impact of social media on society\" (The Atlantic, 2020)\n* \"The rise of the tech industry's most powerful women\" (Harper's Bazaar, 2020)\n\n# Notes\n\n* This article is based on publicly available information and does not include any interviews or direct quotes from Taylor Lorenz.\n\n# References\n\n* (Not included)\n\n# External links\n\n* Taylor Lorenz on Twitter\n* Taylor Lorenz on Medium", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Taylor_Lorenz\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and education\n#Career\n##The Washington Post\n##Independent journalism\n#Harassment and coordinated attacks\n#Personal life\n#Selected publications\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The crisis saw a significant escalation of tensions, with both sides accusing each other of aggression and provocation.\n\n#Background\n\nNorth Kosovo has been a point of contention between Kosovo and Serbia since the Kosovo War in 1998-1999. The region is home to a majority Serb population, which has historically been opposed to Kosovo's independence. Following the war, the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) was established to govern the region, but Kosovo declared independence in 2008, which was recognized by many Western countries. However, Serbia and many other countries, including Russia and China, do not recognize Kosovo's independence.\n\nThe region has seen periodic outbreaks of violence and tension over the years, but the situation remained relatively calm until 2022, when a series of incidents sparked a significant escalation of tensions.\n\n#Timeline\n\n##2022\n\n###July\n\nThe crisis began in July 2022, when Kosovo's government announced plans to introduce a new license plate system, which would require Serbs in North Kosovo to replace their existing plates with ones issued by the Kosovo government. The move was seen as an attempt by the Kosovo government to assert its authority over the region and was met with fierce resistance from Serbs in North Kosovo.\n\n###August\n\nTensions escalated in August 2022, when a group of Serb protesters blocked a major highway in North Kosovo, preventing Kosovo police and other officials from entering the region. The blockade was seen as a response to the Kosovo government's plans to introduce the new license plate system.\n\n###September\n\nIn September 2022, the situation took a turn for the worse, when a group of masked men attacked a Kosovo police station in North Kosovo, injuring several officers. The attack was widely condemned, and the Kosovo government accused Serbia of being behind the violence.\n\n###October\n\nThe crisis deepened in October 2022, when Kosovo's government announced plans to hold municipal elections in North Kosovo, which were seen as an attempt to assert its authority over the region. The move was met with resistance from Serbs in North Kosovo, who accused the Kosovo government of trying to impose its will on the region.\n\n###November\n\nTensions remained high in November 2022, when a group of Serb protesters clashed with Kosovo police in North Kosovo, resulting in several injuries. The clashes were seen as a response to the Kosovo government's plans to hold municipal elections in the region.\n\n###December\n\nThe situation remained tense in December 2022, when the Kosovo government announced plans to introduce a new border crossing system, which would require Serbs in North Kosovo to use Kosovo-issued documents to cross the border. The move was seen as an attempt by the Kosovo government to assert its authority over the region.\n\n##2023\n\n###January\n\nThe crisis continued into 2023, when a group of Serb protesters blocked a major highway in North Kosovo, preventing Kosovo police and other officials from entering the region. The blockade was seen as a response to the Kosovo government's plans to introduce the new border crossing system.\n\n###February\n\nTensions escalated in February 2023, when a group of masked men attacked a Kosovo police station in North Kosovo, injuring several officers. The attack was widely condemned, and the Kosovo government accused Serbia of being behind the violence.\n\n###March\n\nThe situation took a turn for the worse in March 2023, when a group of Serb protesters clashed with Kosovo police in North Kosovo, resulting in several injuries. The clashes were seen as a response to the Kosovo government's plans to hold municipal elections in the region.\n\n###April\n\nThe crisis deepened in April 2023, when Kosovo's government announced plans to introduce a new tax system, which would require Serbs in North Kosovo to pay taxes to the Kosovo government. The move was seen as an attempt by the Kosovo government to assert its authority over the region.\n\n###May\n\nTensions remained high in May 2023, when a group of Serb protesters blocked a major highway in North Kosovo, preventing Kosovo police and other officials from entering the region. The blockade was seen as a response to the Kosovo government's plans to introduce the new tax system.\n\n###June\n\nThe situation remained tense in June 2023, when the Kosovo government announced plans to hold municipal elections in North Kosovo, which were seen as an attempt to assert its authority over the region.

The United States and the European Union have been particularly vocal in their criticism of the violence, with both sides accusing each other of aggression and provocation.\n\n#See also\n\n* Kosovo War\n* North Kosovo\n* Serbia-Kosovo relations\n* Kosovo status process", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"North_Kosovo_crisis_(2022–2024)\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Timeline\n##2022\n###July\n###August\n###September\n###October\n###November\n###December\n##2023\n###January\n###February\n###March\n###April\n###May\n###June\n###July\n###September\n###October\n###November\n###December\n##2024\n###February\n###August\n#Reactions\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The battle was a key part of the larger Eastern Ukraine campaign during the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n#Background\n\nBakhmut is a strategic city located in the Donetsk Oblast, about 55 kilometers northwest of Donetsk city. The city has a population of around 70,000 people and is an important transportation hub, with several major highways and rail lines passing through it. In 2014, during the initial stages of the Donbas War, Bakhmut was a key stronghold for Ukrainian government forces, but it was eventually captured by Russian-backed separatists. However, in 2016, Ukrainian forces retook control of the city.\n\nIn February 2022, Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine, with the aim of capturing key cities and infrastructure in the eastern part of the country. Bakhmut, due to its strategic location and importance as a transportation hub, became a key objective for both Ukrainian and Russian forces.\n\n#Battle\n\n##Early shelling and Russian encroachment (August–October 2022)\n\nThe battle for Bakhmut began in August 2022, with Russian forces launching a series of artillery and mortar attacks on Ukrainian positions in and around the city. The Ukrainian military responded with counter-battery fire, but the Russian attacks continued, causing significant damage to buildings and infrastructure.\n\nThroughout September and October, Russian forces continued to probe Ukrainian defenses, making small gains in the surrounding countryside. However, Ukrainian forces held firm, and the city remained under their control.\n\n##Early winter escalation (November–December 2022)\n\nIn November 2022, Russian forces launched a major escalation of their attacks on Bakhmut, with intense artillery and infantry assaults aimed at breaching Ukrainian defenses. The Ukrainian military responded with fierce resistance, but Russian forces made significant gains, capturing several key villages and towns in the surrounding area.\n\nThe fighting was intense and brutal, with both sides suffering heavy casualties. The Ukrainian military used drones and precision-guided munitions to target Russian positions, while Russian forces relied on massed artillery and mortar fire to try and overwhelm Ukrainian defenses.\n\n##Capture of Soledar and partial encirclement (January–April 2023)\n\nIn January 2023, Russian forces launched a major assault on the nearby town of Soledar, which was a key stronghold for Ukrainian forces. After weeks of intense fighting, Russian forces captured the town, which gave them control of several key roads and highways leading into Bakhmut.\n\nThe capture of Soledar allowed Russian forces to partially encircle Bakhmut, cutting off several key supply lines and making it difficult for Ukrainian forces to receive reinforcements and supplies. However, Ukrainian forces continued to hold the city, and the fighting remained intense.\n\n##Ukrainian flanking counterattacks begin (May 2023)\n\nIn May 2023, Ukrainian forces launched a series of flanking counterattacks aimed at relieving pressure on Bakhmut and pushing Russian forces back. The counterattacks were successful, with Ukrainian forces making significant gains in the surrounding countryside and recapturing several key villages and towns.\n\n##Capture of Bakhmut and Wagner withdrawal (20 May–early June 2023)\n\nOn May 20, 2023, Russian forces, led by the Wagner Group, launched a final assault on Bakhmut, breaching Ukrainian defenses and capturing the city. However, the victory was short-lived, as Ukrainian forces quickly regrouped and launched a series of counterattacks aimed at retaking the city.\n\nAfter several days of intense fighting, the Wagner Group withdrew from Bakhmut, citing heavy casualties and a lack of supplies. Ukrainian forces quickly retook control of the city, and the battle was effectively over.\n\n#Military strength and tactics\n\nThe battle for Bakhmut was marked by a significant imbalance in military strength and tactics between Ukrainian and Russian forces. Ukrainian forces were outnumbered and outgunned, but they had the advantage of defending a fixed position and were able to use precision-guided munitions and drones to target Russian positions.\n\nRussian forces, on the other hand, relied on massed artillery and mortar fire to try and overwhelm Ukrainian defenses. However, the Russian military's reliance on outdated tactics and equipment, combined with a lack of coordination and communication between different units, made it difficult for them to achieve a decisive victory.\n\n#Aftermath\n\n##Strategic value\n\nThe battle for Bakhmut was a key part of the larger Eastern Ukraine campaign, and the city's capture was a significant strategic victory for Russian forces. However, the victory came at a high cost, with both sides suffering heavy casualties and significant damage to infrastructure.\n\n##Battlefield conditions\n\nThe battlefield around Bakhmut was marked by significant destruction and chaos, with buildings reduced to rubble and infrastructure severely damaged. The city's water and electricity supplies were also severely disrupted, making it difficult for civilians to access basic necessities.\n\n##Casualties\n\n###Military casualties\n\nThe exact number of military casualties during the battle for Bakhmut is difficult to determine, but it is estimated that both sides suffered heavy losses. Ukrainian forces reported that they had killed or wounded thousands of Russian soldiers, while Russian forces claimed to have inflicted significant casualties on Ukrainian troops.\n\n###Civilian casualties\n\nThe battle for Bakhmut also resulted in significant civilian casualties, with many residents of the city and surrounding area killed or wounded in the fighting. The exact number of civilian casualties is difficult to determine, but it is estimated that hundreds of civilians were killed or injured during the battle.\n\n##Attrition\n\nThe battle for Bakhmut was marked by significant attrition on both sides, with both Ukrainian and Russian forces suffering heavy casualties and significant damage to equipment and infrastructure. The attrition was particularly severe for Russian forces, who lost many experienced soldiers and significant amounts of equipment during the fighting.\n\n##Result\n\nThe battle for Bakhmut was a strategic victory for Russian forces, but it came at a high cost. The city's capture gave Russian forces control of a key transportation hub and allowed them to exert pressure on Ukrainian forces in the surrounding area. However, the victory was short-lived, as Ukrainian forces quickly regrouped and launched a series of counterattacks aimed at retaking the city.\n\n#Allegations of war crimes\n\nBoth Ukrainian and Russian forces have been accused of committing war crimes during the battle for Bakhmut, including the use of indiscriminate artillery fire and the targeting of civilians. The allegations are difficult to verify, but human rights groups have reported significant abuses on both sides.\n\n#See also\n\n* Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* Donbas War\n* Wagner Group\n* Eastern Ukraine campaign\n\n#Notes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Battle_of_Bakhmut\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Battle\n##Early shelling and Russian encroachment (August–October 2022)\n##Early winter escalation (November–December 2022)\n##Capture of Soledar and partial encirclement (January–April 2023)\n##Ukrainian flanking counterattacks begin (May 2023)\n##Capture of Bakhmut and Wagner withdrawal (20 May–early June 2023)\n#Military strength and tactics\n#Aftermath\n##Strategic value\n##Battlefield conditions\n##Casualties\n###Military casualties\n###Civilian casualties\n##Attrition\n##Result\n#Allegations of war crimes\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born on October 16, 1925, in Regent's Park, London, Lansbury has established herself as one of the most respected and beloved entertainers of her generation. With a career marked by versatility, dedication, and numerous accolades, Lansbury continues to captivate audiences with her timeless talent.\n\n#Early life and career beginnings\n\n##Childhood: 1925–1942\n\nAngela Lansbury was born to Edgar Lansbury, a timber merchant, and Moyna Macgill, an actress. Her father was a member of the Communist Party, and her mother was of Irish descent. Lansbury's early life was marked by the challenges of World War II, during which her family relocated to the United States. In 1940, the family settled in New York City, where Lansbury attended the Feagin School of Dramatic Art and later the Lucille Lortel's American Theatre Wing.\n\n##Career breakthrough: 1942–1945\n\nLansbury's first professional role was as a nightclub singer in New York City. She soon landed a contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), making her screen debut in the 1944 film \"Gaslight.\" Her performance as Nancy Oliver, a flirtatious and cunning maid, earned her an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress. This early success marked the beginning of a long and fruitful relationship between Lansbury and MGM.\n\n##Later MGM films: 1945–1951\n\nThroughout the 1940s and 1950s, Lansbury appeared in a range of MGM films, including \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" (1945), \"The Harvey Girls\" (1946), and \"State of the Union\" (1948). Her performances showcased her versatility and talent, solidifying her position as a rising star in Hollywood.\n\n#Mid career\n\n##The Manchurian Candidate and minor roles: 1952–1965\n\nIn the early 1950s, Lansbury's career began to slow, and she took on smaller roles in films such as \"Mutiny\" (1952) and \"A Lawless Street\" (1955). However, her performance as Eleanor Iselin in \"The Manchurian Candidate\" (1962) earned her a second Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress. This film marked a turning point in her career, as she began to transition from minor roles to more substantial and complex characters.\n\n##Mame and theatrical stardom: 1966–1969\n\nLansbury's stage career gained momentum in the 1960s, particularly with her iconic portrayal of Mame Dennis in the musical \"Mame\" (1966). Her performance earned her a Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical and cemented her status as a Broadway star. Lansbury's success in \"Mame\" led to further theatrical roles, including \"Dear World\" (1969) and \"Gypsy\" (1970).\n\n##Ireland and Gypsy: 1970–1978\n\nIn the early 1970s, Lansbury relocated to Ireland, where she lived for several years. During this time, she continued to work in film and theater, appearing in productions such as \"Gypsy\" (1970) and \"The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane\" (1976).\n\n##Sweeney Todd and continued cinematic work: 1979–1984\n\nLansbury's return to the United States marked a resurgence in her film career. Her performance as Nellie Lovett in the musical \"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\" (1979) earned her a third Tony Award and a Grammy Award. Throughout the 1980s, Lansbury continued to work in film, appearing in \"The Mirror Crack'd\" (1980) and \"The Company of Wolves\" (1984).\n\n#Global fame\n\n##Murder, She Wrote: 1984–2003\n\nLansbury's most iconic role came in 1984, when she began starring as Jessica Fletcher in the television series \"Murder, She Wrote.\" The show ran for 12 seasons, earning Lansbury multiple Emmy nominations and a Golden Globe Award. Her performance as the intelligent and determined mystery writer cemented her status as a household name, and the show remains one of the most popular and enduring television series of all time.\n\n##Final years: 2003–2022\n\nIn the years following \"Murder, She Wrote,\" Lansbury continued to work in film, television, and theater. She appeared in productions such as \"Nanny McPhee\" (2005) and \"Mary Poppins Returns\" (2018). Lansbury also remained committed to her craft, continuing to perform and entertain audiences well into her 90s.\n\n#Personal life\n\nAngela Lansbury has been married twice, first to Richard Cromwell in 1945 and then to Peter Shaw in 1949. She has two children, Anthony Shaw and Deirdre Shaw. Lansbury has been open about her personal struggles, including her family's relocation during World War II and her early struggles in Hollywood.\n\n#Honours and legacy\n\nThroughout her career, Lansbury has received numerous accolades, including three Tony Awards, six Golden Globe Awards, and 12 Emmy nominations. She was appointed a Commandeur of the Order of the British Empire in 1994 and a Dame Commander in 2014. Lansbury's contributions to the entertainment industry have been recognized with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and a place in the American Theater Hall of Fame.\n\n#Publications\n\nLansbury has written several books, including her autobiography \"Balancing Act\" (1988) and \"Positive Moves: My Approach to Life\" (1990).\n\n#See also\n\n* List of Angela Lansbury's awards and nominations\n* List of Angela Lansbury's film and television credits\n\n#Notes\n\n* Angela Lansbury's early life and career are well-documented in her autobiography \"Balancing Act.\"\n\n#References\n\n* This article is based on available sources and does not include citations or references.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Angela_Lansbury\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and career beginnings\n##Childhood: 1925–1942\n##Career breakthrough: 1942–1945\n##Later MGM films: 1945–1951\n#Mid career\n##The Manchurian Candidate and minor roles: 1952–1965\n##Mame and theatrical stardom: 1966–1969\n##Ireland and Gypsy: 1970–1978\n##Sweeney Todd and continued cinematic work: 1979–1984\n#Global fame\n##Murder, She Wrote: 1984–2003\n##Final years: 2003–2022\n#Personal life\n#Honours and legacy\n#Publications\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n##Citations\n##General and cited sources\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The museum was founded in 1820 and has since become one of the most important cultural institutions in the state of Hesse.\n\n# History\n\nThe Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt was founded in 1820 by Grand Duke Louis I of Hesse, who donated a significant portion of his private art collection to the state. The museum's initial focus was on art and antiquities, but over the years, its scope expanded to include natural history, cultural history, and archaeology. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the museum underwent significant expansions, including the addition of new buildings and the acquisition of several important collections.\n\nDuring World War II, the museum suffered significant damage and loss, including the destruction of many of its buildings and the loss of a large portion of its collection. After the war, the museum underwent a major reconstruction effort, which included the rebuilding of damaged buildings and the acquisition of new collections.\n\nIn recent years, the museum has continued to expand and modernize, with a focus on making its collections and exhibitions more accessible to the public. In 2019, the museum celebrated its 200th anniversary with a major exhibition and a series of events and programs.\n\n# Building\n\n## Location\n\nThe Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt is located in the heart of Darmstadt, near the city's main square. The museum's main building is a large, imposing structure that dates back to the 19th century. The building has undergone several renovations and expansions over the years, including the addition of a modern wing in the 1980s.\n\n## Renovations and extensions\n\nIn recent years, the museum has undergone several major renovations and extensions, including the restoration of its historic main building and the addition of new exhibition spaces. In 2014, the museum completed a major renovation of its natural history collection, which included the installation of new exhibits and the creation of a large, glass-roofed atrium.\n\nIn 2019, the museum opened a new wing dedicated to the art and culture of the 20th and 21st centuries. The new wing features a large, open exhibition space, as well as several smaller galleries and a rooftop garden.\n\n# Collections\n\nThe Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt has a diverse range of collections, including art, antiquities, natural history, cultural history, and archaeology. The museum's art collection includes works by famous artists such as Rubens, Rembrandt, and Picasso, as well as a large collection of modern and contemporary art.\n\nThe museum's natural history collection includes a large collection of taxidermied animals, including a giant squid and a polar bear. The collection also includes several dinosaur fossils, including a Tyrannosaurus rex skull.\n\nThe museum's cultural history collection includes a large collection of artifacts related to the history of Hesse, including clothing, furniture, and household items. The collection also includes a large collection of ethnographic artifacts from around the world.\n\n# Gallery\n\nThe Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt has a large, rotating gallery space that features temporary exhibitions on a wide range of topics. Recent exhibitions have included shows on ancient Egypt, the art of the Renaissance, and the natural history of the Amazon rainforest.\n\nIn addition to its rotating exhibitions, the museum also has several permanent galleries, including a gallery dedicated to the art and culture of the 20th and 21st centuries, and a gallery dedicated to the natural history of Hesse.\n\n# Special exhibitions\n\nThe Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt hosts several special exhibitions each year, which are often accompanied by lectures, workshops, and other events. Recent special exhibitions have included shows on the art of Vincent van Gogh, the history of the German automobile industry, and the natural history of the Mediterranean region.\n\nIn 2019, the museum hosted a major special exhibition on the art and culture of the Bauhaus movement, which included works by famous artists such as Klee, Kandinsky, and Moholy-Nagy.\n\n# Controversies\n\nThe Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt has been involved in several controversies over the years, including disputes over the ownership and display of certain artworks. In 2018, the museum was criticized for its handling of a collection of artworks looted by the Nazis during World War II.\n\nIn 2020, the museum was involved in a controversy over its decision to remove a statue of a colonial-era German general from its grounds. The decision was criticized by some as an attempt to erase history, while others praised the museum for taking a step towards greater inclusivity and sensitivity.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of museums in Germany\n* List of art museums in Germany\n* List of natural history museums in Germany\n\n# Films\n\nThe Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt has been featured in several films and television shows over the years, including documentaries, dramas, and comedies.
