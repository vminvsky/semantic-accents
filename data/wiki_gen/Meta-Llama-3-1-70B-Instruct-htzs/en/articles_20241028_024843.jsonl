During this three-day period, a series of tornadoes touched down across several states, causing widespread damage and loss of life. The outbreak was characterized by multiple long-lived tornadoes, including a rare EF4 tornado that caused significant destruction in Iowa.\n\n#Meteorological synopsis\n\n##March 5\n\nOn March 5, a strong low-pressure system developed over the Rocky Mountains, leading to a surge of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico into the central Plains. As the system moved eastward, it interacted with a strong cold front, creating a highly unstable atmosphere. This led to the development of thunderstorms across the southern Great Plains, including parts of Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas.\n\n##March 6–7\n\nOver the next two days, the low-pressure system continued to move eastward, bringing the unstable atmosphere with it. On March 6, a strong squall line developed across the Midwest, producing numerous tornadoes across Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio. As the system moved into the Ohio Valley on March 7, it interacted with a strong cold front, leading to the development of additional tornadoes across parts of Kentucky, Tennessee, and West Virginia.\n\n#Confirmed tornadoes\n\n##March 5 event\n\nOn March 5, a total of 15 tornadoes were confirmed across the southern Great Plains. The strongest tornado of the day was an EF2 tornado that touched down in northern Texas, causing significant damage to homes and businesses.\n\n##March 6 event\n\nOn March 6, a total of 27 tornadoes were confirmed across the Midwest. The strongest tornado of the day was an EF3 tornado that touched down in central Illinois, causing significant damage to homes and businesses.\n\n##March 7 event\n\nOn March 7, a total of 17 tornadoes were confirmed across the Ohio Valley. The strongest tornado of the day was an EF4 tornado that touched down in southern Kentucky, causing significant damage to homes and businesses.\n\n##Macksburg–Winterset–Norwalk–Colfax–Newton, Iowa\n\nOne of the most significant tornadoes of the outbreak occurred on March 5, when a rare EF4 tornado touched down in central Iowa. The tornado, which was on the ground for over 60 miles, caused significant damage to homes and businesses in the towns of Macksburg, Winterset, Norwalk, Colfax, and Newton. The tornado was particularly devastating in the town of Winterset, where entire city blocks were leveled.\n\n#Aftermath\n\nThe tornado outbreak of March 5–7, 2022, caused widespread damage and loss of life across the central United States. In total, over 100 homes and businesses were destroyed, and numerous people were injured. The outbreak also caused significant disruptions to transportation and commerce, with numerous roads and highways closed due to damage.\n\n#See also\n\n* List of tornado outbreaks\n* List of tornadoes in the United States\n* Tornado intensity and damage\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is based on preliminary reports and may be updated as additional information becomes available.\n\n#References\n\n(No references cited)\n\n#External links\n\n(No external links provided)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Tornado_outbreak_of_March_5–7,_2022\" following this outline:\n\n#Meteorological synopsis\n##March 5\n##March 6–7\n#Confirmed tornadoes\n##March 5 event\n##March 6 event\n##March 7 event\n##Macksburg–Winterset–Norwalk–Colfax–Newton, Iowa\n#Aftermath\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The case has sparked intense debate and controversy over the issues of medical treatment, parental rights, and the role of the state in end-of-life decisions.\n\n# Incident\n\nOn April 7, 2022, Archie Battersbee was found unresponsive at his home in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, with a ligature around his neck. He was rushed to Southend Hospital, where he was placed on a ventilator and later transferred to the Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel, London, for further treatment. Despite receiving extensive medical care, Archie's condition did not improve, and he was diagnosed with a severe brain injury.\n\n# Legal cases\n\nThe Archie Battersbee case has been the subject of multiple legal proceedings, including applications to the High Court, the Court of Appeal, and the European Court of Human Rights. The case has raised complex questions about the law surrounding medical treatment, parental consent, and the role of the state in end-of-life decisions.\n\nIn May 2022, Archie's parents, Hollie Dance and Paul Battersbee, launched a High Court bid to prevent the hospital from withdrawing life-sustaining treatment from their son. The hospital had applied to the court for permission to withdraw treatment, citing Archie's poor prognosis and the fact that continued treatment would not be in his best interests.\n\nThe High Court ruled in favor of the hospital, allowing them to withdraw life-sustaining treatment. Archie's parents appealed the decision to the Court of Appeal, which upheld the High Court's ruling.

He is considered one of the most important figures in the history of philosophy, and his ideas had a profound impact on Western thought. Plotinus's philosophy is characterized by its emphasis on the spiritual and the mystical, and his writings on the nature of reality, the universe, and the human condition remain influential to this day.\n\nBiography\n=========\n### Expedition to Persia and return to Rome\n\nPlotinus was born in Lycopolis, Egypt, around 205 CE. Little is known about his early life, but it is believed that he was born into a wealthy family and received a good education. In his late 20s, Plotinus became interested in philosophy and sought out the teachings of Ammonius Saccas, a renowned philosopher in Alexandria. However, he soon became dissatisfied with Ammonius's teachings and set out to find a more satisfying philosophical system.\n\nIn 243 CE, Plotinus joined the Roman Emperor Gordian III's expedition to Persia, hoping to learn about the philosophical traditions of the East. However, the expedition was unsuccessful, and Gordian III was killed in battle. Plotinus escaped and made his way back to Rome, where he settled and began to teach his own philosophical system.\n\n### Later life\n\nPlotinus spent the remainder of his life in Rome, teaching and writing about his philosophical ideas. He attracted a devoted following of students, including the Roman Emperor Gallienus, and his teachings became widely known throughout the Roman Empire. Despite his fame, Plotinus remained humble and devoted to his philosophical pursuits. He died in 270 CE, at the age of 65, and was buried in the Campania region of Italy.\n\nMajor ideas\n===========\n### The One\n\nAt the heart of Plotinus's philosophy is the concept of the One, also known as the Source or the Unity. The One is the ultimate reality, the source of all existence, and the goal of all human striving. It is the unchanging, eternal, and infinite essence that underlies all of reality. The One is beyond human comprehension, and it can only be approached through mystical experience.\n\n### Emanation by the One\n\nAccording to Plotinus, the One emanates a series of lesser realities, including the Intellect, the Soul, and the material world. The Intellect is the realm of abstract thought and reasoning, while the Soul is the realm of emotions and desires. The material world is the lowest level of reality, and it is characterized by change, impermanence, and multiplicity.\n\n### The true human and happiness\n\nPlotinus believed that the true human is the soul, which is immortal and eternal. The goal of human life is to achieve happiness and fulfillment, which can only be attained by realizing one's true nature as a soul. This involves transcending the limitations of the material world and the desires of the body, and achieving a state of inner peace and unity with the One.\n\n### Henosis\n\nHenosis is the term used by Plotinus to describe the state of unity or oneness with the One. It is the ultimate goal of human striving, and it can only be achieved through a process of spiritual purification and self-transformation. Henosis involves the transcendence of the ego and the realization of one's true nature as a spark of the divine.\n\nRelation with contemporary philosophy and religion\n================================================\n### Plotinus's Relation to Plato\n\nPlotinus was deeply influenced by the philosophy of Plato, and his own ideas can be seen as a development of Plato's thought. However, Plotinus also critiqued certain aspects of Plato's philosophy, particularly his theory of forms. Plotinus believed that the forms were not separate entities, but rather aspects of the One.\n\n### Plotinus and the Gnostics\n\nPlotinus was also influenced by Gnosticism, a mystical movement that emerged in the 1st century CE. However, Plotinus critiqued certain aspects of Gnosticism, particularly its emphasis on the material world as evil. Plotinus believed that the material world was not evil, but rather a lower level of reality that could be transcended through spiritual practice.\n\n### Against causal astrology\n\nPlotinus was also critical of causal astrology, which held that the positions of the stars and planets could influence human affairs. Plotinus believed that the stars and planets were not causes, but rather signs or symbols of deeper spiritual realities.\n\nFilm studies\n=============\nThere are no direct film studies on Plotinus, but his ideas have influenced various filmmakers and artists throughout history.\n\nInfluence\n=========\n### Ancient world\n\nPlotinus's ideas had a profound impact on the ancient world, influencing philosophers such as Porphyry, Iamblichus, and Proclus. His ideas also influenced early Christian theologians, such as Origen and St. Augustine.\n\n### Christianity\n\nPlotinus's ideas had a significant impact on the development of Christian theology, particularly in the areas of mysticism and the nature of God. His ideas about the One and the Intellect influenced the development of the doctrine of the Trinity.\n\n### Islam\n\nPlotinus's ideas also influenced Islamic philosophy, particularly in the areas of mysticism and the nature of God. His ideas about the One and the Intellect influenced the development of Sufism, a mystical movement within Islam.\n\n### Judaism\n\nPlotinus's ideas also influenced Jewish philosophy, particularly in the areas of mysticism and the nature of God. His ideas about the One and the Intellect influenced the development of Kabbalah, a mystical movement within Judaism.\n\n### Renaissance\n\nPlotinus's ideas experienced a revival during the Renaissance, influencing philosophers such as Marsilio Ficino and Pico della Mirandola. His ideas about the One and the Intellect influenced the development of Renaissance humanism.\n\n### Great Britain\n\nPlotinus's ideas also influenced British philosophers, such as Ralph Cudworth and Henry More. His ideas about the One and the Intellect influenced the development of British idealism.\n\n### India\n\nPlotinus's ideas also influenced Indian philosophers, such as Shankara and Ramanuja. His ideas about the One and the Intellect influenced the development of Advaita Vedanta, a school of Indian philosophy.\n\nSee also\n========\n* Neoplatonism\n* Plato\n* Gnosticism\n* Mysticism\n* Theurgy\n\nNotes\n=====\n\nReferences\n==========\n\nBibliography\n============\n\n* Plotinus.

The battle was a continuation of the War in Donbas, which began in 2014, and marked a significant escalation of hostilities in the region.\n\n# Background\n\n## War in Donbas\n\nThe War in Donbas began in April 2014, when pro-Russian separatists in the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts declared independence from Ukraine. The conflict escalated into a full-scale war between Ukrainian government forces and the separatist Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) and Luhansk People's Republic (LPR), which were supported by Russia. Despite a ceasefire agreement in 2015, fighting continued in the region, resulting in significant loss of life and displacement of civilians.\n\n## Prior operations\n\nPrior to the 2022 invasion, Russian forces had been involved in several operations in the Donbas region. In 2014, Russian troops annexed Crimea, and in 2015, they supported the separatist forces in the DPR and LPR. In 2021, Russia conducted a large-scale military exercise near the Ukrainian border, which was seen as a precursor to the 2022 invasion.\n\n# Prelude\n\n## Russian objectives\n\nThe Russian objectives in the Donbas region were to capture key cities and infrastructure, including the cities of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk, and to establish a land bridge between the DPR and LPR. Russia also sought to weaken the Ukrainian military and gain control over the region's natural resources, including coal and iron ore.\n\n# Opposing forces and foreign involvement\n\n## Russian and pro-Russian forces\n\nThe Russian military and its allies, including the DPR and LPR, had a significant advantage in terms of numbers and equipment. The Russian military had deployed thousands of troops, tanks, and artillery systems to the region, while the DPR and LPR had also mobilized their own forces. The Russian military had also established a network of supply lines and logistics hubs to support its operations.\n\n## Ukrainian forces\n\nThe Ukrainian military had also deployed significant forces to the region, including infantry, artillery, and armored units. The Ukrainian military had also established a network of defensive positions and fortifications, including trenches and bunkers.\n\n### Foreign support for Ukraine\n\nThe Ukrainian military received significant support from foreign countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and other NATO member states. This support included military aid, including equipment and training, as well as economic and humanitarian assistance.\n\n# Battle\n\n## Early operations (April–May 2022)\n\n### Popasna\n\nThe battle began on April 18, 2022, when Russian forces launched an attack on the city of Popasna, which was held by Ukrainian forces.

The country is located in a region with high levels of rainfall and snowmelt, which can cause rivers to overflow and flood surrounding areas. In addition, climate change has increased the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, such as heavy rainfall, which can lead to devastating floods.\n\nIn 2022, Pakistan experienced a severe heatwave in the months leading up to the monsoon season, which dried out the soil and vegetation.

The event recognized the best in music for the eligibility period between September 1, 2020, and September 30, 2021.

The election was a crucial moment in Kenyan history, marking the first time a sitting president, Uhuru Kenyatta, was not seeking re-election due to term limits.\n\n#Background\n\nThe 2022 Kenyan general election was the third general election held under the 2010 Constitution. The election was initially scheduled for August 2022, but the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) considered postponing it due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the commission eventually confirmed that the election would take place as scheduled.\n\nThe 2022 election was significant, as it marked the end of the Jubilee Party's rule, which had been in power since 2013. President Uhuru Kenyatta, who was term-limited, had endorsed his deputy, William Ruto, as his preferred successor. However, Ruto's bid was challenged by Raila Odinga, a veteran politician who had run for president four times before.\n\n#Electoral system\n\nKenya's electoral system is based on a mixed-member system, where voters elect representatives to the National Assembly and Senate through a combination of first-past-the-post and proportional representation. The President is elected through a two-round system, where a candidate must receive more than 50% of the vote to win.\n\n#Presidential candidates\n\nFour candidates were cleared by the IEBC to run for president:\n\n1. Raila Odinga - Azimio la Umoja-One Kenya Alliance\n2. William Ruto - Kenya Kwanza Alliance\n3. George Wajackoyah - Roots Party of Kenya\n4. David Waihiga Mwaure - Agano Party\n\n##Presidential nomination\n\nThe nomination process for presidential candidates took place in April and May 2022. The IEBC required candidates to submit nomination papers, which included signatures from at least 2,000 registered voters from each of the 47 counties.\n\n##Deputy presidential nomination\n\nEach presidential candidate was required to choose a running mate. Raila Odinga chose Martha Karua, a former Justice Minister, as his running mate. William Ruto chose Rigathi Gachagua, a former Mathira MP, as his running mate.\n\n##Manifestos\n\nEach presidential candidate launched a manifesto, outlining their vision for Kenya. Raila Odinga's manifesto focused on economic growth, corruption, and healthcare. William Ruto's manifesto emphasized economic empowerment, agriculture, and education.\n\n##Electoral candidates debates\n\nThe IEBC organized two presidential debates, which were broadcast live on television and radio. The debates allowed candidates to present their policies and answer questions from journalists and the public.\n\n##Campaign season\n\nThe campaign season began in April 2022 and lasted for three months. Candidates crisscrossed the country, holding rallies and meetings with voters. The campaign season was marked by intense competition, with candidates using social media to reach out to voters.\n\n#Conduct\n\nThe IEBC was responsible for conducting the election. The commission took several measures to ensure the election was free and fair.\n\n##Mass voter listing\n\nThe IEBC conducted a mass voter listing exercise, which aimed to register new voters and update the voter register. The exercise took place in January and February 2022.\n\n##Electoral candidates clearance\n\nThe IEBC cleared candidates to run for various elective positions, including president, governor, senator, and MP.\n\n##IEBC preparation for general election\n\nThe IEBC prepared for the election by training poll officials, distributing election materials, and setting up polling stations.\n\n##General elections\n\nThe election took place on August 9, 2022. Polling stations opened at 6:00 am and closed at 5:00 pm. Voters cast their ballots for president, governor, senator, and MP.\n\n##Interference\n\nThere were concerns about interference in the election, particularly from the ruling Jubilee Party. However, the IEBC assured voters that it had taken measures to prevent interference.\n\n#Opinion polls\n\nSeveral opinion polls were conducted before the election. The polls showed a tight contest between Raila Odinga and William Ruto.\n\n##Graphical summary of opinion polls\n\n| Pollster | Date | Raila Odinga | William Ruto |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Ipsos | July 2022 | 47% | 44% |\n| Tifa | July 2022 | 45% | 42% |\n| Infotrak | August 2022 | 48% | 45% |\n\n#Results and reactions\n\nThe IEBC announced the results of the election on August 15, 2022.\n\n##President\n\nWilliam Ruto was declared the winner of the presidential election, receiving 50.49% of the vote. Raila Odinga received 48.85% of the vote.\n\n###By county\n\n| County | William Ruto | Raila Odinga |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Nairobi | 43.6% | 53.1% |\n| Kiambu | 64.1% | 33.5% |\n| Nakuru | 58.2% | 39.5% |\n\n##Parliament\n\n###National Assembly\n\nThe Kenya Kwanza Alliance won 179 seats in the National Assembly, while the Azimio la Umoja-One Kenya Alliance won 157 seats.\n\n###Senate\n\nThe Kenya Kwanza Alliance won 24 seats in the Senate, while the Azimio la Umoja-One Kenya Alliance won 23 seats.\n\n#Misinformation on various social media\n\nThere were concerns about misinformation on social media, particularly on Twitter and Facebook.

The mission involves intentionally crashing a spacecraft into a small asteroid, Dimorphos, which orbits a larger asteroid, Didymos, to alter its trajectory. The DART mission is a crucial step towards developing a planetary defense system that can protect Earth from potential asteroid impacts.\n\nMission History\n-------------\n\nThe DART mission was conceived in 2015 as a response to the growing concern about the threat posed by near-Earth asteroids. In 2016, NASA approved the mission and began development. The mission was initially scheduled to launch in 2022, but it was later delayed to November 2021. The DART spacecraft was launched on November 24, 2021, aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California.\n\nDescription\n-----------\n\n### Spacecraft\n\nThe DART spacecraft is a small, cube-shaped satellite that measures about 1.2 meters (4 feet) on each side. It has a mass of approximately 610 kilograms (1,344 pounds) and is powered by solar panels. The spacecraft is equipped with a camera, solar arrays, an antenna, and an ion thruster.\n\n#### Camera\n\nThe DART spacecraft is equipped with a high-resolution camera called the Didymos Reconnaissance and Asteroid Camera for Optical (DRACO) navigation. The camera is used to capture images of the asteroid and its surroundings, which helps the spacecraft to navigate and identify the target.\n\n#### Solar Arrays\n\nThe DART spacecraft has two solar arrays that provide power to the spacecraft. The solar arrays are made of gallium arsenide solar cells and have a total surface area of about 7 square meters (75 square feet).\n\n#### Antenna\n\nThe DART spacecraft has a high-gain antenna that is used for communication with Earth. The antenna is a 1-meter (3.3-foot) diameter dish that provides a high-gain communication link with the Deep Space Network.\n\n#### Ion Thruster\n\nThe DART spacecraft is equipped with an ion thruster that provides propulsion. The ion thruster uses xenon gas to generate thrust and is capable of producing a specific impulse of about 3,000 seconds.\n\n### Secondary Spacecraft\n\nThe DART mission includes a secondary spacecraft called the Light Italian CubeSat for Imaging Asteroids (LICIACube). LICIACube is a small, 6-unit cube satellite that was built by the Italian Space Agency. The spacecraft is equipped with two cameras and is designed to capture images of the asteroid and the impact site.\n\n### Effect of the Impact on Dimorphos and Didymos\n\nThe DART spacecraft is designed to impact Dimorphos, the smaller asteroid, at a speed of about 6 kilometers per second (3.7 miles per second). The impact is expected to transfer a significant amount of momentum to the asteroid, causing it to change its trajectory. The asteroid's orbital period is expected to decrease by about 10 minutes as a result of the impact.\n\n### Observations of the Impact\n\nThe DART mission includes several observations of the impact site. The LICIACube spacecraft will capture images of the asteroid and the impact site, while the Hubble Space Telescope and other ground-based telescopes will observe the asteroid's orbit and brightness changes.\n\n### Follow-up Mission\n\nThe DART mission will be followed by a European Space Agency (ESA) mission called Hera. The Hera mission will launch in 2024 and will include a spacecraft that will orbit the Didymos asteroid system to measure the asteroid's mass and composition.\n\n### AIDA Mission Architecture\n\nThe DART mission is part of a larger mission architecture called the Asteroid Impact and Deflection Assessment (AIDA). The AIDA mission architecture includes several missions that are designed to test different methods for deflecting asteroids.\n\nMission Profile\n-------------\n\n### Target Asteroid\n\nThe target asteroid for the DART mission is Dimorphos, a small asteroid that orbits the larger asteroid Didymos. Dimorphos has a diameter of about 160 meters (525 feet) and orbits Didymos at a distance of about 1 kilometer (0.6 miles).\n\n### Preflight Preparations\n\nThe DART spacecraft underwent several preflight preparations, including integration with the launch vehicle and testing of the spacecraft's systems.\n\n### Launch\n\nThe DART spacecraft was launched on November 24, 2021, aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California.\n\n### Transit\n\nThe DART spacecraft traveled through space for about 10 months, during which time it performed several course corrections to ensure that it remained on track for the asteroid.\n\n### Course of the Impact\n\nThe DART spacecraft encountered the Dimorphos asteroid on September 26, 2022. The spacecraft performed a final course correction about 1 hour before impact and then intentionally crashed into the asteroid at a speed of about 6 kilometers per second (3.7 miles per second).\n\n#### Sequence of Operations for Impact\n\nThe sequence of operations for the impact was as follows:\n\n1. The DART spacecraft performed a final course correction about 1 hour before impact.\n2. The spacecraft's camera captured images of the asteroid and its surroundings.\n3. The spacecraft's ion thruster was turned off, and the spacecraft began to coast towards the asteroid.\n4. The spacecraft impacted the asteroid at a speed of about 6 kilometers per second (3.7 miles per second).\n5.

He has been a prominent figure in Russian politics and international relations, with significant interests in Africa and the Middle East. Prigozhin's life and career have been marked by controversy, from his early days as a convicted felon to his rise as a influential figure in Russian politics.\n\nEarly Life and Education\n------------------------\n\nYevgeny Prigozhin was born on June 1, 1961, in Leningrad, Soviet Union (now Saint Petersburg, Russia). His early life is not well-documented, but it is known that he was raised in a working-class family. Prigozhin's education is also not well-documented, but it is believed that he attended a local high school and later studied at a technical college.\n\n### Criminal History and Imprisonment\n\nIn 1981, Prigozhin was arrested and convicted of robbery and fraud. He was sentenced to 12 years in prison, but was released after serving nine years. During his time in prison, Prigozhin reportedly became acquainted with other high-profile Russian criminals, including Viktor Bout, a notorious arms dealer.\n\nEarly Career and Rise to Prominence\n-----------------------------------\n\nAfter his release from prison, Prigozhin began to build a business empire. He started with small ventures, including a hot dog stand and a used car dealership. However, it was his involvement in the restaurant business that brought him significant success. Prigozhin's company, Concord Management and Consulting, became a major player in the Russian catering industry, providing services to government agencies and high-profile clients.\n\nPrigozhin's success in the restaurant business led to his involvement in Russian politics. He became a close associate of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who had previously worked as a KGB officer in Leningrad. Prigozhin's company provided catering services to the Kremlin, and he became a frequent guest at high-profile events.\n\nWagner Group\n------------\n\nIn 2014, Prigozhin became involved in the formation of the Wagner Group, a private military company. The group was reportedly established by Dmitry Utkin, a former Russian Spetsnaz officer, with Prigozhin providing financial backing. The Wagner Group quickly gained a reputation for its involvement in high-profile conflicts, including the Russian annexation of Crimea and the Syrian Civil War.\n\n### Russian Invasion of Ukraine\n\nIn 2022, the Wagner Group played a significant role in the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The group's fighters were involved in several high-profile battles, including the siege of Mariupol. Prigozhin's involvement in the invasion was widely reported, with many analysts suggesting that he was acting on behalf of the Russian government.\n\n### Conflict with Russian Ministry of Defense\n\nDespite his close ties to the Russian government, Prigozhin has been involved in several high-profile conflicts with the Russian Ministry of Defense. In 2022, he publicly criticized the ministry's handling of the war in Ukraine, suggesting that they were not providing sufficient support to the Wagner Group. The conflict escalated in 2023, when Prigozhin accused the ministry of corruption and incompetence.\n\n### Prigozhin as a Populist Critic\n\nPrigozhin's criticism of the Russian Ministry of Defense has been seen as part of a broader populist campaign. He has positioned himself as a champion of the Russian people, criticizing the government for its perceived corruption and incompetence. Prigozhin's message has resonated with many Russians, who see him as a straight-talking outsider who is willing to challenge the establishment.\n\n### June 2023 Rebellion\n\nIn June 2023, Prigozhin led a rebellion against the Russian government. The rebellion, which was sparked by a series of disputes with the Ministry of Defense, saw Prigozhin's Wagner Group fighters march on Moscow. The rebellion was ultimately put down, but it marked a significant turning point in Prigozhin's career. He was forced to flee Russia, and his future remains uncertain.\n\nAfrica Interests\n----------------\n\nIn addition to his involvement in the Wagner Group, Prigozhin has significant interests in Africa. His company, Concord Management and Consulting, has provided security services to several African governments, including those of Sudan and the Central African Republic. Prigozhin has also been involved in several high-profile mining ventures, including a gold mine in Sudan.\n\nInternet Research Agency\n-------------------------\n\nThe Internet Research Agency (IRA) is a Russian troll farm that was reportedly established by Prigozhin in 2013. The IRA has been involved in several high-profile disinformation campaigns, including the 2016 US presidential election. Prigozhin's involvement in the IRA has been widely reported, although he has denied any direct connection to the organization.\n\n### Spin-offs\n\nThe IRA has spawned several spin-off organizations, including the Federal News Agency (FAN) and the Economic News Agency (ENA). These organizations have been involved in several high-profile disinformation campaigns, including the promotion of conspiracy theories about COVID-19.\n\nInternational Sanctions\n-------------------------\n\nPrigozhin has been subject to several international sanctions, including those imposed by the United States, the European Union, and the United Kingdom. The sanctions have been imposed in response to his involvement in the Wagner Group and the IRA, as well as his alleged role in the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nU.S. Criminal Charges\n----------------------\n\nIn 2018, Prigozhin was indicted by a US grand jury on charges of conspiracy to defraud the United States. The indictment alleged that Prigozhin had been involved in a plot to interfere in the 2016 US presidential election. Prigozhin has denied any wrongdoing, although he has acknowledged that he was involved in the IRA.\n\nFinancial Support for Maria Butina in 2019\n------------------------------------------\n\nIn 2019, it was reported that Prigozhin had provided financial support to Maria Butina, a Russian spy who had been convicted of infiltrating the National Rifle Association (NRA). Prigozhin's involvement in Butina's case has been widely reported, although he has denied any direct connection to her.\n\nPersonal Life\n-------------\n\nPrigozhin is married with two children. He is a resident of Saint Petersburg, although he has spent significant amounts of time abroad, including in Africa and the Middle East. Prigozhin is known for his love of luxury cars and high-end jewelry, although he has also been involved in several charitable ventures, including the support of Russian veterans.\n\nDeath\n------\n\nOn August 23, 2023, Prigozhin was killed in a plane crash in Tver Oblast, Russia. The crash occurred on a private plane that was carrying Prigozhin and several other passengers. The cause of the crash is currently under investigation.\n\nAwards\n--------\n\nPrigozhin has received several awards for his service to the Russian state, including the Order of Courage and the Order of Friendship. He has also been recognized for his charitable work, including his support of Russian veterans.\n\nMemorials\n------------\n\nA memorial service was held for Prigozhin in Saint Petersburg, although it was not attended by any high-ranking Russian officials. Prigozhin's death has been widely reported in the Russian media, although the official cause of the plane crash remains unclear.\n\nSee Also\n------------\n\n* Wagner Group\n* Internet Research Agency\n* Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections\n* Maria Butina\n* Vladimir Putin\n\nNotes\n----------\n\nThis article is based on publicly available information and has not been verified by any official sources.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nThis article does not include any references or citations.\n\nExternal Links\n---------------\n\n* Concord Management and Consulting\n* Wagner Group\n* Internet Research Agency", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Yevgeny_Prigozhin\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and education\n##Criminal history and imprisonment\n#Early career and rise to prominence\n#Wagner Group\n##Russian invasion of Ukraine\n##Conflict with Russian Ministry of Defense\n##Prigozhin as a populist critic\n##June 2023 rebellion\n#Africa interests\n#Internet Research Agency\n##Spin-offs\n#International sanctions\n#U.S. criminal charges\n#Financial support for Maria Butina in 2019\n#Personal life\n#Death\n#Awards\n#Memorials\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He was a prominent figure in the Democratic Party and played a key role in shaping the party's policies and ideology. Jackson's presidency was marked by significant events, including the Indian Removal Act, the Nullification Crisis, and the Bank War. He is also known for his strong personality, his commitment to the principles of democracy, and his advocacy for the common man.\n\nEarly Life and Education\n------------------------\n\nAndrew Jackson was born on March 15, 1767, in the Waxhaws region on the border of North and South Carolina. His parents, Andrew and Elizabeth Jackson, were Scottish-Irish immigrants who had settled in the colonies. Jackson's father died before his birth, and his mother raised him and his two older brothers, Hugh and Robert. The family lived in a small cabin and struggled to make ends meet.\n\nJackson's education was limited, and he attended local schools in the Waxhaws region. However, he was an avid reader and developed a strong interest in history, literature, and politics. In his teens, Jackson worked as a store clerk and later as a surveyor's assistant.\n\nRevolutionary War\n-----------------\n\nDuring the American Revolutionary War, Jackson's family supported the patriot cause. In 1780, at the age of 13, Jackson joined the Continental Army as a messenger and courier. He saw action in several battles, including the Battle of Hanging Rock and the Battle of Eutaw Springs. Jackson's brothers, Hugh and Robert, also fought in the war, but both died of disease.\n\nIn 1781, Jackson was captured by British soldiers and held as a prisoner of war. He was released after several months and returned to his family's home. The war experience had a profound impact on Jackson, shaping his views on patriotism, duty, and the importance of a strong military.\n\nEarly Career\n-------------\n\n### Legal Career and Marriage\n\nAfter the war, Jackson studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1787. He established a law practice in Nashville, Tennessee, and quickly gained a reputation as a skilled lawyer. In 1796, Jackson married Rachel Donelson Robards, a widow with two children. The marriage was a happy one, and Rachel became Jackson's closest confidante and advisor.\n\n### Early Public Career\n\nJackson's entry into politics began in 1796, when he was elected to the Tennessee state legislature. He served in the state senate from 1797 to 1798 and later as a U.S. congressman from 1797 to 1798. Jackson's early public career was marked by his strong support for the Democratic-Republican Party and his advocacy for states' rights.\n\n### Planting Career and Slavery\n\nIn the late 1790s, Jackson purchased a plantation, the Hermitage, near Nashville. He established a successful farming operation, growing cotton, tobacco, and other crops. Jackson also owned slaves, which he inherited from his father-in-law and later purchased himself. The Hermitage became a symbol of Jackson's wealth and status, and he spent much of his life expanding and improving the property.\n\n### Duel with Dickinson and Adventure with Burr\n\nIn 1806, Jackson engaged in a duel with Charles Dickinson, a wealthy planter and horse breeder. Jackson was shot in the chest, but he managed to kill Dickinson. The duel was widely publicized, and Jackson's reputation as a brave and fierce fighter was solidified.\n\nIn 1805, Jackson had a brief adventure with Aaron Burr, the former vice president of the United States. Burr had fled to the western frontier after killing Alexander Hamilton in a duel. Jackson and Burr formed a partnership, and Jackson invested in several of Burr's business ventures. However, their relationship ended abruptly when Burr was arrested and charged with treason.\n\nMilitary Career\n----------------\n\n### War of 1812\n\nDuring the War of 1812, Jackson served as a major general in the Tennessee militia. He saw action in several battles, including the Battle of New Orleans, where he led a successful defense of the city against a large British army.\n\n#### Creek War\n\nIn 1813, Jackson led a campaign against the Creek Nation, a powerful Native American tribe that had allied itself with the British. Jackson's forces defeated the Creeks at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend, and the tribe was forced to cede large tracts of land to the United States.\n\n#### Battle of New Orleans\n\nThe Battle of New Orleans was a decisive victory for Jackson and the American forces. On January 8, 1815, Jackson's troops defeated a large British army, inflicting heavy casualties and forcing the British to retreat. The battle was a turning point in the war, and Jackson's reputation as a skilled military commander was solidified.\n\n### First Seminole War\n\nIn 1817, Jackson led a campaign against the Seminole tribe, which had been raiding American settlements in Florida. Jackson's forces defeated the Seminoles, and the tribe was forced to cede large tracts of land to the United States.\n\nPresidential Aspirations\n-------------------------\n\n### Election of 1824\n\nIn 1824, Jackson ran for president, but he lost to John Quincy Adams in a contentious election. Jackson's supporters claimed that the election was stolen, and they vowed to return to the campaign trail in 1828.\n\n### Election of 1828 and Death of Rachel Jackson\n\nIn 1828, Jackson ran for president again, and this time he won a decisive victory. However, the campaign was marked by tragedy when Jackson's wife, Rachel, died of a heart attack just days before the election.\n\nPresidency (1829–1837)\n----------------------\n\n### Inauguration\n\nJackson's inauguration was a tumultuous affair, with large crowds of supporters and opponents clashing in the streets. Jackson's speech was brief, but he emphasized his commitment to democracy and the principles of the American Revolution.\n\n### Reforms and Rotation in Office\n\nJackson implemented several reforms during his presidency, including the creation of a new cabinet department, the Department of Indian Affairs. He also introduced a system of rotation in office, where government officials were limited to a single term.\n\n### Petticoat Affair\n\nThe Petticoat Affair was a scandal that engulfed Jackson's administration in 1831. The affair involved a young woman, Margaret Eaton, who was accused of having an affair with a government official. Jackson's supporters defended Eaton, while his opponents attacked her. The affair ultimately led to the resignation of several cabinet members.\n\n### Indian Removal Act\n\nThe Indian Removal Act was a landmark piece of legislation that authorized the forced relocation of Native American tribes from their ancestral lands to Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma). Jackson signed the bill into law in 1830, and it led to the Trail of Tears, a brutal and devastating forced march that killed thousands of Native Americans.\n\n### Nullification Crisis\n\nThe Nullification Crisis was a constitutional crisis that threatened the unity of the United States. In 1832, South Carolina nullified a federal tariff, claiming that it was unconstitutional. Jackson responded by issuing a proclamation that asserted the authority of the federal government. The crisis was ultimately resolved when Congress passed a compromise bill that reduced the tariff.\n\n### Bank War and Election of 1832\n\n#### Bank Veto\n\nIn 1832, Jackson vetoed a bill that would have rechartered the Second Bank of the United States. The bank was a powerful institution that had been established by Congress to stabilize the national currency. Jackson opposed the bank, claiming that it was unconstitutional and favored the wealthy.\n\n#### Election of 1832\n\nIn 1832, Jackson ran for re-election, and he won a decisive victory. His opponent, Henry Clay, was a strong supporter of the bank, and the election was seen as a referendum on the bank's future.\n\n#### Removal of Deposits and Censure\n\nAfter the election, Jackson removed government deposits from the bank and placed them in state banks. The move was seen as a victory for Jackson's supporters, but it was also widely criticized. In 1834, the Senate censured Jackson for his actions, but the censure was later expunged.\n\n#### Panic of 1837\n\nThe Panic of 1837 was a severe economic downturn that occurred during Jackson's presidency. The panic was caused by a combination of factors, including a decline in agricultural prices and a contraction in credit. The panic lasted for several years, and it had a devastating impact on the economy.\n\n### Physical Assault and Assassination Attempt\n\nIn 1835, Jackson was the target of an assassination attempt. A man named Richard Lawrence attempted to shoot Jackson, but both of his pistols misfired. Jackson was shaken but unharmed.\n\n### Slavery\n\nJackson was a slave owner, and he supported the institution of slavery. However, he also opposed the expansion of slavery into new territories and states.\n\n### Foreign Affairs\n\nDuring his presidency, Jackson oversaw several significant foreign policy initiatives, including the negotiation of a treaty with Great Britain that established the border between the United States and British North America (present-day Canada).\n\n### Judiciary\n\nJackson appointed several justices to the Supreme Court, including Roger Taney, who would later become chief justice.\n\n### States Admitted to the Union\n\nDuring Jackson's presidency, two new states were admitted to the Union: Arkansas and Michigan.\n\nLater Life and Death (1837–1845)\n---------------------------------\n\nAfter leaving office, Jackson returned to the Hermitage, where he lived out the remainder of his life. He died on June 8, 1845, at the age of 78.\n\nPersonal Life\n-------------\n\n### Family\n\nJackson's family was very important to him. He was particularly close to his wife, Rachel, and he was devastated by her death. Jackson also had several nieces and nephews whom he raised as his own.\n\n### Temperament\n\nJackson was known for his strong personality and his quick temper.

The outbreak produced a total of 83 tornadoes, with the majority occurring on April 5 and 6. The event affected several states, including Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and the Carolinas. The outbreak caused significant damage and loss of life, with the hardest-hit areas being in Texas, Oklahoma, and Georgia.\n\n# Meteorological Synopsis\n\nThe tornado outbreak sequence was fueled by a powerful low-pressure system that developed over the Rocky Mountains on April 3. The system moved eastward, bringing a strong cold front and a dry line that intersected over the Southern Plains. This intersection created a highly unstable atmosphere, with warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico colliding with cool, dry air from Canada.\n\n## April 4–5\n\nOn April 4, a line of thunderstorms developed along the dry line, producing several tornadoes in Texas and Oklahoma. The storms intensified overnight, with a significant tornado outbreak occurring on April 5. The outbreak produced 43 tornadoes, with the majority occurring in Texas and Oklahoma. The tornadoes caused significant damage and loss of life, with several communities being severely impacted.\n\n## April 6–7\n\nOn April 6, the low-pressure system moved eastward, bringing the cold front and dry line into the Southeast. A new round of thunderstorms developed, producing several tornadoes in Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. The storms intensified overnight, with a significant tornado outbreak occurring on April 7. The outbreak produced 25 tornadoes, with the majority occurring in Georgia and the Carolinas. The tornadoes caused significant damage and loss of life, with several communities being severely impacted.\n\n# Confirmed Tornadoes\n\nA total of 83 tornadoes were confirmed during the outbreak sequence.\n\n## April 4 Event\n\n* 5 tornadoes occurred in Texas and Oklahoma, causing significant damage and loss of life.\n\n## April 5 Event\n\n* 43 tornadoes occurred in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Louisiana, causing widespread damage and loss of life.\n* The tornadoes included several long-track tornadoes, with one tornado traveling over 100 miles.\n\n## April 6 Event\n\n* 10 tornadoes occurred in Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi, causing significant damage and loss of life.\n\n## April 7 Event\n\n* 25 tornadoes occurred in Georgia, the Carolinas, and Alabama, causing widespread damage and loss of life.\n* The tornadoes included several long-track tornadoes, with one tornado traveling over 50 miles.\n\n## Pembroke–Ellabell–Black Creek, Georgia\n\nA devastating EF4 tornado occurred in Pembroke, Ellabell, and Black Creek, Georgia, causing significant damage and loss of life. The tornado had winds of up to 170 mph and traveled over 20 miles.\n\n# Non-Tornadic Impacts\n\nIn addition to the tornadoes, the outbreak sequence produced significant non-tornadic impacts, including:\n\n* Heavy rain: Several areas received over 4 inches of rain, causing flash flooding and significant disruptions.\n* Hail: Several areas experienced large hail, causing significant damage to crops and property.\n* Strong winds: Several areas experienced strong winds, causing significant damage to trees and power lines.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe tornado outbreak sequence caused significant damage and loss of life, with several communities being severely impacted. The aftermath of the event saw a significant response from emergency management officials, with search and rescue efforts being conducted in several areas. The event also saw a significant response from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), with several areas being declared disaster zones.\n\n# See Also\n\n* List of tornadoes in the United States\n* Tornado outbreak sequence\n* Tornado\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a factual account of the tornado outbreak sequence of April 4–7, 2022.

{"title": "Malahai", "content": "#Etymology\n#Design and materials\n#In Russia\n#See also\n#Explanatory notes\n", "lang": "en", "article": "# Malahai\n\nMalahai is a traditional type of axe originating from Eastern Europe, particularly in Russia and Ukraine. It has a long history and has been used for various purposes, including woodcutting, hunting, and even as a tool for self-defense. The malahai has a distinctive design and is made from high-quality materials, making it a reliable and efficient tool for many tasks.\n\n# Etymology\n\nThe word \"malahai\" is derived from the Russian language, and its etymology is closely tied to the history of axe-making in Eastern Europe. The term \"malahai\" is believed to have originated from the word \"malakai,\" which refers to a type of axe used for chopping wood. Over time, the term \"malahai\" became more widely used and was adopted into other languages, including Ukrainian and Polish.\n\n## Evolution of the term\n\nThe term \"malahai\" has undergone significant changes throughout its history. In ancient times, the term referred to a specific type of axe used for chopping wood, but it later came to be used to describe a wider range of axes. The term also took on cultural and symbolic meanings, representing strength, resilience, and independence.\n\n# Design and materials\n\nThe design of the malahai is characterized by its curved or angled blade, typically made from high-carbon steel. The handle is usually made from durable wood, such as ash or oak, and is often wrapped with leather or metal for added grip and protection.\n\n## Blade design\n\nThe blade of the malahai is its most distinctive feature, with a curved or angled shape that allows for effective chopping and cutting. The blade is typically between 6 and 12 inches in length and is sharpened to a fine edge. The curved shape of the blade also allows for a more efficient transfer of force, making it easier to chop through wood and other materials.\n\n## Handle design\n\nThe handle of the malahai is typically made from durable wood and is designed to provide a comfortable and secure grip. The handle is often wrapped with leather or metal, which helps to prevent slipping and provides added protection. The handle is also designed to be balanced, allowing for smooth and controlled movements.\n\n## Materials\n\nThe materials used to make the malahai are of the highest quality, with high-carbon steel used for the blade and durable wood used for the handle. The use of high-quality materials ensures that the malahai is reliable and efficient, and can withstand heavy use.\n\n# In Russia\n\nThe malahai has a long history in Russia, where it was used for various purposes, including woodcutting, hunting, and even as a tool for self-defense. The malahai was an essential tool for Russian peasants, who used it to chop wood for fuel and to clear land for farming.\n\n## Traditional uses\n\nThe malahai was traditionally used for a variety of tasks, including woodcutting, hunting, and self-defense. Russian peasants used the malahai to chop wood for fuel, to clear land for farming, and to hunt for food. The malahai was also used as a tool for self-defense, particularly during times of conflict.\n\n## Cultural significance\n\nThe malahai has significant cultural and symbolic meaning in Russia, representing strength, resilience, and independence. The malahai is often featured in Russian folklore and is seen as a symbol of Russian identity. The malahai is also used in traditional Russian ceremonies and is often given as a gift to mark important occasions.\n\n# See also\n\n* Axe\n* Tomahawk\n* Hatchet\n* Woodcutting\n* Hunting\n\n# Explanatory notes\n\nThe malahai is a traditional type of axe that has a long history in Eastern Europe, particularly in Russia and Ukraine.

The region has a complex and tumultuous history, with various empires and nations vying for control over the centuries. This article will explore the events surrounding the formation and dissolution of the Republic of Crimea.\n\n# Crimean ASSR\n\nThe Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (ASSR) was a autonomous republic within the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) from 1921 to 1945, and then within the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (USSR) from 1945 to 1991. During its existence, the Crimean ASSR had a significant degree of autonomy, with its own government and laws. However, the region's proximity to the Black Sea and its strategic importance made it a coveted prize for various powers.\n\n## Soviet Era\n\nDuring the Soviet era, the Crimean ASSR was a major tourist destination, with its warm climate, beautiful beaches, and historic landmarks attracting millions of visitors each year. The region was also home to a significant military presence, with numerous naval bases and military installations. The Soviet government invested heavily in the region's infrastructure, building roads, bridges, and public buildings.\n\n## Perestroika and Glasnost\n\nAs the Soviet Union began to liberalize under the policies of perestroika and glasnost, the Crimean ASSR began to assert its autonomy. In 1990, the region's parliament, the Supreme Soviet of Crimea, declared the region's sovereignty and began to push for greater independence from the USSR.\n\n# Name change in 1992\n\nIn 1992, the Supreme Soviet of Crimea renamed the region the Republic of Crimea, dropping the \"Autonomous Soviet Socialist\" part of its name. This move was seen as a significant step towards independence, and was greeted with enthusiasm by many Crimeans.\n\n## Declaration of Independence\n\nOn May 5, 1992, the Supreme Soviet of Crimea declared the region's independence from the USSR and the Ukrainian SSR. The declaration was met with opposition from the Ukrainian government, which saw the move as a threat to its sovereignty.\n\n## International Recognition\n\nThe Republic of Crimea was not recognized as a sovereign state by the international community. The Ukrainian government, backed by the United States and other Western powers, refused to recognize the region's independence. The Russian government, which had significant economic and military interests in the region, also refused to recognize the Republic of Crimea.\n\n# Relations with Ukraine\n\nThe relations between the Republic of Crimea and Ukraine were tense and complex. The Ukrainian government saw the region's declaration of independence as a threat to its sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Crimean government, on the other hand, saw Ukraine as a colonial power that was trying to suppress the region's autonomy.\n\n## Economic Ties\n\nDespite the tensions, the Republic of Crimea remained economically tied to Ukraine. The region relied heavily on Ukraine for trade, investment, and energy supplies. The Ukrainian government used its economic leverage to try to persuade the Crimean government to abandon its independence bid.\n\n## Military Tensions\n\nThe relations between the Republic of Crimea and Ukraine were also marked by military tensions. The Crimean government had its own military forces, which were largely made up of former Soviet soldiers. The Ukrainian government saw the region's military as a threat to its security and began to build up its own military presence in the region.\n\n# Relations with Russia\n\nThe relations between the Republic of Crimea and Russia were complex and multifaceted. The Russian government had significant economic and military interests in the region, and was seen as a key player in the region's politics.\n\n## Economic Ties\n\nThe Republic of Crimea had significant economic ties with Russia. The region relied heavily on Russia for trade, investment, and energy supplies. The Russian government used its economic leverage to try to influence the region's politics and persuade the Crimean government to abandon its independence bid.\n\n## Military Ties\n\nThe Republic of Crimea had significant military ties with Russia. The region's military forces were largely made up of former Soviet soldiers, and the Russian government provided the region with military aid and training. The Ukrainian government saw the region's military ties with Russia as a threat to its security.\n\n# Name change in 1995\n\nIn 1995, the Ukrainian government and the Crimean government reached an agreement that saw the region's name changed back to the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. The agreement also saw the region's autonomy reduced, with the Ukrainian government gaining greater control over the region's politics and economy.\n\n## Constitutional Reform\n\nThe agreement was followed by constitutional reform, which saw the region's constitution rewritten to reduce the region's autonomy. The reform also saw the region's military forces disbanded and the Ukrainian government gain greater control over the region's economy.\n\n# See also\n\n* Crimean ASSR\n* Autonomous Republic of Crimea\n* Ukraine\n* Russia\n* Black Sea\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a neutral, encyclopedic account of the Republic of Crimea (1992–1995).

After quitting his job, Ballard forms Operation Underground Railroad (O.U.R.) and assembles a team of former CIA operatives, law enforcement officers, and other experts to help him rescue children from sex traffickers.\n\nThe film takes the audience on a journey as Ballard and his team travel to different countries, including Colombia and Thailand, to rescue children from sex traffickers. Along the way, Ballard faces numerous challenges, including resistance from corrupt government officials, danger from traffickers, and personal struggles with his own faith and family.\n\nThroughout the film, Ballard's character grapples with the moral implications of his work and the toll it takes on his personal life. He also experiences moments of spiritual awakening and rededication to his mission. The film ultimately ends on a hopeful note, with Ballard and his team successfully rescuing numerous children and bringing them to safety.\n\n# Cast\n\n* Jim Caviezel as Tim Ballard\n* Mira Sorvino as Katherine Ballard\n* Bill Camp as Norm\n* José Zúñiga as Javier\n* Eduardo Verástegui as Paul\n* Gustavo Quiroz as Jorge\n\n# Production\n\n## Development\n\nThe film was developed in collaboration with Tim Ballard and the team at Operation Underground Railroad (O.U.R.). The screenplay was written by Alejandro Monteverde and Rodney Romero, with input from Ballard and other experts in the field of anti-human trafficking.\n\n## Filming\n\nPrincipal photography took place in various locations, including Mexico, Colombia, and Thailand. The film was shot on location in an effort to accurately depict the environments and cultures in which the story takes place.\n\n## Distribution\n\nThe film was distributed by Angel Studios, a streaming platform that specializes in faith-based and family-friendly content. The film was released in theaters in 2019 and later made available on streaming platforms.\n\n## Accuracy\n\nThe film is based on real events and draws heavily from the experiences of Tim Ballard and the team at Operation Underground Railroad (O.U.R.). However, some artistic liberties were taken to enhance the storytelling and characters. The film's accuracy has been praised by experts in the field of anti-human trafficking, who have noted that it accurately depicts the complexities and challenges of combating child sex trafficking.\n\n# Connections to QAnon conspiracy theories\n\nThe film's release coincided with the rise of QAnon conspiracy theories, which have been linked to anti-human trafficking efforts. Some QAnon supporters have praised the film as a validation of their theories, while others have criticized it for its perceived ties to the conspiracy movement.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that the film's creators and Tim Ballard himself have distanced themselves from QAnon conspiracy theories. Ballard has stated that he is not affiliated with the QAnon movement and that his work is focused on combating human trafficking through legitimate and evidence-based means.\n\n# Pay-it-forward scheme\n\nThe film's creators implemented a pay-it-forward scheme, which allowed viewers to purchase tickets for others to see the film for free. This initiative was designed to help raise awareness about human trafficking and to support the work of Operation Underground Railroad (O.U.R.).\n\n# Reception\n\n## Critical response\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising its powerful storytelling and others criticizing its heavy-handed approach to faith and morality. The film holds a 40% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 22 reviews, with an average rating of 5.2/10.\n\n## Box office\n\nThe film performed modestly at the box office, grossing over $2 million in its opening weekend. It went on to gross over $5 million worldwide.\n\n## Audience reception and faith-based appeal\n\nDespite mixed critical reviews, the film resonated with audiences, particularly those in the faith-based community. The film's themes of faith, redemption, and the power of the human spirit struck a chord with many viewers, who praised the film for its inspiring and uplifting message.\n\n## Endorsements and special screening\n\nThe film received endorsements from several high-profile faith leaders and anti-human trafficking advocates, including Tony Evans and Christine Caine. The film was also screened at several special events, including a premiere at the White House.\n\n## Accolades\n\nThe film won several awards at faith-based film festivals, including the ICVM Crown Award for Best Picture and the Christian Worldview Film Festival's Best Picture award.\n\n# References\n\n# External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Sound_of_Freedom_(film)\" following this outline:\n\n#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production\n##Development\n##Filming\n##Distribution\n##Accuracy\n#Connections to QAnon conspiracy theories\n#Pay-it-forward scheme\n#Reception\n##Critical response\n##Box office\n##Audience reception and faith-based appeal\n##Endorsements and special screening\n##Accolades\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The season began on March 16, 2023, and concluded on September 30, 2023. Eighteen teams competed in the league, with each team playing 23 matches during the home-and-away season.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe 2023 season saw several rule changes, including the introduction of a \"sin bin\" system for players who commit serious breaches of the rules. The system, which was trialed in the pre-season, allows umpires to send players off the field for 10 minutes for certain types of misconduct. The season also saw the introduction of a new fixture format, with each team playing six matches against teams from their own conference and five matches against teams from the other conference.\n\n**Coach appointments**\n\nSeveral teams underwent coaching changes during the off-season. The most notable appointment was that of Alastair Clarkson, who took over as senior coach of the North Melbourne Football Club. Clarkson, who had previously coached the Hawthorn Football Club to four premierships, replaced David Noble, who was sacked at the end of the 2022 season. Other coaching changes included the appointment of Craig McRae as senior coach of the Collingwood Football Club and the appointment of Adam Kingsley as senior coach of the St Kilda Football Club.\n\n**Club leadership**\n\nSeveral clubs underwent leadership changes during the off-season. The most notable change was at the Richmond Football Club, where Trent Cotchin stepped down as captain after 10 years in the role. Cotchin was replaced by Dylan Grimes and Toby Nankervis, who will share the captaincy for the 2023 season. Other leadership changes included the appointment of Jarryd Lyons as co-captain of the Brisbane Lions and the appointment of Max Gawn as sole captain of the Melbourne Football Club.\n\n**Pre-season**\n\nThe pre-season competition began on February 16, 2023, and concluded on March 12, 2023. The competition featured 18 matches, with each team playing two matches. The pre-season was marked by several high-profile injuries, including the loss of Collingwood forward Jordan De Goey, who suffered a serious ankle injury in the Magpies' opening match.\n\n**Season events**\n\n### Increased focus on dangerous tackles\n\nThe 2023 season saw an increased focus on player safety, with the AFL introducing new rules to crack down on dangerous tackling. The new rules, which were introduced in response to a series of high-profile injuries in 2022, include stricter penalties for players who engage in rough conduct. The rules have been welcomed by players and coaches, who have praised the AFL for taking steps to protect player safety.\n\n### Hawthorn historical racism allegations\n\nThe 2023 season was marred by allegations of historical racism at the Hawthorn Football Club. The allegations, which were made by several former Indigenous players, included claims of racist abuse and cultural insensitivity.

The outbreak marked the largest and most widespread mpox outbreak outside of Africa, with cases reported in over 100 countries and territories worldwide. The rapid spread of the virus led to an increase in public health concerns, with the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on July 23, 2022.\n\n# Background\n\nThe 2022–2023 mpox outbreak was not the first instance of the virus spreading outside of Africa. However, the rapid spread of the virus in 2022 was unprecedented, and several factors contributed to the outbreak.\n\n## Emergency preparedness prior to outbreak\n\nPrior to the outbreak, several countries had implemented emergency preparedness measures to respond to potential public health crises. These measures included stockpiling vaccines and personal protective equipment (PPE), developing testing and containment protocols, and conducting regular drills and exercises. However, the mpox outbreak exposed gaps in these preparedness measures, highlighting the need for more comprehensive and coordinated responses to emerging public health threats.\n\n## Endemic mpox in Africa\n\nMpox is a zoonotic disease, meaning it can be transmitted between animals and humans. The virus is endemic in several African countries, where it is typically spread through contact with infected animals or contaminated materials. In Africa, mpox outbreaks are often contained through local public health measures, and the virus is not typically considered a significant public health threat. However, the 2022 outbreak highlighted the potential for mpox to spread beyond Africa and cause significant global health concerns.\n\n# Outbreak characteristics\n\nThe 2022–2023 mpox outbreak was characterized by several unusual features, including its rapid spread, long incubation periods, and mild clinical manifestations.\n\n## Phylogenetics\n\nPhylogenetic analysis of the virus revealed that the 2022 outbreak was caused by a strain of the monkeypox virus that was distinct from previous outbreaks. The strain was characterized by several mutations that may have contributed to its increased transmissibility.\n\n## Long incubation periods\n\nThe incubation period of the virus, which is the time between exposure to the virus and the onset of symptoms, was longer than expected. In some cases, the incubation period was as long as 21 days, making it challenging to track and contain the spread of the virus.\n\n## Mild clinical manifestations\n\nThe clinical manifestations of the virus were generally mild, with most patients experiencing symptoms such as fever, headache, and rash. However, some patients experienced more severe symptoms, including pneumonia and encephalitis.\n\n## Fear of zoonotic spread\n\nThe outbreak raised concerns about the potential for zoonotic spread of the virus, which is the transmission of the virus from animals to humans. Several cases of zoonotic transmission were reported, highlighting the need for increased surveillance and control measures to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\n# Chronology\n\nThe 2022–2023 mpox outbreak was first detected in the United Kingdom on May 6, 2022. The outbreak rapidly spread to other countries, with the first deaths reported outside of Africa in June 2022.\n\n## Deaths outside of Africa\n\nThe first deaths outside of Africa were reported in Brazil and Spain on June 22 and 23, 2022, respectively. The deaths were a significant turning point in the outbreak, highlighting the need for increased public health measures to contain the spread of the virus.\n\n# Transmission\n\nThe transmission patterns of the virus were a key factor in the rapid spread of the outbreak.\n\n## Transmission patterns\n\nThe virus was primarily spread through close contact with an infected person, including skin-to-skin contact, respiratory droplets, and contaminated materials. The virus was also spread through sexual contact, highlighting the need for increased surveillance and control measures in high-risk populations.\n\n## Wastewater surveillance\n\nWastewater surveillance was used to track the spread of the virus in several countries. The surveillance revealed that the virus was present in wastewater samples, highlighting the need for increased public health measures to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\n# Interventions\n\nSeveral interventions were implemented to contain the spread of the virus, including testing and containment protocols, vaccination, and public health education campaigns.\n\n## Testing and containment\n\nTesting and containment protocols were implemented to identify and isolate infected individuals. The protocols included contact tracing, testing, and isolation of infected individuals, as well as quarantine measures for high-risk contacts.\n\n## Vaccination\n\nVaccination was a key intervention in the outbreak, with several countries implementing vaccination campaigns to protect high-risk populations.

His contributions to various fields, including number theory, algebra, geometry, and astronomy, have had a lasting impact on the development of mathematics and science.\n\n# Biography\n\n## Youth and education\n\nGauss was born on April 30, 1777, in Braunschweig, Germany, to a poor family. His father was a bricklayer and a gardener, and his mother was an illiterate woman who had a significant influence on Gauss's early education. Gauss's exceptional mathematical abilities were recognized at an early age, and he began attending the local elementary school at the age of three. In 1788, he entered the Martino-Katharineum, a prestigious secondary school in Braunschweig, where he excelled in mathematics and languages.\n\n## Private scholar\n\nAfter completing his secondary education, Gauss's parents wanted him to become a merchant, but Gauss's interests lay in mathematics. In 1795, he began studying mathematics at the University of Göttingen, where he was heavily influenced by the works of Leonhard Euler and Joseph-Louis Lagrange. However, Gauss did not attend classes regularly, preferring to study on his own. During this period, he made significant contributions to number theory, including the discovery of the prime number theorem.\n\n## Professor in Göttingen\n\nIn 1807, Gauss was appointed as the director of the astronomical observatory at the University of Göttingen, a position he held until his death. He became a professor of astronomy and mathematics in 1810 and was granted a lifetime appointment in 1824. During his tenure, Gauss made significant contributions to astronomy, including the discovery of the asteroid Ceres and the development of a new method for calculating orbits.\n\n## Gauss's brain\n\nAfter Gauss's death, his brain was preserved and studied by the neurologist Rudolf Wagner, who discovered that Gauss's brain was unusual in several respects. The brain was found to have a highly developed cerebral cortex, which is responsible for higher-order thinking, and an unusually high number of glial cells, which provide support and protection to neurons. These findings have been interpreted as evidence of Gauss's exceptional cognitive abilities.\n\n## Family\n\nGauss married Johanna Osthoff in 1805, and they had two sons, Joseph and Wilhelm. After Johanna's death in 1809, Gauss married Minna Waldeck in 1810, and they had three children together. Gauss's family life was marked by tragedy, including the death of his first wife and his daughter, who died in infancy.\n\n## Personality\n\n### Scholar\n\nGauss was known for his intense focus and dedication to his work. He was a perfectionist who was deeply committed to his research and was willing to spend years working on a single problem. Gauss was also known for his exceptional memory and his ability to perform complex calculations in his head.\n\n### Private man\n\nDespite his fame and reputation, Gauss was a private person who preferred to avoid publicity. He was known to be humble and unassuming, and he rarely sought to draw attention to himself. Gauss was also a kind and generous person who was deeply committed to his family and friends.\n\n# Scientific work\n\n## Algebra and number theory\n\n### Fundamental theorem of algebra\n\nGauss's most famous contribution to algebra is the fundamental theorem of algebra, which states that every polynomial equation has at least one complex root. This theorem, which was first proved by Gauss in 1799, has far-reaching implications for many areas of mathematics and science.\n\n### Disquisitiones Arithmeticae\n\nGauss's magnum opus is the Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, a comprehensive treatise on number theory that was published in 1801. This work, which covers topics such as congruences, quadratic forms, and the theory of numbers, is considered one of the greatest works of mathematics ever written.\n\n### Further investigations\n\nGauss made many other significant contributions to algebra and number theory, including the development of the theory of elliptic curves and the discovery of the prime number theorem. He also worked on the theory of modular forms and the study of the distribution of prime numbers.\n\n## Analysis\n\n### Numeric analysis\n\nGauss made significant contributions to the field of numeric analysis, including the development of the method of least squares and the invention of the Gaussian distribution. He also worked on the theory of interpolation and the study of the convergence of series.\n\n## Chronology\n\nGauss's work on chronology, which is the study of the measurement of time, led to the development of a new method for calculating the date of Easter. This method, which is still used today, is based on the lunar cycle and the solar year.\n\n## Astronomy\n\nGauss made many significant contributions to astronomy, including the discovery of the asteroid Ceres and the development of a new method for calculating orbits. He also worked on the study of the motion of the planets and the theory of the tides.\n\n## Theory of errors\n\nGauss's work on the theory of errors, which is the study of the measurement of uncertainty, led to the development of the Gaussian distribution. This distribution, which is also known as the bell curve, is a fundamental concept in statistics and is used to model many types of data.\n\n## Arc measurement and geodetic survey\n\nGauss made significant contributions to the field of geodesy, including the development of a new method for measuring the arc of a meridian. He also worked on the study of the shape of the Earth and the theory of the tides.\n\n## Differential geometry\n\nGauss's work on differential geometry, which is the study of the properties of curves and surfaces, led to the development of the Gaussian curvature. This concept, which is a measure of the curvature of a surface, is a fundamental concept in mathematics and physics.\n\n## Non-Euclidean geometry\n\nGauss's work on non-Euclidean geometry, which is the study of geometries that are not based on the principles of Euclid, led to the development of the theory of hyperbolic geometry. This theory, which is a fundamental concept in mathematics and physics, is used to model many types of spaces.\n\n## Early topology\n\nGauss's work on topology, which is the study of the properties of shapes and spaces, led to the development of the theory of knots and links. This theory, which is a fundamental concept in mathematics and physics, is used to model many types of spaces.\n\n## Minor mathematical accomplishments\n\nGauss made many other significant contributions to mathematics, including the development of the theory of binary quadratic forms and the study of the properties of the number e.\n\n## Magnetism and telegraphy\n\n### Geomagnetism\n\nGauss's work on geomagnetism, which is the study of the Earth's magnetic field, led to the development of a new method for measuring the strength of the magnetic field. He also worked on the study of the variation of the magnetic field over time.\n\n### Electromagnetism\n\nGauss's work on electromagnetism, which is the study of the interaction between electric and magnetic fields, led to the development of the theory of the electromagnetic field. This theory, which is a fundamental concept in physics, is used to model many types of phenomena.\n\n## Potential theory\n\nGauss's work on potential theory, which is the study of the properties of gravitational and electric fields, led to the development of the theory of the gravitational potential. This theory, which is a fundamental concept in physics, is used to model many types of phenomena.\n\n## Optics\n\nGauss's work on optics, which is the study of the properties of light, led to the development of the theory of the optical system. This theory, which is a fundamental concept in physics, is used to model many types of optical systems.\n\n## Mechanics\n\nGauss's work on mechanics, which is the study of the properties of motion, led to the development of the theory of the motion of rigid bodies. This theory, which is a fundamental concept in physics, is used to model many types of motion.\n\n## Metrology\n\nGauss's work on metrology, which is the study of the measurement of physical quantities, led to the development of a new method for measuring the length of a meridian. He also worked on the study of the measurement of the properties of materials.\n\n# Anecdotes\n\nGauss was known for his exceptional memory and his ability to perform complex calculations in his head. One famous anecdote tells of how Gauss, as a young boy, was able to calculate the sum of the first 100 positive integers in his head. When asked how he did it, Gauss replied that he had noticed that the sum was equal to 50 times the average of the first and last numbers.\n\n# Honours and awards\n\nGauss received many honors and awards during his lifetime, including the Copley Medal, which is the most prestigious award in science. He was also elected as a member of many scientific societies, including the Royal Society and the French Academy of Sciences.\n\n# Names and commemorations\n\nGauss's name has been commemorated in many ways, including the naming of the Gaussian distribution, the Gaussian curvature, and the Gauss crater on the Moon. He has also been honored with many statues and monuments, including a statue in his hometown of Braunschweig.\n\n# Selected writings\n\n## Mathematics and astronomy\n\nGauss's most famous works include the Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, the Astronomische Nachrichten, and the Theoria motus corporum coelestium.\n\n## Physics\n\n### Together with Wilhelm Weber\n\nGauss and Wilhelm Weber collaborated on many works, including the Atlas des Erdmagnetismus and the Resultate aus den Beobachtungen des magnetischen Vereins.\n\n## Collected works\n\nGauss's collected works were published in 12 volumes after his death.

It was founded in 1994 and has since become one of the most popular sports leagues in the country. The league is contested by 18 clubs and operates on a system of promotion and relegation with Liga 2, the second tier of Indonesian football.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\n### Origins\n\nThe origins of Liga 1 date back to 1979 when the Perserikatan, a semi-professional league, was established. However, the league was not well-organized, and it was eventually replaced by the Galatama, a more professional league, in 1982. The Galatama was the top league in Indonesia until 1994 when it was replaced by the Liga Indonesia.\n\n### Foundation\n\nThe Liga Indonesia was founded in 1994 as the top professional league in Indonesia. The league was initially contested by 34 clubs, but it was later reduced to 28 clubs in 1995. The league was divided into two divisions, with the top division featuring 18 clubs and the second division featuring 10 clubs.\n\n### Dualism\n\nIn the early 2000s, Indonesian football was plagued by dualism, with two rival leagues operating in the country. The Liga Indonesia was the official top league, but it was rivalled by the Indonesian Premier League (IPL), which was founded in 2011. The IPL was not recognized by the Football Association of Indonesia (PSSI), but it was supported by several top clubs.\n\n### Government intervention and FIFA suspension\n\nIn 2015, the Indonesian government intervened in the dispute between the PSSI and the IPL, and the PSSI was eventually suspended by FIFA. The suspension was lifted in 2016, and the PSSI was reformed.\n\n### Name change\n\nIn 2017, the Liga Indonesia was rebranded as Liga 1. The name change was made to make the league more attractive to fans and sponsors.\n\nCompetition format\n------------------\n\n### Competition\n\nLiga 1 is contested by 18 clubs, with each club playing the others twice, once at home and once away. The team with the most points at the end of the season is crowned champion.\n\n### Promotion and relegation\n\nThe bottom three clubs in Liga 1 are relegated to Liga 2, while the top three clubs in Liga 2 are promoted to Liga 1.\n\n### Video assistant referee\n\nLiga 1 has used video assistant referees (VARs) since the 2019 season. VARs are used to assist the referee in making decisions on goals, penalties, and direct red cards.\n\nClubs\n------\n\n### Champions\n\nThe following clubs have won Liga 1 since its inception in 1994:\n\n* 1994: Persib Bandung\n* 1995: Persib Bandung\n* 1996: Persib Bandung\n* 1997: Persib Bandung\n* 1998: Persija Jakarta\n* 1999: Persija Jakarta\n* 2000: Persija Jakarta\n* 2001: Persija Jakarta\n* 2002: Persita Tangerang\n* 2003: Persita Tangerang\n* 2004: Persija Jakarta\n* 2005: Persija Jakarta\n* 2006: Persik Kediri\n* 2007: Sriwijaya FC\n* 2008: Sriwijaya FC\n* 2009: Persija Jakarta\n* 2010: Sriwijaya FC\n* 2011: Persija Jakarta\n* 2012: Sriwijaya FC\n* 2013: Persib Bandung\n* 2014: Persib Bandung\n* 2015: Persib Bandung\n* 2016: Persija Jakarta\n* 2017: Bhayangkara FC\n* 2018: Persija Jakarta\n* 2019: Bali United\n* 2020: Persija Jakarta\n\n### Performance by clubs\n\nThe following table shows the performance of each club in Liga 1 since its inception in 1994:\n\n| Club | Titles | Runners-up | Third place |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Persija Jakarta | 11 | 6 | 3 |\n| Persib Bandung | 9 | 4 | 2 |\n| Sriwijaya FC | 4 | 2 | 1 |\n| Persita Tangerang | 2 | 1 | 0 |\n| Persik Kediri | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n| Bhayangkara FC | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n| Bali United | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n\n### 2024–25 season\n\nThe following clubs will compete in Liga 1 in the 2024–25 season:\n\n* Arema FC\n* Bali United\n* Barito Putera\n* Bhayangkara FC\n* Borneo FC\n* Dewa United\n* Madura United\n* Mitra Kukar\n* Persebaya Surabaya\n* Persib Bandung\n* Persija Jakarta\n* Persik Kediri\n* Persita Tangerang\n* Persita Tangerang\n* PSIS Semarang\n* PSM Makassar\n* PSS Sleman\n* RANS Nusantara\n\n#### Maps\n\nA map of the teams competing in Liga 1 in the 2024–25 season can be found here.\n\n### Former clubs\n\nThe following clubs have competed in Liga 1 in the past:\n\n* Arema Cronus (now Arema FC)\n* Gresik United\n* Mitra Kukar (now defunct)\n* Persela Lamongan\n* Perseru Serui\n* Persiwa Wamena\n* Persijap Jepara\n* PSAP Sigli\n* PSDS Deli Serdang\n\n### All-time Liga 1 table\n\nThe following table shows the all-time Liga 1 table since its inception in 1994:\n\n| Club | Seasons | Points | Matches | Wins | Draws | Losses |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Persija Jakarta | 27 | 1,444 | 944 | 445 | 244 | 255 |\n| Persib Bandung | 27 | 1,381 | 944 | 424 | 239 | 281 |\n| Sriwijaya FC | 20 | 944 | 676 | 285 | 184 | 207 |\n| Persita Tangerang | 20 | 841 | 676 | 247 | 181 | 248 |\n| Persik Kediri | 17 | 734 | 586 | 223 | 165 | 198 |\n| Bhayangkara FC | 10 | 542 | 340 | 164 | 100 | 76 |\n| Bali United | 9 | 446 | 306 | 136 | 94 | 76 |\n\nForeign players\n---------------\n\nLiga 1 allows each club to sign a maximum of 5 foreign players.

The film is a dramatized account of the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the director of the Manhattan Project, which developed the atomic bomb during World War II.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe film follows Oppenheimer's journey from his early days as a physicist to his appointment as the director of the Manhattan Project. It explores his complex relationships with his colleagues, including Enrico Fermi, Ernest Lawrence, and Edward Teller, as well as his personal struggles with anxiety and depression. The film also delves into the moral implications of developing the atomic bomb and the devastating consequences of its use on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\n# Cast\n\nThe film boasts an ensemble cast, including:\n\n* Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer\n* Emily Blunt as Katherine \"Kitty\" Oppenheimer\n* Matt Damon as Leslie Groves\n* Robert Downey Jr. as Lewis Strauss\n* Florence Pugh as Jean Tatlock\n* Rami Malek as Lyndon B. Johnson\n* Benny Safdie as Edward Teller\n* Josh Hartnett as Ernest Lawrence\n* Dane DeHaan as Kenneth Nichols\n* Alden Ehrenreich as unknown\n\n# Production\n\n## Development\n\nChristopher Nolan had been fascinated by Oppenheimer's story for many years and had been researching his life and work since the early 2000s. Nolan wrote the screenplay for Oppenheimer in 2015, but he put the project on hold to focus on other films, including Dunkirk and Tenet. In 2020, Nolan returned to the project and began working with Syncopy Inc. and Atlas Entertainment to develop the film.\n\n## Writing\n\nNolan's screenplay for Oppenheimer is based on several books about the physicist's life, including American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Nolan also drew inspiration from Oppenheimer's own writings and interviews. The screenplay explores Oppenheimer's complex personality and his struggles with the moral implications of his work.\n\n## Casting\n\nCasting for Oppenheimer began in 2020, with Cillian Murphy being the first actor to be cast in the title role. Emily Blunt was cast as Oppenheimer's wife, Katherine, in 2021, followed by Matt Damon as Leslie Groves and Robert Downey Jr. as Lewis Strauss. The rest of the cast was announced throughout 2022.\n\n## Filming\n\nPrincipal photography for Oppenheimer began in February 2022 and lasted for several months. The film was shot on location in various places, including New Mexico, California, and New York. Nolan worked with his longtime collaborator, cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema, to capture the film's complex and nuanced visuals.\n\n## Post-production\n\nPost-production for Oppenheimer began in the summer of 2022 and lasted for several months. Nolan worked with his editor, Jennifer Lame, to assemble the film's complex narrative. The film's visual effects were created by a team of artists led by Andrew Jackson.\n\n# Music\n\nThe score for Oppenheimer was composed by Ludwig Göransson, who had previously worked with Nolan on Tenet. Göransson's score is a complex and nuanced blend of orchestral and choral music, reflecting the film's themes of science, morality, and humanity.\n\n# Marketing\n\nThe marketing campaign for Oppenheimer began in the summer of 2022, with the release of a teaser trailer. The trailer was widely praised for its haunting and atmospheric visuals, which reflected the film's complex and nuanced tone. The full trailer was released in the fall of 2022, followed by a series of promotional posters and stills.\n\n# Release\n\n## Theatrical\n\nOppenheimer was released in theaters on July 21, 2023. The film was distributed by Universal Pictures and was released in various formats, including IMAX and Dolby Cinema.\n\n### Classifications and censorship\n\nOppenheimer was rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America for its language, violence, and some suggestive content. The film was also classified as 15 by the British Board of Film Classification for its strong language, violence, and some sex references.\n\n## Home media\n\nOppenheimer was released on digital platforms in September 2023, followed by a Blu-ray and DVD release in October 2023. The home media release included a series of bonus features, including a behind-the-scenes documentary and a commentary track by Christopher Nolan.\n\n# Reception\n\n## Box office\n\n### United States and Canada\n\nOppenheimer was a commercial success in the United States and Canada, grossing over $100 million in its opening weekend. The film went on to gross over $300 million in the United States and Canada, making it one of the highest-grossing films of 2023.\n\n### Japan\n\nOppenheimer was also a commercial success in Japan, grossing over $20 million in its opening weekend. The film went on to gross over $50 million in Japan, making it one of the highest-grossing foreign films of 2023.\n\n### Other territories\n\nOppenheimer was a commercial success in other territories, grossing over $200 million in the United Kingdom, Australia, and other countries. The film went on to gross over $500 million worldwide, making it one of the highest-grossing films of 2023.\n\n## Critical response\n\nOppenheimer received widespread critical acclaim, with many praising its complex and nuanced portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer's life and work. The film's performances, direction, and score were also widely praised. The film holds a 95% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with many critics praising its thought-provoking and emotionally resonant themes.\n\n## Influence on legislation\n\nOppenheimer's portrayal of the atomic bomb's devastating consequences led to renewed calls for disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation. The film's release coincided with a series of international summits on nuclear disarmament, and many world leaders cited the film as an inspiration for their efforts to reduce the global nuclear arsenal.\n\n# Accuracy and omissions\n\nOppenheimer has been praised for its historical accuracy and attention to detail. However, some critics have noted that the film omits certain aspects of Oppenheimer's life and work, including his relationships with other scientists and his involvement in the development of the hydrogen bomb.\n\n# Accolades\n\nOppenheimer won several awards and nominations, including:\n\n* Academy Award for Best Picture\n* Academy Award for Best Director (Christopher Nolan)\n* Academy Award for Best Actor (Cillian Murphy)\n* Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Drama\n* Golden Globe Award for Best Director (Christopher Nolan)\n* Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama (Cillian Murphy)\n\n# See also\n\n* J.

The case involves allegations that Trump, the 45th President of the United States, mishandled classified documents after leaving office in January 2021. The investigation and subsequent indictment have been the subject of significant media attention and public interest.\n\n#Background\n\nIn February 2022, the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) requested that the Department of Justice (DOJ) investigate Trump's handling of presidential records, including classified documents. The request was made after NARA discovered that Trump had taken a large number of documents with him when he left office, including some that were marked as classified.\n\nIn April 2022, the DOJ launched an investigation into Trump's handling of the documents, which was led by the FBI. The investigation involved a search of Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, where many of the documents were found. The search was conducted on August 8, 2022, and resulted in the recovery of over 11,000 documents, including more than 100 that were marked as classified.\n\n#Indictments and Arraignments\n\n##Original Indictment\n\nOn June 8, 2023, a federal grand jury in the Southern District of Florida indicted Trump on charges related to his handling of classified documents. The indictment alleged that Trump had willfully retained national defense information, concealed documents, and obstructed justice. The indictment also named two of Trump's aides, Waltine \"Walt\" Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira, as co-defendants.\n\n##Superseding Indictment\n\nOn July 18, 2023, a superseding indictment was filed, which added new charges against Trump, Nauta, and De Oliveira. The superseding indictment alleged that Trump had tampered with witnesses and attempted to intimidate witnesses.\n\n##Assignment of District Judge\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Aileen Cannon, a federal district judge in the Southern District of Florida. Judge Cannon was appointed to the bench by Trump in 2020.\n\n##Arraignments\n\n###Trump\n\nTrump's arraignment was held on June 13, 2023, at the federal courthouse in Miami, Florida. Trump pleaded not guilty to the charges and was released on his own recognizance.\n\n###Nauta\n\nNauta's arraignment was held on June 15, 2023, at the federal courthouse in Miami, Florida. Nauta pleaded not guilty to the charges and was released on his own recognizance.\n\n###De Oliveira\n\nDe Oliveira's arraignment was held on June 16, 2023, at the federal courthouse in Miami, Florida. De Oliveira pleaded not guilty to the charges and was released on his own recognizance.\n\n#Pretrial Proceedings\n\n##2023\n\nIn the months following the indictment, the parties engaged in pretrial proceedings, including the exchange of discovery materials and the filing of motions. Trump's lawyers filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, which was denied by Judge Cannon.\n\n##2024\n\nIn January 2024, Trump's lawyers filed a motion to indefinitely delay the trial, citing the upcoming presidential election and the need for Trump to focus on his campaign. The motion was opposed by the government, which argued that the trial should proceed as scheduled.\n\n###Trump's Request to Indefinitely Delay Trial\n\nOn January 10, 2024, Judge Cannon denied Trump's motion to indefinitely delay the trial. Judge Cannon ruled that the trial would proceed as scheduled, despite Trump's arguments that he needed to focus on his presidential campaign.\n\n#Dismissal and Appeal\n\nOn March 15, 2024, Judge Cannon dismissed the indictment against Trump, Nauta, and De Oliveira. The dismissal was based on Judge Cannon's ruling that the government had failed to prove that Trump had willfully retained national defense information.\n\nThe government appealed the dismissal to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. The appeal is ongoing.\n\n#Response\n\n##To Indictment\n\n###Trump\n\nTrump responded to the indictment by denying any wrongdoing and accusing the government of engaging in a \"witch hunt.\" Trump also claimed that the indictment was an attempt to prevent him from running for president in 2024.\n\n###Other Republicans\n\nMany other Republicans, including some of Trump's allies, responded to the indictment by defending Trump and attacking the government. Some Republicans argued that the indictment was an attempt to interfere with the 2024 presidential election.\n\n###Democrats\n\nMany Democrats responded to the indictment by welcoming the news and praising the government for taking action against Trump. Some Democrats argued that the indictment was long overdue and that Trump had finally been held accountable for his actions.\n\n##To Dismissal\n\n###Trump\n\nTrump responded to the dismissal of the indictment by celebrating the news and claiming that he had been vindicated. Trump also accused the government of engaging in a \"witch hunt\" and claimed that the dismissal was a victory for his supporters.\n\n###Other Republicans\n\nMany other Republicans responded to the dismissal by praising Judge Cannon and attacking the government. Some Republicans argued that the dismissal was a victory for Trump and a defeat for the \"deep state.\"\n\n###Democrats\n\nMany Democrats responded to the dismissal by criticizing Judge Cannon and attacking Trump. Some Democrats argued that the dismissal was a miscarriage of justice and that Trump had been let off the hook.\n\n#See Also\n\n* Investigation into the 2021 United States Capitol attack\n* January 6 United States Capitol attack\n* Trump–Ukraine scandal\n\n#References\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)\n\n#External Links\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Federal_prosecution_of_Donald_Trump_(classified_documents_case)\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Indictments and arraignments\n##Original indictment\n##Superseding indictment\n##Assignment of district judge\n##Arraignments\n###Trump\n###Nauta\n###De Oliveira\n#Pretrial proceedings\n##2023\n##2024\n###Trump's request to indefinitely delay trial\n#Dismissal and appeal\n#Response\n##To indictment\n###Trump\n###Other Republicans\n###Democrats\n##To dismissal\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This approach to game development has been gaining popularity over the years, with many developers embracing the open-source model as a way to create high-quality games while fostering a sense of community and collaboration.\n\nDefinition and differentiation\n-----------------------------\n\nOpen-source video games are typically defined as games that are released under a license that allows users to access and modify the game's source code. This differentiates them from proprietary games, which are typically developed and published by a single company and are not freely available for modification or distribution.\n\nOpen-source games can be further distinguished from free-to-play games, which are games that are available at no cost but may still be proprietary and subject to certain restrictions. Additionally, open-source games are often distinct from freeware games, which are games that are available at no cost but may not necessarily be open-source.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nThe concept of open-source game development has its roots in the early days of computing, when software was often shared and modified freely. However, with the rise of the commercial game industry, game development became increasingly proprietary, with companies seeking to protect their intellectual property and maintain control over their games.\n\nIn recent years, however, there has been a growing trend towards open-source game development, driven in part by the success of open-source software projects such as Linux and Apache. Many developers have come to see the benefits of open-source development, including the ability to collaborate with others, to share knowledge and expertise, and to create high-quality software that is freely available to all.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### Beginnings and early games\n\nThe history of open-source video games stretches back to the early days of computing, when games were often developed and shared by hobbyists and enthusiasts. One of the earliest examples of an open-source game is the 1970s-era game \"Colossal Cave Adventure,\" which was developed by a group of students at Stanford University and later released under an open-source license.\n\nOther early examples of open-source games include the 1980s-era games \"NetHack\" and \"Larn,\" which were both developed by groups of enthusiasts and released under open-source licenses. These games were often simple text-based adventures, but they laid the groundwork for later open-source game development.\n\n### 3D games and source releases\n\nIn the 1990s, the development of 3D graphics capabilities led to the creation of more complex and sophisticated games. One of the earliest examples of an open-source 3D game is the 1999 game \"Quake,\" which was developed by id Software and later released under an open-source license.\n\nThe release of Quake's source code marked a significant milestone in the history of open-source game development, as it provided developers with access to a high-quality 3D game engine that could be modified and extended. Other companies, such as Epic Games and Valve Corporation, followed id Software's lead and released their own game engines under open-source licenses.\n\n### Rise in popularity and diversity\n\nIn the 2000s, open-source game development began to gain popularity, as more developers became interested in the model and more games were released under open-source licenses. This led to a proliferation of open-source games across a wide range of genres, including first-person shooters, strategy games, and role-playing games.\n\nOne of the most notable examples of an open-source game from this period is the 2004 game \"Battle for Wesnoth,\" a turn-based strategy game that was developed by a team of volunteers and released under an open-source license. Wesnoth has since become one of the most popular open-source games of all time, with a dedicated community of players and developers.\n\n### Greater organization\n\nIn recent years, open-source game development has become more organized, with the establishment of formal projects and communities. One of the most notable examples is the Open Source Game Alliance, which was founded in 2013 to promote open-source game development and provide resources and support to developers.\n\nOther organizations, such as the Linux Game Consortium and the Open Source Game Foundation, have also been established to support open-source game development. These organizations provide a range of services, including hosting, documentation, and community management, to help developers create and distribute open-source games.\n\n### Hubs and development teams\n\nIn addition to formal organizations, open-source game development has also been facilitated by the establishment of online hubs and development teams. One of the most notable examples is the GitHub platform, which provides a range of tools and services for developers to collaborate on open-source projects.\n\nOther platforms, such as GitLab and Bitbucket, also provide similar services, and have become popular hubs for open-source game development. Additionally, online communities such as Reddit's r/gamedev and r/opensourcedev have also become important hubs for developers to share knowledge, resources, and expertise.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Open-source software\n* Free and open-source software\n* Open-source model\n* Open-source license\n* Game development\n* Video game industry\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n*Note: This article does not include any citations or references*\n\nExternal links\n---------------\n\n* Open Source Game Alliance\n* Linux Game Consortium\n* Open Source Game Foundation\n* GitHub\n* GitLab\n* Bitbucket", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Open-source_video_game\" following this outline:\n\n#Definition and differentiation\n#Background\n#History\n##Beginnings and early games\n##3D games and source releases\n##Rise in popularity and diversity\n##Greater organization\n##Hubs and development teams\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
