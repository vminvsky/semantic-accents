During this time, the area was inhabited by the Maya civilization, who built numerous cities, temples, and ceremonial centers. The Maya developed a sophisticated system of writing, architecture, and engineering, which allowed them to create complex cities like Tulum and Chichen Itza. Dzuluinicob was an important center for trade and commerce, with the Maya exchanging goods such as cotton, cacao, and obsidian with other regions.\n\n## Columbian\n\nThe arrival of the Spanish conquistadors in the 16th century had a profound impact on the region. The Spanish brought with them diseases such as smallpox and influenza, which decimated the indigenous population. Many of the Maya were forced to convert to Christianity, and their traditional practices and customs were suppressed. The Spanish also introduced new technologies, such as iron tools and firearms, which revolutionized agriculture and warfare. During the colonial period, Dzuluinicob was part of the Captaincy General of Yucatán, a Spanish administrative division that governed the region.\n\n# Society\n\nThe society of Dzuluinicob is characterized by a mix of indigenous and Spanish influences. The region is home to the Maya people, who have maintained many of their traditional practices and customs. The Maya are known for their expertise in farming, hunting, and handicrafts, and many still speak the Mayan language. The region is also home to a significant number of mestizos, people of mixed indigenous and Spanish ancestry, who have adopted many of the customs and traditions of the Spanish.\n\nThe economy of Dzuluinicob is primarily based on agriculture, with crops such as corn, beans, and squash being major staples. The region is also known for its production of handicrafts, such as textiles, pottery, and woodcarvings. Tourism is also an important sector, with many visitors drawn to the region's rich cultural heritage and natural beauty.\n\n# Legacy\n\n## Scholarly\n\nDzuluinicob has been the subject of numerous scholarly studies, with researchers drawn to the region's rich cultural heritage and natural beauty. The area has been the focus of archaeological excavations, which have uncovered numerous artifacts and ruins from the Pre-Columbian era. The region has also been the subject of ethnographic studies, which have documented the customs and practices of the Maya people.\n\nThe legacy of Dzuluinicob can be seen in its rich cultural heritage, which continues to inspire and influence people around the world. The region's unique blend of indigenous and Spanish influences has created a distinct cultural identity, which is reflected in its architecture, art, and literature. The natural beauty of the region has also made it a popular destination for tourists, who come to experience the area's stunning landscapes and diverse wildlife.\n\n# Notes and references\n\n## Explanatory footnotes\n\n* The name \"Dzuluinicob\" is derived from the Mayan language, with \"dzuluin\" meaning \"descendant\" and \"cob\" meaning \"sun\".\n* The region of Dzuluinicob is also known as the \"Land of the Descendants of the Sun\".\n* The Maya civilization is known for its sophisticated system of writing, architecture, and engineering.\n\n## Short citations\n\n* (No citations included)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Dzuluinicob\" following this outline:\n\n#Geography\n##Physical\n##Political\n#History\n##Pre-Columbian\n##Columbian\n#Society\n#Legacy\n##Scholarly\n#Notes and references\n##Explanatory footnotes\n##Short citations\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The film is based on the true story of the Agojie, an all-female unit of warriors who protected the West African kingdom of Dahomey in the 19th century. The film stars Viola Davis, Thuso Mbedu, Lashana Lynch, Sheila Atim, and John Boyega.\n\n#Plot\n\nThe film takes place in the 1820s and follows the story of Nanisca, the leader of the Agojie, as she trains a new generation of warriors to fight against the Oyo Empire, a rival kingdom that has been threatening Dahomey's borders. The Agojie are known for their bravery and strength, and Nanisca is determined to protect her kingdom and its people from the Oyo Empire's attacks.\n\nAs the story unfolds, Nanisca's past is revealed, showing her journey from being a young girl sold into slavery to becoming the leader of the Agojie. The film also explores the complex relationships between the Agojie and the Dahomey kingdom's ruler, King Ghezo, as well as the tension between the Agojie and the Oyo Empire.\n\n#Cast\n\n* Viola Davis as Nanisca, the leader of the Agojie\n* Thuso Mbedu as Nawi, a young girl who joins the Agojie\n* Lashana Lynch as Izogie, a skilled warrior and Nanisca's second-in-command\n* Sheila Atim as Amenza, a wise and experienced warrior\n* John Boyega as King Ghezo, the ruler of Dahomey\n\n#Production\n\n##Development\n\nThe idea for The Woman King was first conceived by actress Maria Bello, who had read about the Agojie in a book about African history. Bello was fascinated by the story of the all-female unit of warriors and saw potential for a film. She brought the idea to screenwriter Dana Stevens, who began working on the script.\n\nGina Prince-Bythewood was approached to direct the film, and she was immediately drawn to the project. Prince-Bythewood had previously directed films such as Love & Basketball and The Old Guard, and she saw The Woman King as an opportunity to tell a powerful and inspiring story about women.\n\n##Filming\n\nPrincipal photography for The Woman King began in November 2021 and took place in South Africa and Ghana. The film's production team worked closely with historians and cultural consultants to ensure that the film was accurate and respectful in its portrayal of African culture.\n\nThe film's action sequences were choreographed by stunt coordinator Danny Hernandez, who worked closely with the cast to create realistic and intense fight scenes. The film's cinematographer, Polly Morgan, used a combination of sweeping landscape shots and intimate close-ups to capture the beauty and emotion of the story.\n\n##Post-production\n\nPost-production for The Woman King took place in the spring of 2022. The film's editor, Terilyn A. Shropshire, worked closely with Prince-Bythewood to shape the film's narrative and pacing. The film's score was composed by Terence Blanchard, who incorporated traditional African music and instruments into the soundtrack.\n\n#Release\n\nThe Woman King was released in theaters on September 16, 2022. The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival, where it received a standing ovation from the audience.\n\n#Reception\n\n##Box office\n\nThe Woman King performed well at the box office, grossing over $90 million worldwide. The film's success was seen as a major victory for women-led films, and it paved the way for future projects featuring female leads.\n\n##Critical response\n\nThe Woman King received widespread critical acclaim, with many praising the film's powerful performances, stunning action sequences, and inspiring story. The film holds a 94% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with many critics praising Viola Davis's performance as Nanisca.\n\n##Accolades\n\nThe Woman King received several award nominations, including two Academy Award nominations for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress. The film also won several awards, including the National Board of Review Award for Best Ensemble Cast.\n\n#Historical accuracy\n\n##Characters\n\nWhile the characters in The Woman King are fictional, they are based on real people and events. The Agojie were a real unit of female warriors who protected the Dahomey kingdom, and King Ghezo was a real ruler of Dahomey.\n\n##Role in slavery\n\nThe film's portrayal of the transatlantic slave trade has been praised for its accuracy and sensitivity. The film shows the devastating impact of slavery on African communities and the ways in which the slave trade was used to exploit and oppress African people.\n\n#Controversy\n\nSome critics have argued that The Woman King glosses over the role of the Dahomey kingdom in the transatlantic slave trade. While the film does show the kingdom's involvement in the slave trade, some have argued that it does not go far enough in condemning the kingdom's actions.\n\n#Notes\n\nThe Woman King is a powerful and inspiring film that tells the story of a group of women who fought against oppression and exploitation. The film's success has paved the way for future projects featuring women-led casts and has inspired a new generation of filmmakers and actors.\n\n#References\n\n(None)\n\n#Further reading\n\n* \"The Dahomey Warriors: Women Soldiers in West Africa\" by Catherine Higgs\n* \"African Women in the Atlantic Slave Trade\" by Herbert S.

This concept has been explored by numerous composers throughout history, resulting in various sets of music that showcase the entire range of tonal possibilities.\n\n# Notable Sets that Cover All 24 Keys\n\nSeveral composers have written notable sets of music that cover all 24 keys. Some of these sets are discussed below:\n\n## Composers Who Wrote Multiple Sets\n\nSome composers have written multiple sets of music that cover all 24 keys. For example, Johann Sebastian Bach wrote two sets of preludes and fugues, \"The Well-Tempered Clavier,\" Books I and II, which together cover all 24 keys. Similarly, Dmitri Shostakovich wrote two sets of preludes, Opp. 34 and 87, which also cover all 24 keys.\n\n# Variants\n\nIn addition to sets of music that cover all 24 keys, there are also variants that explore different aspects of tonality.\n\n## Single Pieces that Modulate Through Many Keys\n\nSome composers have written single pieces that modulate through many keys, often showcasing the composer's technical skill and creativity. For example, Franz Liszt's \"La Campanella\" is a piano piece that modulates through numerous keys, creating a sense of tonal uncertainty.\n\n## Works Covering All Eight Church Modes\n\nSome composers have written music that covers all eight church modes, which were used in medieval and Renaissance music. For example, the \"Magnificat\" by Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina is a famous example of a work that uses all eight church modes.\n\n## Other Sets of 24 Pieces\n\nIn addition to sets of music that cover all 24 keys, there are also other sets of 24 pieces that explore different aspects of music. For example, the \"24 Caprices\" by Niccolò Paganini are a set of virtuosic pieces for solo violin that explore different technical challenges.\n\n# Keys\n\nThe order of keys in published works can vary, depending on the composer's intentions and the historical context.\n\n## Order of Keys in Published Works\n\nIn some cases, the order of keys in published works is determined by the composer's intention to create a sense of tonal progression or contrast. For example, in Bach's \"The Well-Tempered Clavier,\" the order of keys is determined by the circle of fifths, creating a sense of tonal progression from key to key. In other cases, the order of keys may be determined by the publisher or editor, rather than the composer.\n\n# History\n\nThe concept of music written in all major or minor keys has a long and varied history.\n\n## Bach and His Precursors\n\nJohann Sebastian Bach was one of the first composers to write music that covered all 24 keys. His \"The Well-Tempered Clavier,\" Books I and II, are considered some of the most important works of the Baroque period. However, Bach was not the first composer to explore the concept of music written in all major or minor keys. For example, the composer and theorist Andreas Werckmeister wrote a set of preludes and fugues in all 24 keys, which was published in 1681.\n\n## After Bach\n\nAfter Bach, the concept of music written in all major or minor keys continued to evolve.\n\n### 18th and 19th Centuries\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, numerous composers wrote music that covered all 24 keys. For example, Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven all wrote sets of piano sonatas that covered a range of keys.\n\n#### 1750–1850\n\nDuring this period, the Classical and Romantic periods, composers continued to explore the concept of music written in all major or minor keys. For example, the composer and pianist Muzio Clementi wrote a set of \"Gradus ad Parnassum,\" which covered all 24 keys and was intended as a teaching tool for pianists.\n\n#### 1851–1900\n\nIn the late 19th century, composers such as Liszt and Brahms continued to write music that covered all 24 keys. For example, Liszt's \"La Campanella\" is a famous example of a piece that modulates through numerous keys.\n\n### 20th Century\n\nIn the 20th century, the concept of music written in all major or minor keys continued to evolve.\n\n#### 1901–1950\n\nDuring this period, composers such as Debussy, Ravel, and Bartók wrote music that explored new and experimental approaches to tonality. For example, Debussy's \"Preludes\" are a set of pieces that cover a range of keys and explore new and experimental approaches to tonality.\n\n#### 1951–2000\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century, composers such as Shostakovich, Prokofiev, and Messiaen continued to write music that covered all 24 keys. For example, Shostakovich's \"Preludes and Fugues\" are a set of pieces that cover all 24 keys and explore new and experimental approaches to tonality.\n\n### 21st Century\n\nIn the 21st century, the concept of music written in all major or minor keys continues to evolve.\n\nComposers such as Arvo Pärt, John Adams, and Thomas Adès have written music that explores new and experimental approaches to tonality. For example, Pärt's \"Tabula Rasa\" is a piece that explores new and experimental approaches to tonality and covers a range of keys.\n\n# Notes\n\nMusic written in all major or minor keys is a complex and multifaceted topic that has been explored by numerous composers throughout history. From Bach's \"The Well-Tempered Clavier\" to contemporary works by composers such as Arvo Pärt and Thomas Adès, the concept of music written in all major or minor keys continues to evolve and inspire new and innovative approaches to tonality.\n\n# References\n\n*Please note that this article does not include citations or references.

Ron Hubbard, was an American author, philosopher, and the founder of Scientology. Born on March 13, 1911, in Tilden, Nebraska, Hubbard rose to prominence in the early 20th century as a science fiction writer, before developing the self-help system Dianetics and later the Church of Scientology.\n\n# Life\n\n## Before Dianetics\n\n### Pre-war fiction\n\nHubbard began his writing career at an early age, publishing his first story, \"The Green God,\" in 1934. He went on to write numerous science fiction and fantasy stories, including \"Fear\" and \"Typewriter in the Sky,\" which were published in various pulp magazines. Hubbard's writing style was influenced by the likes of H.G. Wells and Jules Verne, and his stories often featured themes of adventure, technology, and the supernatural.\n\n### Military career\n\nIn 1941, Hubbard joined the United States Navy, where he served as a lieutenant during World War II. He was injured in a ship collision and spent several months in a naval hospital, where he began to develop his ideas about the mind and human behavior. Hubbard was honorably discharged from the Navy in 1945.\n\n### After the war\n\nAfter the war, Hubbard returned to writing, producing a series of science fiction and fantasy novels, including \"Slaves of Sleep\" and \"The End is Not Yet.\" He also began to develop his ideas about the human mind and behavior, which would eventually lead to the creation of Dianetics.\n\n## In the Dianetics era\n\nIn 1950, Hubbard published his self-help book \"Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health,\" which introduced his concept of the \"reactive mind\" and the \"auditing\" process. The book was a surprise success, and Hubbard quickly established the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation to promote and teach his methods.\n\nHowever, the success of Dianetics was short-lived, and the foundation was plagued by financial and organizational problems. Hubbard's ideas were also met with skepticism by the scientific community, and he faced criticism for his lack of formal training in psychology or medicine.\n\n## Pivot to Scientology\n\nIn the early 1950s, Hubbard began to develop his ideas about the nature of the universe and human spirituality, which would eventually lead to the creation of Scientology. He introduced the concept of the \"thetan,\" a spiritual being that inhabits the body, and developed the \"E-meter,\" a device used to measure spiritual energy.\n\nIn 1954, Hubbard established the first Church of Scientology in Los Angeles, and he quickly attracted a loyal following of adherents. Scientology was initially presented as a scientific and philosophical system, rather than a religious one, but it would eventually come to be recognized as a distinct religion.\n\n## In the Church of Scientology era\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, Hubbard expanded the Church of Scientology, establishing missions and churches around the world. He also developed the \"Bridge to Total Freedom,\" a series of spiritual exercises and courses designed to help adherents achieve spiritual enlightenment.\n\nHowever, Hubbard's leadership of the church was also marked by controversy and authoritarianism. He was known for his strict control over the church's finances and operations, and he was accused of exploiting and mistreating his followers.\n\n## In the Sea Org era\n\nIn the late 1960s, Hubbard established the Sea Organization, a paramilitary group within the Church of Scientology that was dedicated to promoting and defending the church's interests. The Sea Org was known for its strict discipline and authoritarianism, and it was accused of engaging in harassment and intimidation tactics against critics and former members.\n\nHubbard himself became increasingly reclusive during this period, living on a yacht and communicating with his followers through a series of written directives and taped lectures.\n\n## In hiding\n\nIn the 1980s, Hubbard went into hiding, reportedly to avoid prosecution for his involvement in a series of financial and tax scandals. He died on January 24, 1986, at the age of 74, and his death was met with widespread speculation and conspiracy theories.\n\n# Sources and doctrines\n\nHubbard's ideas about the mind, human behavior, and spirituality are based on a range of sources, including Eastern philosophy, Western psychology, and science fiction. He was influenced by the likes of Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, and Alfred Korzybski, and he drew on a range of spiritual and philosophical traditions, including Buddhism, Taoism, and Gnosticism.\n\nAt the heart of Hubbard's system is the concept of the \"thetan,\" a spiritual being that inhabits the body and is capable of spiritual growth and development. Hubbard also developed the \"E-meter,\" a device used to measure spiritual energy, and the \"auditing\" process, a technique used to help individuals overcome spiritual and emotional blockages.\n\n# False biographical claims\n\nHubbard made a number of false biographical claims throughout his life, including claims to have been a decorated war hero and a successful businessman. He also exaggerated his educational credentials and his involvement in various scientific and philosophical organizations.\n\nThese claims were often used to promote Hubbard's ideas and to attract followers, but they have been widely debunked by critics and former members.\n\n# Legacy\n\n## In Scientology\n\nHubbard's legacy is still celebrated within the Church of Scientology, where he is revered as a spiritual leader and a visionary. His ideas and writings continue to be studied and promoted by adherents around the world, and his image and likeness are still used to promote the church's interests.\n\n## In popular culture\n\nHubbard's ideas and legacy have also had a significant impact on popular culture, influencing a range of artists, writers, and musicians. His concepts of the \"thetan\" and the \"E-meter\" have been referenced in countless films, books, and TV shows, and his ideas about the nature of the universe and human spirituality continue to be explored and debated.\n\n# Select works\n\n* \"Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health\" (1950)\n* \"Science of Survival\" (1951)\n* \"Self-Analysis\" (1951)\n* \"Advanced Procedure and Axioms\" (1951)\n* \"History of Man\" (1952)\n* \"Scientology: 8-80\" (1952)\n* \"The Creation of Human Ability\" (1954)\n* \"Dianetics 55!\" (1955)\n* \"Introduction to Scientology\" (1969)\n\n# See also\n\n* Church of Scientology\n* Dianetics\n* E-meter\n* Sea Organization\n* Thetan\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is based on a range of sources, including books, articles, and online resources.

The reforms aim to modify the country's system of judicial review, alter the process of judicial selection, and reduce the powers of the Supreme Court. The proposals have been met with widespread controversy and opposition from various sectors of Israeli society, as well as from the international community.\n\n# Background\n\n## Israeli Supreme Court and judicial review\n\nThe Israeli Supreme Court is the highest court in Israel and plays a crucial role in the country's system of judicial review. The court has the power to review and strike down laws and government decisions that are deemed unconstitutional or unreasonable. This power is based on the Israeli Basic Laws, which serve as the country's de facto constitution. The Supreme Court has used its powers of judicial review to shape Israeli law and policy on various issues, including human rights, administrative law, and the separation of powers.\n\n## 1992 Constitutional Revolution and its discontents\n\nThe 1992 Constitutional Revolution was a major turning point in Israeli constitutional law. The Supreme Court, led by Chief Justice Aharon Barak, issued a series of landmark decisions that expanded the court's power of judicial review and established the principle of constitutional supremacy. The court's decisions were seen as a significant shift towards a more liberal and activist approach to constitutional interpretation. However, the Constitutional Revolution also generated controversy and criticism, particularly from right-wing and religious sectors of Israeli society. Some critics argued that the court had overstepped its bounds and was interfering with the democratic process.\n\n## 2018–2022 Israeli political crisis and 2022 legislative election\n\nThe 2018–2022 Israeli political crisis was a period of prolonged political instability, marked by a series of inconclusive elections and failed coalition negotiations. The crisis was fueled by deep divisions within Israeli society, particularly on issues related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, religious freedom, and the role of the judiciary. The 2022 legislative election resulted in a narrow victory for the right-wing Likud party, led by Benjamin Netanyahu, who formed a coalition government with several smaller right-wing and religious parties. The new government vowed to implement significant reforms to the Israeli judicial system, which it saw as a major obstacle to its policy agenda.\n\n# Legislative history\n\n## HCJ 5658/23 Movement for Quality Government in Israel v. Knesset (2024)\n\nThe proposed judicial reforms were introduced in the Knesset in 2023, as part of a broader legislative package aimed at overhauling the Israeli judicial system. The reforms were met with fierce opposition from various sectors of Israeli society, including the Movement for Quality Government in Israel, a non-profit organization that advocates for good governance and the rule of law. The organization petitioned the Supreme Court to strike down the reforms, arguing that they were unconstitutional and would undermine the independence of the judiciary. The court is expected to hear the petition in 2024.\n\n# Proposed changes\n\n## Judicial selection\n\n### Current system\n\nThe current system of judicial selection in Israel is based on a panel of nine members, including three Supreme Court justices, two ministers, two Knesset members, and two representatives of the Israel Bar Association. The panel recommends candidates for appointment to the Supreme Court, and the president of Israel makes the final appointment.\n\n### Proposed system\n\nThe proposed reforms would give the government a majority on the judicial selection panel, allowing it to appoint judges who are more sympathetic to its policy agenda. The reforms would also introduce a new requirement that judges must have a \" Zionist\" worldview, which critics argue is a thinly veiled attempt to exclude judges who are seen as too liberal or left-wing.\n\n### Arguments in favor of the reform\n\nProponents of the reform argue that the current system of judicial selection is flawed and allows the judiciary to appoint judges who are out of touch with the views of the Israeli public. They argue that the reforms would introduce greater diversity and balance to the judiciary, and would ensure that judges are more accountable to the elected government.\n\n### Arguments against the reform\n\nCritics of the reform argue that it would undermine the independence of the judiciary and allow the government to appoint judges who are beholden to its interests. They argue that the reforms would erode the rule of law and damage the reputation of the Israeli judiciary.\n\n## Government legal advisors\n\nThe proposed reforms would also give the government greater control over the appointment of government legal advisors, who play a crucial role in advising the government on legal matters. The reforms would allow the government to appoint advisors who are more sympathetic to its policy agenda, which critics argue would undermine the independence of the legal advice given to the government.\n\n## Constitutional review\n\nThe proposed reforms would limit the power of the Supreme Court to review and strike down laws and government decisions that are deemed unconstitutional. The reforms would introduce a new requirement that the court must have a supermajority of 80% to strike down a law, which critics argue would make it virtually impossible for the court to exercise its power of judicial review.\n\n## Override clause\n\nThe proposed reforms would also introduce an override clause, which would allow the Knesset to override a Supreme Court decision striking down a law. The clause would allow the Knesset to reenact a law that has been struck down by the court, provided that it has a majority of 61 votes.\n\n## Abolition of \"unreasonableness\" grounds\n\nThe proposed reforms would abolish the grounds of \"unreasonableness\" as a basis for judicial review. The reforms would argue that the court should only review laws and government decisions on grounds of constitutional validity, rather than on grounds of reasonableness.\n\n### Arguments in favor of the reform\n\nProponents of the reform argue that the grounds of unreasonableness are too vague and allow the court to interfere with the democratic process. They argue that the reforms would ensure that the court only reviews laws and government decisions on clear constitutional grounds.\n\n### Arguments against the reform\n\nCritics of the reform argue that the abolition of the grounds of unreasonableness would undermine the power of the court to review and strike down laws and government decisions that are arbitrary or capricious. They argue that the reforms would erode the rule of law and damage the reputation of the Israeli judiciary.\n\n## Status of the Attorney-General\n\nThe proposed reforms would also affect the status of the Attorney-General, who is the chief legal advisor to the government. The reforms would allow the government to appoint an Attorney-General who is more sympathetic to its policy agenda, which critics argue would undermine the independence of the legal advice given to the government.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## National\n\nThe proposed reforms have been met with fierce opposition from various sectors of Israeli society, including the judiciary, the legal profession, and civil society organizations. Critics argue that the reforms would undermine the independence of the judiciary and erode the rule of law.\n\n## International\n\nThe proposed reforms have also been criticized by the international community, including the European Union and the United States. Critics argue that the reforms would damage the reputation of the Israeli judiciary and undermine the country's commitment to the rule of law.\n\n## Connection to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict\n\nThe proposed reforms have also been linked to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with critics arguing that they would allow the government to implement policies that are detrimental to the rights of Palestinian citizens of Israel. Proponents of the reforms argue that they would allow the government to implement policies that are necessary to ensure the security and well-being of the Israeli public.\n\n# Suspension and overruling\n\nThe proposed reforms are currently being debated in the Knesset, and it is unclear whether they will be passed into law. Critics of the reforms have vowed to challenge them in the Supreme Court, and it is possible that the court may strike down some or all of the reforms.\n\n# See also\n\n* Israeli Supreme Court\n* Judicial review\n* Constitutional law\n* Israeli-Palestinian conflict\n\n# References\n\n*Note: This article does not include any citations or references, as per the requirements.*\n\n# External links\n\n*Note: This article does not include any external links, as per the requirements.*", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Israeli_judicial_reform\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Israeli Supreme Court and judicial review\n##1992 Constitutional Revolution and its discontents\n##2018–2022 Israeli political crisis and 2022 legislative election\n#Legislative history\n##HCJ 5658/23 Movement for Quality Government in Israel v.

The protests quickly evolved into a broader movement against the Iranian government, with demonstrators demanding an end to the Islamic Republic, greater freedoms for women, and an end to corruption and economic mismanagement.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\n### Condition of women and the Islamic Republic\n\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran has a complex and often contentious relationship with women's rights. Since the 1979 revolution that overthrew the Shah, the government has implemented a series of laws and regulations that restrict the rights and freedoms of women. These laws include mandatory dress codes, restrictions on women's employment and education, and limited access to healthcare and other services. Women who violate these laws can face arrest, fines, and even imprisonment.\n\n### Protest movements under the Islamic Republic\n\nIran has a long history of protest movements, dating back to the 19th century. In the decades since the 1979 revolution, there have been numerous protests and demonstrations, often sparked by economic grievances, government corruption, or human rights abuses. Some notable examples include the 1999 student protests, the 2009 Green Movement, and the 2017-2018 protests against economic inequality.\n\n### Mahsa Amini's arrest and death in custody\n\nMahsa Amini was a 22-year-old Iranian Kurdish woman who was visiting Tehran with her family. On September 13, 2022, she was arrested by the Guidance Patrol, a vice squad that enforces the Islamic Republic's dress code. Amini was accused of wearing a \"loose hijab\" and was taken to a police station for \"re-education.\" She died three days later, on September 16, 2022, while in custody. The official cause of death was listed as a heart attack, but many Iranians suspect that she was beaten or otherwise mistreated by the police.\n\nProtests\n--------\n\n### Slogans and grievances\n\nThe protests that followed Amini's death were marked by a range of slogans and grievances. Many demonstrators called for an end to the Islamic Republic and the establishment of a secular democracy. Others demanded greater freedoms for women, an end to corruption and economic mismanagement, and improved living standards. Some protesters also condemned the government's human rights abuses, including torture, imprisonment, and execution of dissidents.\n\n### Iranian public opinion\n\nThe protests were widely supported by the Iranian public, with many people expressing outrage and anger at Amini's death and the government's response. According to some estimates, as many as 80% of Iranians support the protests, although this figure is difficult to verify.\n\n### Protest techniques\n\nThe protests employed a range of techniques, including demonstrations, marches, sit-ins, and civil disobedience. Many protesters used social media to organize and coordinate their actions, and to disseminate information and images to the outside world.\n\n### Civil boycotts\n\nIn addition to the protests, many Iranians participated in civil boycotts, including boycotts of government-affiliated businesses and institutions. Some people also refused to pay taxes or fines, or to cooperate with government officials.\n\n### Media Western coverage\n\nThe protests received extensive coverage in Western media, with many outlets condemning the government's response and expressing support for the protesters. However, some critics argued that the coverage was biased or sensationalized, and that it failed to provide a nuanced understanding of the complex issues at stake.\n\nCasualties, government response\n-----------------------------\n\n### Casualties\n\nThe protests resulted in a significant number of casualties, including deaths, injuries, and arrests. According to some estimates, as many as 200 people were killed, although this figure is difficult to verify.\n\n### Government casualties\n\nThe government also reported casualties, including deaths and injuries among security forces.\n\n### Arrests and death sentences\n\nMany protesters were arrested and charged with crimes, including \"rioting,\" \"insurrection,\" and \"espionage.\" Some protesters were also sentenced to death, although these sentences have not been carried out.\n\n### Executions\n\nIn December 2022, the Iranian government executed two protesters, Mohammad Mehdi Karami and Seyyed Mohammad Hosseini, who had been convicted of \"corruption on earth\" and \"waging war against God.\" The executions were widely condemned by human rights groups and other critics.\n\n### Suspected food poisoning\n\nIn addition to the violence and repression, many protesters reported suspected food poisoning, which some attributed to government efforts to undermine the protests.\n\n#### University students\n\nUniversity students were among the most affected by the suspected food poisoning, with many reporting symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.\n\n#### Schoolgirls\n\nSchoolgirls were also affected, with some reporting symptoms such as dizziness, headaches, and stomach pain.\n\n### Statements by officials\n\nGovernment officials made a number of statements about the protests, including claims that the protesters were \"rioters\" and \"terrorists\" who were seeking to destabilize the country.\n\n### Government strategy and tactics\n\nThe government employed a range of strategies and tactics to suppress the protests, including violence, repression, and propaganda.\n\n### Communications blackouts\n\nThe government also imposed communications blackouts, including restrictions on internet and mobile phone access.\n\n### Response by regime supporters\n\nRegime supporters, including members of the Basij militia, responded to the protests with violence and intimidation.\n\n### Government campaign for public opinion\n\nThe government launched a campaign to influence public opinion, including efforts to discredit the protesters and promote a positive image of the government.\n\nAftermath\n----------\n\n### Lack of head covering\n\nIn the aftermath of the protests, many Iranian women began to abandon the hijab, which has been mandatory since the 1979 revolution.\n\n### Crackdown\n\nThe government responded to this trend with a crackdown, including arrests and fines for women who failed to wear the hijab.\n\n### Surveillance of protesters and dissidents\n\nThe government also increased surveillance of protesters and dissidents, including monitoring of social media and online activity.\n\nAnalysis\n--------\n\nThe Mahsa Amini protests were a significant event in Iranian history, marking a turning point in the country's struggle for democracy and human rights. The protests highlighted the deep-seated grievances of the Iranian people, including corruption, economic mismanagement, and human rights abuses.\n\nInternational reactions\n----------------------\n\n### International organizations\n\nInternational organizations, including the United Nations and the European Union, condemned the government's response to the protests and called for greater respect for human rights.\n\n### Diplomatic ties\n\nThe protests also affected diplomatic ties between Iran and other countries, including the United States and European nations.\n\n### Human rights advocates\n\nHuman rights advocates, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, condemned the government's response to the protests and called for greater accountability.\n\n### Sanctions\n\nThe United States and other countries imposed sanctions on Iran in response to the government's human rights abuses and other actions.\n\nIn popular culture\n-----------------\n\n### Music\n\nThe protests inspired a range of musical responses, including songs and videos that expressed support for the protesters and condemned the government's actions.\n\n### Sports\n\nThe protests also affected the sports world, including the 2022 FIFA World Cup, which was held in Qatar.\n\n#### 2022 FIFA World Cup\n\nThe Iranian national team was criticized for its response to the protests, including a decision to sing the national anthem before a match against England.\n\n#### Commercialism\n\nThe protests also highlighted issues of commercialism and sponsorship, including the role of companies such as Nike and Adidas in supporting the Iranian national team.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* 1979 Iranian Revolution\n* 1999 student protests\n* 2009 Green Movement\n* 2017-2018 protests\n* Human rights in Iran\n* Women's rights in Iran\n* Iranian government\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nExternal links\n---------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Mahsa_Amini_protests\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Condition of women and the Islamic Republic\n##Protest movements under the Islamic Republic\n##Mahsa Amini's arrest and death in custody\n#Protests\n##Slogans and greviances\n##Iranian public opinion\n##Protest techniques\n##Civil boycotts\n##Media Western coverage\n#Casualties, government response\n##Casualties\n###Government casualties\n##Arrests and death sentences\n###Executions\n##Suspected food poisoning\n###University students\n###Schoolgirls\n##Statements by officials\n##Government strategy and tactics\n##Communications blackouts\n##Response by regime supporters\n##Government campaign for public opinion\n#Aftermath\n##Lack of head covering\n###Crackdown\n###Surveillance of protesters and dissidents\n#Analysis\n#International reactions\n##International organizations\n##Diplomatic ties\n##Human rights advocates\n##Sanctions\n#In popular culture\n##Music\n##Sports\n###2022 FIFA World Cup\n###Commercialism\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The term encompasses a wide range of genres, styles, and themes, and has played a significant role in shaping the film industry and societal attitudes towards women.\n\nFamous Women in Film History\n-----------------------------\n\n### Silent Films\n\nDuring the silent era, women played a crucial role in the development of cinema. Actresses like Mary Pickford, Lillian Gish, and Clara Bow were not only popular stars but also producers and writers.

More recent films like \"Blue Is the Warmest Color\" (2013) and \"Carol\" (2015) have continued this tradition.\n\n### Fear of Entering Cinematography\n\nDespite the progress made by women in film, there are still many obstacles to overcome. Women often face sexism, harassment, and marginalization in the industry. This can lead to a fear of entering cinematography, which can limit the number of women pursuing careers in film.\n\n### Statistics\n\nAccording to a 2020 report by the Sundance Institute, women make up only 24% of directors, 22% of writers, and 17% of editors working in the film industry. These numbers are slowly improving, but there is still much work to be done.\n\n### Documentaries\n\nDocumentary films have played a significant role in women's cinema. Filmmakers like Barbara Kopple, Julia Reichert, and Rachel Grady have created films that explore themes of social justice, politics, and women's rights.\n\n#### Female Filmmakers as Feminists\n\nMany female filmmakers identify as feminists, and their work reflects this. Films like \"The F Word\" (2013) and \"She's Beautiful When She's Angry\" (2014) explore themes of feminism and women's rights. These films often serve as a platform for women's voices and perspectives.\n\n### Celluloid Ceiling\n\nThe term \"celluloid ceiling\" refers to the glass ceiling that women face in the film industry. This ceiling can limit women's access to funding, distribution, and exhibition. It can also limit the types of roles and genres available to women.\n\nNorth America\n-------------\n\n### Canada\n\nCanadian women have made significant contributions to film.

As one of the largest banks in the United States, SVB's collapse had far-reaching effects on its customers, shareholders, and the broader financial system.\n\n# Background\n\nSilicon Valley Bank was a commercial bank founded in 1983, headquartered in Santa Clara, California. The bank specialized in providing financial services to technology and life science companies, as well as venture capital and private equity firms. Over the years, SVB grew rapidly, expanding its operations to become one of the largest banks in the United States, with assets totaling over $200 billion.\n\nSVB's business model focused on providing loans to startups and early-stage companies, often taking on higher risks in exchange for higher returns. The bank's strategy was to build long-term relationships with its clients, providing a range of financial services, including cash management, investment banking, and venture debt.\n\n# Collapse\n\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank was triggered by a combination of factors, including losses on its investment portfolio, instability in the financial markets, and a loss of confidence among its depositors.\n\n## Losses\n\nIn 2022, SVB reported significant losses on its investment portfolio, primarily due to a decline in the value of its securities holdings. The bank had invested heavily in long-term bonds, which had been negatively impacted by rising interest rates. As a result, SVB was forced to write down the value of its securities, resulting in a significant loss.\n\n## Instability\n\nIn early 2023, the financial markets began to experience increased volatility, driven by concerns about inflation, interest rates, and the global economy. This instability led to a decline in the value of SVB's investments, exacerbating the bank's losses.\n\n## Receivership\n\nOn March 10, 2023, the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) announced that it had taken possession of SVB, citing inadequate liquidity and insolvency. The DFPI appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as the receiver, tasked with winding down the bank's operations and selling off its assets.\n\n## Acquisition\n\nOn March 26, 2023, the FDIC announced that it had sold SVB's assets to First Citizens Bank, a North Carolina-based bank. The acquisition included SVB's deposits, loans, and other assets, with First Citizens agreeing to assume SVB's liabilities.\n\n# Effects\n\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank had significant effects on its customers, shareholders, and the broader financial system.\n\n## Customers\n\nSVB's customers, including many technology and life science companies, were impacted by the bank's collapse. Many companies had significant deposits with SVB, which were frozen during the receivership process. While the FDIC guaranteed deposits up to $250,000, many companies had deposits exceeding this amount, leaving them exposed to potential losses.\n\n## Shareholders\n\nSVB's shareholders were severely impacted by the bank's collapse, with the stock price plummeting to near zero. Many shareholders, including venture capital and private equity firms, had invested heavily in SVB, expecting the bank to continue its rapid growth.\n\n## Financial system\n\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank had broader implications for the financial system, highlighting concerns about the stability of the banking sector. The event led to increased scrutiny of bank regulation and supervision, with many calling for increased oversight and stricter capital requirements.\n\n## Legal actions\n\nIn the aftermath of the collapse, several lawsuits were filed against SVB's executives and directors, alleging negligence and breach of fiduciary duty. The lawsuits claimed that the bank's management had failed to adequately manage risk, leading to the collapse.\n\n# Reactions\n\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank sparked a range of reactions, from official responses to debate over government intervention and the causes of the collapse.\n\n## Official responses\n\nRegulatory agencies, including the FDIC and the Federal Reserve, issued statements expressing concern about the collapse and pledging to take action to stabilize the financial system. The agencies emphasized the importance of maintaining confidence in the banking system and ensuring the continuity of essential financial services.\n\n## Debate over government intervention\n\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank sparked debate over the role of government intervention in the financial system. Some argued that the government should have provided more support to the bank, either through a bailout or by providing liquidity. Others argued that the government's hands-off approach was appropriate, allowing the market to correct itself.\n\n## Debate about causes\n\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank also sparked debate about the underlying causes of the event. Some attributed the collapse to poor management and excessive risk-taking, while others pointed to broader systemic issues, including inadequate regulation and supervision.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Collapse_of_Silicon_Valley_Bank\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Collapse\n##Losses\n##Instability\n##Receivership\n##Acquisition\n#Effects\n##Customers\n##Shareholders\n##Financial system\n##Legal actions\n#Reactions\n##Official responses\n##Debate over government intervention\n##Debate about causes\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

L. Zissu\n\nA. L. Zissu was a prominent figure in the Jewish community of Romania during the mid-20th century. As a scholar, journalist, and leader, he played a significant role in promoting Jewish culture, advocating for Jewish rights, and resisting anti-Semitic persecution. This article provides an overview of Zissu's life, highlighting his contributions to the Jewish community and his struggles against Nazi and communist oppression.\n\n# Biography\n\n## Hasidic scholar and journalistic debut\n\nA. L. Zissu was born into a Hasidic family in Romania in the early 20th century. From a young age, he demonstrated a strong affinity for Jewish scholarship and was particularly drawn to the teachings of Hasidism. Zissu's early education was marked by intense study of Jewish texts, including the Talmud and other rabbinic works. His intellectual curiosity and passion for Jewish learning eventually led him to become a respected scholar within the Hasidic community.\n\nIn addition to his scholarly pursuits, Zissu also developed an interest in journalism. He began writing for various Jewish publications, using his platform to promote Jewish culture and address issues affecting the Jewish community. Zissu's writing style was characterized by its clarity, wit, and persuasive power, earning him a reputation as a skilled and influential journalist.\n\n## Religious Zionism\n\nAs a Hasidic scholar and journalist, Zissu was deeply committed to the principles of Religious Zionism. He believed that the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine was a vital step towards the redemption of the Jewish people and the fulfillment of Jewish destiny. Zissu's Zionism was rooted in his interpretation of Jewish scripture and tradition, which he saw as mandating the return of the Jewish people to their ancestral homeland.\n\nZissu's advocacy for Religious Zionism led him to become involved with various Jewish organizations and movements. He worked closely with other Jewish leaders to promote the cause of Jewish statehood and to mobilize support for the Jewish community in Palestine.\n\n## Nazi persecution\n\nThe rise of Nazi Germany in the 1930s posed a grave threat to Jewish communities across Europe, including Romania. Zissu, as a prominent Jewish leader and journalist, was particularly vulnerable to persecution. He was subjected to harassment, intimidation, and eventually, arrest by the Nazi authorities.\n\nDespite the danger, Zissu continued to speak out against Nazi oppression and to advocate for Jewish rights. His writing and public statements were marked by courage and defiance, inspiring many within the Jewish community to resist Nazi persecution.\n\n## Resistance movement\n\nAs the Nazi occupation of Romania intensified, Zissu became increasingly involved in the Jewish resistance movement. He worked closely with other Jewish leaders and activists to organize acts of resistance, including sabotage, espionage, and armed revolt.\n\nZissu's involvement in the resistance movement was motivated by his commitment to Jewish survival and his determination to fight against Nazi oppression. He believed that the Jewish community had a moral obligation to resist its oppressors and to defend its rights and dignity.\n\n## Jewish leadership\n\nIn the aftermath of World War II, Zissu emerged as a prominent leader within the Jewish community of Romania. He played a key role in rebuilding Jewish institutions, promoting Jewish culture, and advocating for Jewish rights.\n\nZissu's leadership was marked by his commitment to Jewish unity and his determination to address the challenges facing the Jewish community. He worked closely with other Jewish leaders to promote cooperation and collaboration, and to develop strategies for addressing the social, economic, and cultural needs of the Jewish community.\n\n## Against communism\n\nThe rise of communism in Romania in the late 1940s posed a new threat to Jewish communities. Zissu, as a prominent Jewish leader, was vocal in his opposition to communism and its impact on Jewish life.\n\nZissu's anti-communism was rooted in his commitment to Jewish autonomy and his determination to protect Jewish rights and freedoms. He believed that communism posed a grave threat to Jewish identity and culture, and that it was essential for the Jewish community to resist communist oppression.\n\n## Securitate set-up and imprisonment\n\nIn the early 1950s, Zissu was arrested by the Romanian secret police, the Securitate, on trumped-up charges of anti-communist activity. He was subjected to torture, interrogation, and eventual imprisonment.\n\nZissu's imprisonment was a result of his vocal opposition to communism and his determination to defend Jewish rights and freedoms. Despite the harsh conditions of his imprisonment, Zissu remained committed to his principles and continued to advocate for Jewish causes.\n\n## Trial, reprieve, and death\n\nZissu's trial was marked by its irregularity and lack of due process. He was denied the right to a fair trial and was subjected to intense pressure to confess to crimes he had not committed.\n\nDespite the irregularities of his trial, Zissu was eventually released from prison and allowed to return to his family. However, his health had been severely compromised by his imprisonment, and he died shortly after his release.\n\n# Legacy\n\nA. L. Zissu's legacy is complex and multifaceted. As a scholar, journalist, and leader, he played a significant role in promoting Jewish culture, advocating for Jewish rights, and resisting anti-Semitic persecution.\n\nZissu's commitment to Jewish identity and culture was unwavering, and his determination to defend Jewish rights and freedoms was inspiring. His leadership and advocacy helped to mobilize the Jewish community and to promote Jewish unity and cooperation.\n\nDespite the challenges and hardships he faced, Zissu remained committed to his principles and continued to advocate for Jewish causes. His legacy serves as a testament to the power of courage, conviction, and determination in the face of adversity.\n\n# Notes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"A._L._Zissu\" following this outline:\n\n#Biography\n##Hasidic scholar and journalistic debut\n##Religious Zionism\n##Nazi persecution\n##Resistance movement\n##Jewish leadership\n##Against communism\n##Securitate set-up and imprisonment\n##Trial, reprieve, and death\n#Legacy\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He joined a team of experienced explorers on a grueling journey across the Arctic ice cap, facing temperatures as low as -40°C and treacherous terrain. Although the team ultimately fell short of their goal, Harding's experience on the expedition solidified his reputation as a fearless and determined adventurer.\n\n#Titan expedition and death\n\nIn 2012, Harding embarked on what would be his final and most ambitious expedition: a journey to the wreck site of the Titanic. He joined a team of experts and explorers on a state-of-the-art submersible vessel, designed to withstand the extreme pressure of the deep ocean.\n\nThe expedition was a groundbreaking attempt to reach the Titanic wreck site, which lies at a depth of over 12,000 feet. Harding and his team faced numerous challenges, including treacherous sea conditions, equipment malfunctions, and the ever-present risk of disaster.\n\nTragically, Harding did not survive the expedition.

He believed that exploration and adventure could be used as a powerful tool for promoting environmental awareness and protecting the world's most vulnerable ecosystems.\n\n#Awards and recognition\n\nHarding received numerous awards and accolades for his expeditions and business ventures. He was recognized as one of the UK's most successful entrepreneurs, and his expeditions were widely covered in the media.\n\nIn 2005, Harding was awarded the prestigious Explorer's Club Medal for his contributions to exploration and adventure.

The storm brought significant snowfall, high winds, and low visibility, resulting in widespread disruptions to daily life, transportation, and the economy. The storm's impact was felt across several states and provinces, including Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, New York, Ontario, and Quebec.\n\n# Meteorological history\n\nThe Great Snowstorm of 1944 was a classic nor'easter, formed when a low-pressure system moved northward along the East Coast of the United States. The storm developed on December 11, 1944, and intensified as it moved northward, fueled by the contrast between cold Arctic air and warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico. The storm's center passed just east of New York City, bringing heavy snowfall and high winds to the region.\n\nThe storm's peak intensity occurred on December 12, with sustained winds of up to 50 mph (80 km/h) and gusts of over 80 mph (130 km/h). The heavy snowfall and high winds resulted in significant drifting and blowing snow, reducing visibility to near zero in many areas. The storm began to subside on December 13, but the effects of the storm lingered for several days.\n\n# Overall impact\n\nThe Great Snowstorm of 1944 had a significant impact on the eastern United States and southeastern Canada. The storm brought widespread disruptions to daily life, with thousands of people stranded in their homes or on roads. The storm also had a significant economic impact, with estimated damages of over $1 billion (approximately $15 billion in today's dollars).\n\nThe storm's impact on transportation was particularly severe. Thousands of cars were stranded on roads, and many highways were closed due to drifting snow and high winds. Air travel was also severely disrupted, with many flights cancelled or delayed.\n\n# Fatalities and injuries\n\nThe Great Snowstorm of 1944 resulted in an estimated 400-500 fatalities, with many more injured. The majority of fatalities were due to hypothermia, asphyxiation, or heart attacks brought on by the extreme cold and physical exertion.\n\nIn addition to the direct fatalities, the storm also had a significant impact on public health. Many people were forced to spend extended periods without heat or light, leading to a significant increase in illnesses such as pneumonia and bronchitis.\n\n# Impacts on most affected areas\n\n## Ohio\n\nOhio was one of the hardest-hit states, with significant snowfall and high winds reported across the state.

The blockade has resulted in a severe humanitarian crisis, with the region's 120,000 inhabitants facing shortages of food, medicine, and other essential supplies.\n\n# Background\n\n## First blockade (1989–2023) and isolation from Armenia (1989–1992)\n\nThe first blockade of Nagorno-Karabakh began in 1989, during the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The blockade was enforced by Azerbaijan, which aimed to isolate the region from Armenia and the rest of the world. The blockade lasted until 1992, when Armenian forces captured the Lachin corridor, reconnecting Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia.\n\n## Threats to public utility infrastructure and entry\n\nIn the years leading up to the current blockade, there were several threats to the public utility infrastructure and entry points of Nagorno-Karabakh. In 2021, Azerbaijan threatened to cut off the gas supply to the region, and in 2022, there were reports of Azerbaijani forces attempting to block the Lachin corridor.\n\n## Prelude\n\nIn the months leading up to the blockade, there were several incidents of Azerbaijani forces harassing and intimidating civilians and vehicles traveling through the Lachin corridor. These incidents were widely reported by international organizations and human rights groups.\n\n# Blockade timeline\n\n## 2022 events\n\nOn December 12, 2022, Azerbaijani forces blockaded the Lachin corridor, citing environmental concerns and allegations of Armenian \"ecological terror.\" The blockade was enforced by Azerbaijani police and special forces, who stopped all traffic and pedestrian movement through the corridor.\n\n## 2023 events\n\nIn January 2023, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) was allowed to transport limited supplies of food and medicine to Nagorno-Karabakh through the Lachin corridor. However, the blockade remained in place, and the region's inhabitants continued to face severe shortages of essential supplies.\n\n# Humanitarian crisis\n\n## Lack of access to supplies and medical care\n\nThe blockade has resulted in a severe humanitarian crisis, with the region's 120,000 inhabitants facing shortages of food, medicine, and other essential supplies. The lack of access to medical care has been particularly devastating, with many residents unable to receive treatment for chronic illnesses or injuries.\n\n### Limited supplies transported by the Red Cross and the Russian peacekeepers\n\nThe ICRC and Russian peacekeepers have transported limited supplies of food and medicine to Nagorno-Karabakh through the Lachin corridor. However, these supplies are insufficient to meet the needs of the region's inhabitants, and many residents continue to face severe shortages.\n\n## Damage to infrastructure\n\nThe blockade has also resulted in significant damage to the region's infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and public buildings. The lack of access to maintenance and repair has accelerated the deterioration of these structures, putting the safety and well-being of the region's inhabitants at risk.\n\n# Genocide risk factors\n\nThe blockade has raised concerns about the risk of genocide in Nagorno-Karabakh. The region's inhabitants are predominantly ethnic Armenians, who have faced persecution and violence at the hands of Azerbaijani forces in the past. The blockade has exacerbated these tensions, and many observers fear that the situation could escalate into a full-scale humanitarian crisis.\n\n# Inaction of the Russian peacekeepers\n\nThe Russian peacekeepers, who have been deployed to the region since 2020, have been criticized for their inaction in the face of the blockade. Despite their mandate to maintain peace and stability in the region, the Russian peacekeepers have failed to intervene to prevent the blockade or ensure the safe passage of civilians and goods.\n\n# Proposed solutions\n\nSeveral solutions have been proposed to resolve the blockade, including the deployment of international observers, the establishment of a humanitarian corridor, and the negotiation of a ceasefire between Armenia and Azerbaijan. However, these proposals have been met with resistance from Azerbaijan, which has refused to lift the blockade.\n\n# Authenticity of the environmental activism claims\n\nThe Azerbaijani government has claimed that the blockade is motivated by environmental concerns, citing allegations of Armenian \"ecological terror.\" However, many observers have questioned the authenticity of these claims, citing evidence of Azerbaijani involvement in the blockade and the lack of transparency in the government's actions.\n\n## Involvement of the Azerbaijani government\n\nThere is evidence to suggest that the Azerbaijani government is involved in the blockade, including reports of government officials and security forces participating in the blockade.\n\n## Involvement of state employees and civil servants\n\nState employees and civil servants have also been involved in the blockade, including reports of teachers and healthcare workers participating in the blockade.\n\n## Inaccessibility of Nagorno-Karabakh to the public and independent journalists\n\nThe blockade has made it difficult for the public and independent journalists to access Nagorno-Karabakh, making it challenging to verify the situation on the ground.\n\n## Scrutiny of the \"protesters\" and their alleged environmental concerns\n\nThe \"protesters\" who have blockaded the Lachin corridor have been subject to scrutiny, with many observers questioning their alleged environmental concerns and motivations.\n\n# Lawsuits\n\nSeveral lawsuits have been filed in relation to the blockade, including a case before the International Court of Justice and a case before the European Court of Human Rights.\n\n## International Court of Justice\n\nA case has been filed before the International Court of Justice, challenging the blockade and seeking relief for the region's inhabitants.\n\n## European Court of Human Rights\n\nA case has also been filed before the European Court of Human Rights, challenging the blockade and seeking relief for the region's inhabitants.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## Involved parties\n\nThe involved parties, including Armenia, Azerbaijan, and the Russian peacekeepers, have reacted to the blockade with varying degrees of concern and condemnation.\n\n## International\n\nThe international community has reacted to the blockade with concern, with many organizations and governments calling for the lifting of the blockade and the restoration of humanitarian access to the region.\n\n## Supranational\n\nSupranational organizations, including the European Union and the United Nations, have also reacted to the blockade, calling for the lifting of the blockade and the restoration of humanitarian access to the region.\n\n## Non-governmental organizations\n\nNon-governmental organizations, including human rights groups and humanitarian organizations, have reacted to the blockade with concern, calling for the lifting of the blockade and the restoration of humanitarian access to the region.\n\n# See also\n\n* Nagorno-Karabakh conflict\n* Lachin corridor\n* Blockade\n* Humanitarian crisis\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a factual and informative piece, and is not intended to take a position on the conflict or the blockade.\n\n# References\n\nWorks cited will be added in the future.\n\n# External links\n\n* [www.osce.org]", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Blockade_of_Nagorno-Karabakh\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##First blockade (1989–2023) and isolation from Armenia (1989–1992)\n##Threats to public utility infrastructure and entry\n##Prelude\n#Blockade timeline\n##2022 events\n##2023 events\n#Humanitarian crisis\n##Lack of access to supplies and medical care\n###Limited supplies transported by the Red Cross and the Russian peacekeepers\n##Damage to infrastructure\n#Genocide risk factors\n#Inaction of the Russian peacekeepers\n#Proposed solutions\n#Authenticity of the environmental activism claims\n##Involvement of the Azerbaijani government\n##Involvement of state employees and civil servants\n##Inaccessibility of Nagorno-Karabakh to the public and independent journalists\n##Scrutiny of the \"protesters\" and their alleged environmental concerns\n#Lawsuits\n##International Court of Justice\n##European Court of Human Rights\n#Reactions\n##Involved parties\n##International\n##Supranational\n##Non-governmental organizations\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n##Works cited\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

They are well adapted to their Arctic habitat, with a thick layer of fat and a white coat that helps them blend in with their snowy surroundings. Polar bears are apex predators and play a crucial role in the Arctic ecosystem.\n\n# Naming\n\nThe scientific name Ursus maritimus is Latin for \"sea bear,\" which refers to the polar bear's marine-based diet and habits. The name \"polar bear\" is thought to have originated from the Greek word \"arktos,\" meaning \"bear,\" and the Latin word \"polaris,\" meaning \"of the pole.\"\n\n# Taxonomy\n\n## Evolution\n\nPolar bears are members of the family Ursidae and are closely related to brown bears (Ursus arctos). The exact timing of the split between polar bears and brown bears is still a topic of debate among scientists, but it is believed to have occurred around 200,000 years ago. Polar bears are thought to have evolved from a population of brown bears that became isolated in the northern regions of Europe and Asia during the Pleistocene era.\n\n# Characteristics\n\nPolar bears are the largest members of the Ursidae family, with adult males weighing up to 800 kg (1,764 lb) and measuring up to 3 m (10 ft) in length. They have a thick layer of fat, known as blubber, which helps to keep them warm in cold temperatures. Their fur is white, which helps them blend in with their snowy surroundings, and they have large paws that act as snowshoes, allowing them to move easily across the snow and ice.\n\nPolar bears are also excellent swimmers, with some individuals able to swim for hours or even days at a time. They have a slow metabolism, which helps them conserve energy, and they are able to slow down their heart rate and reduce their body temperature to conserve energy when food is scarce.\n\n# Distribution and Habitat\n\nPolar bears are found in the Arctic regions of the world, including Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Norway, and Russia. They are found in areas with sea ice, which they use as a platform to hunt and feed on seals, their main source of food.\n\nPolar bears are highly adapted to their Arctic habitat, with a number of physical and behavioral traits that help them survive in the harsh conditions. They are able to withstand extremely cold temperatures, with some individuals able to survive in temperatures as low as -34°C (-29°F).\n\n# Behaviour and Ecology\n\n## Social Life\n\nPolar bears are generally solitary animals, with adults only coming together to mate. Female polar bears will often care for their young for several years, teaching them important survival skills such as hunting and swimming.\n\n## Diet and Hunting\n\nPolar bears are apex predators and feed mainly on seals, which provide them with the necessary fat and nutrients to survive. They are skilled hunters, using a variety of techniques to catch their prey, including stalking, ambushing, and swimming.\n\n## Reproduction and Development\n\nFemale polar bears will typically give birth to two cubs at a time, which are born blind and helpless. The cubs will rely on their mother's milk for several months, before starting to eat solid food at around 6-8 months old.\n\n## Mortality\n\nPolar bears have a number of natural predators, including orcas and other polar bears. They are also vulnerable to human activities such as hunting and climate change, which can impact their access to food and habitat.\n\n# Conservation Status\n\nPolar bears are listed as \"vulnerable\" on the IUCN Red List, due to the impact of climate change on their sea ice habitat. The global population of polar bears is estimated to be around 22,000-31,000 individuals, although the exact number is difficult to determine.\n\n# Relationship with Humans\n\n## Exploitation\n\nPolar bears have been hunted by humans for centuries, with their fur, meat, and organs being used for a variety of purposes. In some cultures, polar bears are considered a delicacy and are hunted for their meat.\n\n## Conflicts\n\nPolar bears can come into conflict with humans when they encroach on human settlements or hunting areas. In some cases, polar bears may be killed by humans in self-defense or to protect property.\n\n## Captivity\n\nPolar bears are often kept in captivity in zoos and wildlife parks, where they are used for education and conservation purposes. However, keeping polar bears in captivity can be challenging due to their specialized dietary and spatial needs.\n\n## Cultural Significance\n\nPolar bears have significant cultural and symbolic meaning in many societies, representing power, strength, and resilience. They are often featured in art, literature, and popular culture, and are considered an important part of many indigenous cultures.\n\n# See also\n\n* Arctic\n* Brown bear\n* Climate change\n* Conservation biology\n* Marine mammal\n* Sea ice\n* Ursidae\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a general overview of the polar bear, and is intended to provide a comprehensive introduction to the species.\n\n# References\n\nThis article does not include references or citations.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Polar_bear\" following this outline:\n\n#Naming\n#Taxonomy\n##Evolution\n#Characteristics\n#Distribution and habitat\n#Behaviour and ecology\n##Social life\n##Diet and hunting\n##Reproduction and development\n##Mortality\n#Conservation status\n#Relationship with humans\n##Exploitation\n##Conflicts\n##Captivity\n##Cultural significance\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born into a prominent aristocratic family, Boethius rose to become one of the most influential figures of the late Western Roman Empire. His works had a profound impact on the development of medieval philosophy, and his legacy continued to shape Western thought for centuries.\n\nEarly Life\n-----------\n\nBoethius was born around 480 AD in Rome, Italy, to a noble family, the Anicii. His father, Manlius Boethius, was a consul and a member of the Roman Senate. After his father's death, Boethius was raised by Quintus Aurelius Memmius Symmachus, a prominent Roman senator and philosopher. Symmachus, who was also a mentor to Boethius, instilled in him a love for learning and a deep appreciation for classical Greek and Roman culture.\n\nBoethius received a comprehensive education in the liberal arts, studying Greek, Latin, philosophy, mathematics, and music. He was particularly drawn to the works of Aristotle and Plato, which would later influence his own philosophical writings. As a young man, Boethius traveled to Athens and Alexandria, where he furthered his studies and engaged with prominent scholars of the time.\n\nRise to Power\n-------------\n\nBoethius' intellectual prowess and family connections quickly propelled him to prominence in Roman society. In 510 AD, he was appointed as a consul, a position that granted him significant influence and authority. As consul, Boethius worked tirelessly to promote the interests of the Roman Empire, often finding himself at odds with the Ostrogothic king, Theodoric the Great.\n\nDespite his differences with Theodoric, Boethius continued to rise through the ranks of Roman politics. In 522 AD, he was appointed as the magister officiorum, a position that made him the chief minister of the Roman Empire. As magister officiorum, Boethius was responsible for overseeing the administration of justice, the military, and the imperial bureaucracy.\n\nDownfall and Death\n-----------------\n\nBoethius' rapid ascent to power ultimately led to his downfall. His close ties to the Roman aristocracy and his opposition to Theodoric's policies made him a target for the king's suspicion and resentment. In 523 AD, Boethius was accused of treason and corruption, charges that were likely fabricated by his enemies.\n\nBoethius was arrested, imprisoned, and eventually put on trial. Despite his protests of innocence, he was found guilty and sentenced to death. In 524 AD, Boethius was executed in Pavia, Italy, at the age of 44.\n\nMajor Works\n------------\n\nBoethius was a prolific writer, and his works span a wide range of subjects, including philosophy, mathematics, music, and theology. Some of his most notable works include:\n\n### De consolatione philosophiae\n\nDe consolatione philosophiae, also known as The Consolation of Philosophy, is Boethius' most famous work. Written while he was in prison, the book is a philosophical dialogue between Boethius and the personification of Lady Philosophy. In the book, Boethius explores the nature of evil, the role of Providence, and the human condition.\n\n### De topicis differentiis\n\nDe topicis differentiis is a treatise on logic and argumentation. In the book, Boethius explores the nature of topical reasoning and provides a comprehensive guide to the use of topics in argumentation.\n\n### De arithmetica\n\nDe arithmetica is a treatise on mathematics, specifically arithmetic. In the book, Boethius provides a detailed explanation of arithmetic operations and explores the properties of numbers.\n\n### De institutione musica\n\nDe institutione musica is a treatise on music theory. In the book, Boethius explores the nature of music and provides a comprehensive guide to the principles of music composition.\n\n### Opuscula sacra\n\nOpuscula sacra is a collection of short theological treatises. In the book, Boethius explores a range of theological topics, including the nature of God, the Trinity, and the Incarnation.\n\nDates of Works\n---------------\n\nThe exact dates of Boethius' works are not known with certainty. However, based on internal evidence and historical context, scholars have been able to establish a rough chronology of his writings.\n\n* De consolatione philosophiae: 523-524 AD\n* De topicis differentiis: 520-523 AD\n* De arithmetica: 500-520 AD\n* De institutione musica: 500-520 AD\n* Opuscula sacra: 520-523 AD\n\nLegacy\n-------\n\nBoethius' works had a profound impact on the development of medieval philosophy. His emphasis on the importance of reason, his use of Aristotelian logic, and his exploration of the nature of evil and the human condition all influenced later thinkers.\n\nBoethius' most famous work, De consolatione philosophiae, was widely read and studied throughout the Middle Ages.

He grew up in a middle-class family and developed an interest in technology and computers from an early age. Teixeira attended a local high school, where he was an average student and showed no signs of exceptional talent or behavior. After completing high school, he enlisted in the US Air National Guard, reportedly to serve his country and gain education benefits.\n\n#Career\n\nTeixeira's military career was relatively short and unremarkable. He served as a intelligence analyst in the US Air National Guard and was stationed at a base in Massachusetts. He held a Top Secret/SCI security clearance, which granted him access to classified information. According to his superiors, Teixeira was a diligent and competent analyst, but he did not stand out in any particular way. He was reportedly well-liked by his colleagues and had no disciplinary issues.\n\n#Alleged publication of leaked material\n\nIn April 2023, a large cache of classified documents appeared on the internet, allegedly leaked by Jack Teixeira. The documents, which included sensitive information about US military operations, intelligence gathering, and national security, were published on a popular online forum. The leak was widely reported in the media, and it sparked a heated debate about government secrecy and national security.\n\nThe leaked documents included information about US military operations in Ukraine, the Middle East, and Africa, as well as details about US intelligence gathering and surveillance programs. The documents also included information about US relations with foreign governments and international organizations. The leak was widely condemned by US government officials, who described it as a serious breach of national security.\n\n##Arrest and prosecution\n\nOn April 13, 2023, Jack Teixeira was arrested by the FBI and charged with unauthorized disclosure of national defense information and unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents. He was taken into custody and held without bail. The US government alleged that Teixeira had leaked the classified documents to the online forum, where they were accessed by thousands of people, including foreign nationals and journalists.\n\nTeixeira's lawyers argued that he was a whistleblower who had acted in good faith to expose government wrongdoing. They claimed that the leaked documents revealed serious abuses of power and corruption within the US government, and that Teixeira's actions were justified. However, the US government disputed this claim, arguing that the leaked documents posed a serious risk to national security and that Teixeira's actions were reckless and irresponsible.\n\nTeixeira's case is ongoing, and it is unclear what the outcome will be. However, the case has sparked a heated debate about government secrecy, national security, and the role of whistleblowers in revealing government wrongdoing.\n\n#See also\n\n* Chelsea Manning\n* Edward Snowden\n* Julian Assange\n* WikiLeaks\n\n#References\n\n*Note: This article does not include any citations or references, as per the requirements.*\n\n#External links\n\n*Note: This article does not include any external links, as per the requirements.*", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Jack_Teixeira\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n#Career\n#Alleged publication of leaked material\n##Arrest and prosecution\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The model's architecture is based on the transformer model, which is a type of neural network specifically designed for NLP tasks. The transformer model allows ChatGPT to process input sequences of varying lengths and to generate output sequences that are coherent and contextually relevant.\n\nFeatures and limitations\n------------------------\n\n### Features\n\nChatGPT has several features that make it useful for a wide range of applications. Some of its key features include:\n\n* **Conversational interface**: ChatGPT can engage in conversation with users, responding to questions and statements in a way that simulates human-like dialogue.\n* **Text generation**: ChatGPT can generate text on a wide range of topics, from simple sentences to longer passages and even entire articles.\n* **Language understanding**: ChatGPT can understand natural language input, including nuances such as idioms, colloquialisms, and figurative language.\n* **Contextual understanding**: ChatGPT can understand the context in which it is being used, allowing it to generate text that is relevant to the conversation or topic at hand.\n\n### Limitations\n\nWhile ChatGPT is a powerful tool, it is not without its limitations. Some of its key limitations include:\n\n* **Lack of common sense**: ChatGPT's understanding of the world is limited to its training data, which means it may not always have the same level of common sense or real-world experience as a human.\n* **Limited domain knowledge**: ChatGPT's knowledge in specific domains may be limited, particularly if its training data does not include a wide range of sources or up-to-date information.\n* **Vulnerability to bias**: ChatGPT may reflect biases present in its training data, which can result in biased or discriminatory output.\n\n### Jailbreaking\n\nChatGPT has been shown to be vulnerable to \"jailbreaking,\" a technique in which users attempt to manipulate the model into producing output that is outside its normal range of responses. Jailbreaking can involve using cleverly crafted input prompts or exploiting weaknesses in the model's architecture. While jailbreaking can be used to test the limits of ChatGPT's capabilities, it can also be used to generate output that is biased, discriminatory, or otherwise undesirable.\n\nService\n--------\n\nChatGPT is available as a cloud-based service, allowing users to interact with the model through a web interface or API. The service includes several features, including:\n\n* **ChatGPT Plus**: A premium version of the service that offers additional features, such as priority access to new models and increased usage limits.\n* **Mobile app**: A mobile app that allows users to access ChatGPT on-the-go.\n* **Software development support**: Support for developers who want to integrate ChatGPT into their own applications.\n\n### March 2023 security breach\n\nIn March 2023, OpenAI announced that ChatGPT had been the victim of a security breach, in which an unauthorized third party had gained access to the model's training data. The breach was attributed to a vulnerability in the model's architecture, which allowed the attacker to access sensitive information.\n\n### Languages\n\nChatGPT is available in multiple languages, including English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean.\n\n### GPT Store\n\nThe GPT Store is a online marketplace that allows developers to buy and sell pre-trained models, including those based on ChatGPT.\n\n### GPT-4\n\nGPT-4 is a successor to ChatGPT, which was released in 2023. GPT-4 includes several new features, including improved language understanding and generation capabilities.\n\n### GPT-4o\n\nGPT-4o is a variant of GPT-4 that is specifically designed for use in online applications.\n\n### o1\n\no1 is a new model that is being developed by OpenAI, which is designed to be more powerful and flexible than ChatGPT.\n\nModel versions\n--------------\n\nChatGPT has several model versions, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Some of the most common model versions include:\n\n* **GPT-3**: The original version of ChatGPT, which was released in 2020.\n* **GPT-3.5**: An updated version of GPT-3, which was released in 2022.\n* **GPT-4**: The latest version of ChatGPT, which was released in 2023.\n\nReception\n----------\n\nChatGPT has received widespread attention and acclaim since its release. Many experts have praised the model's ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text, as well as its potential applications in fields such as customer service, content creation, and education.\n\nApplications\n------------\n\nChatGPT has a wide range of applications, including:\n\n* **Academic research**: ChatGPT can be used to generate text for research papers, articles, and other academic writing.\n* **Coding**: ChatGPT can be used to generate code for programming languages such as Python, Java, and C++.\n* **Computer security**: ChatGPT can be used to generate text for security-related applications, such as penetration testing and vulnerability assessment.\n* **Economics**: ChatGPT can be used to generate text for economic analysis, forecasting, and policy development.\n* **Education**: ChatGPT can be used to generate text for educational materials, such as textbooks, lectures, and online courses.\n* **Culture**: ChatGPT can be used to generate text for cultural applications, such as art, music, and literature.\n* **Financial markets**: ChatGPT can be used to generate text for financial analysis, forecasting, and trading.\n* **Medicine**: ChatGPT can be used to generate text for medical applications, such as diagnosis, treatment, and research.\n* **Law**: ChatGPT can be used to generate text for legal applications, such as contracts, agreements, and court documents.\n\nConcerns\n----------\n\nWhile ChatGPT has many potential benefits, it also raises several concerns, including:\n\n* **Bias and offensiveness**: ChatGPT may reflect biases present in its training data, which can result in biased or discriminatory output.\n* **Copyright issues**: ChatGPT may generate text that infringes on copyrights or other intellectual property rights.\n* **Existential risk**: ChatGPT may pose an existential risk if it is used to generate text that is intentionally misleading or deceptive.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* **Artificial intelligence**\n* **Natural language processing**\n* **Machine learning**\n* **Deep learning**\n* **Transformer model**\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nThis article is a general overview of ChatGPT and its features, limitations, and applications.

The city is an important industrial center, with significant salt mining and processing facilities. Strategically, Soledar is situated near the city of Bakhmut, which has been a major focus of fighting in the region.\n\nPrior to the battle, Soledar had been under Ukrainian control since 2014, when Russian-backed separatists declared the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR). The city remained an important stronghold for Ukrainian forces in the region, providing a defensive bulwark against Russian and separatist advances.\n\n#Battle\n\nThe battle for Soledar can be divided into three distinct phases: the initial Russian advances, the frontline stalemate, and the eventual Russian breakthrough and capture of the city.\n\n##Initial Russian advances (3 August – 1 October 2022)\n\nRussian forces, accompanied by Wagner Group fighters, launched a series of attacks on Ukrainian positions in and around Soledar in early August 2022. The initial push was met with fierce resistance from Ukrainian forces, but Russian troops managed to make incremental gains, gradually encroaching on the city's outskirts.\n\nBy late August, Russian forces had established a foothold on the western edge of Soledar, with Ukrainian troops dug in on the city's eastern periphery. The situation remained fluid, with both sides trading artillery strikes and skirmishing for control of key terrain features.\n\n##Frontline stalls (2 October – 27 December 2022)\n\nAs the initial Russian momentum dissipated, the frontline around Soledar became increasingly static. Both sides dug in, establishing elaborate trench networks and fortified defensive positions.\n\nThroughout the autumn and early winter of 2022, the situation around Soledar remained relatively calm, with only sporadic clashes and artillery exchanges. However, the relative lull belied a significant buildup of Russian forces in the area, as Moscow funneled troops and equipment into the sector.\n\n##Russian breakthrough and capture (27 December 2022 – 16 January 2023)\n\nOn 27 December 2022, Russian forces launched a surprise attack on Ukrainian positions in and around Soledar, using a combination of artillery, airpower, and infantry assaults to break through Ukrainian defenses.\n\nOver the next several weeks, Russian forces gradually pushed Ukrainian troops back, slowly encircling the city. By 7 January 2023, Soledar was effectively cut off from the outside world, with Russian forces in control of the surrounding roads and infrastructure.\n\nOn 16 January 2023, Ukrainian forces retreated from Soledar, ceding control of the city to Russian troops. The fall of Soledar marked a significant strategic victory for Russia, providing a crucial foothold in the Donetsk Oblast and opening up new avenues of advance into Ukrainian-held territory.\n\n#Casualties and humanitarian impact\n\nThe battle for Soledar had a profound impact on both military personnel and civilians in the area.\n\n##Military casualties\n\nEstimates of military casualties vary widely, but it is clear that both sides suffered significant losses during the battle. Ukrainian officials reported that hundreds of Russian troops were killed or wounded in the fighting, while Russian sources claimed to have inflicted heavy casualties on Ukrainian forces.\n\n##Impact on civilians\n\nThe battle for Soledar also had a devastating impact on civilians in and around the city. Many residents were forced to flee their homes due to the intense fighting, with thousands seeking shelter in nearby towns and cities.\n\nThose who remained in the city faced significant challenges, including a lack of access to basic necessities like food, water, and medical care. Reports emerged of civilian casualties, including women and children, who were caught in the crossfire or injured by artillery strikes.\n\n#Analysis\n\nThe battle for Soledar marked a significant turning point in the larger conflict in eastern Ukraine. The Russian capture of the city provided a crucial strategic advantage, opening up new avenues of advance into Ukrainian-held territory and potentially setting the stage for further Russian gains in the region.\n\nHowever, the battle also highlighted the significant challenges facing Russian forces in Ukraine, including fierce Ukrainian resistance and the difficulties of maintaining a large-scale military presence in a hostile environment.\n\nUltimately, the outcome of the battle for Soledar will depend on a range of factors, including the ability of Russian forces to consolidate their gains and the willingness of Ukrainian forces to continue resisting Russian advances.\n\n#See also\n\n* 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* Eastern Ukraine campaign\n* Battle of Bakhmut\n* Wagner Group", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Battle_of_Soledar\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Battle\n##Initial Russian advances (3 August – 1 October 2022)\n##Frontline stalls (2 October – 27 December 2022)\n##Russian breakthrough and capture (27 December 2022 – 16 January 2023)\n#Casualties and humanitarian impact\n##Military casualties\n##Impact on civilians\n#Analysis\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Palladio's designs, which were based on the principles of classical Roman architecture, were characterized by their symmetry, proportion, and use of classical elements such as columns, arches, and domes. The Palladian style was popularized in the 17th and 18th centuries, and it had a profound influence on the development of Western architecture.\n\n# Palladio's Architecture\n\nAndrea Palladio was born in 1508 in Vicenza, Italy, and he trained as a stonemason and sculptor before becoming an architect. His early work was influenced by the classical architecture of ancient Rome, and he became known for his designs for villas and palaces in the Veneto region of Italy. Palladio's most famous work is the Villa Almerico-Capra, also known as La Rotonda, which is considered one of the greatest buildings of all time. La Rotonda is a symmetrical villa with a central dome and four identical facades, each with a pedimented portico.\n\nPalladio's designs were not only aesthetically pleasing but also functional. He was a pioneer of the concept of \"rustication,\" which involved using rough-hewn stone to create a sense of texture and depth on building facades. He also developed the idea of the \" Palladian window,\" which is a large window with a semicircular arch and two smaller windows on either side.\n\n# Venetian and Palladian Windows\n\nThe Venetian window, also known as a \"Palladian window,\" is a characteristic feature of Palladian architecture. It consists of a large central window with a semicircular arch, flanked by two smaller windows with square heads. The windows are typically separated by piers or columns, and the central arch is often decorated with a keystone. The Palladian window was a popular feature of Venetian architecture, and it was often used to illuminate grand halls and reception rooms.\n\nThe Palladian window was not only a decorative feature but also a functional one. It provided a sense of depth and layering to building facades, and it helped to create a sense of grandeur and monumentality. The window also became a symbol of Palladian architecture, and it was often used as a motif in architectural drawings and designs.\n\n# Early Palladianism\n\nPalladianism was popularized in the 17th century by Inigo Jones, an English architect who had traveled to Italy and studied Palladio's designs. Jones was commissioned to design several buildings in England, including the Queen's House at Greenwich and the Banqueting House in Whitehall. These buildings were designed in the Palladian style, with symmetrical facades, classical columns, and Palladian windows.\n\nPalladianism also spread to other parts of Europe, including France and Germany. The style was popularized by architects such as Claude Perrault, who designed the Louvre in Paris, and Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach, who designed the Schönbrunn Palace in Vienna.\n\n# Neo-Palladianism\n\nNeo-Palladianism was a revival of the Palladian style that occurred in the 18th century. The style was popularized by architects such as Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington, who designed the Chiswick House in London, and William Kent, who designed the Holkham Hall in Norfolk.\n\nNeo-Palladianism was characterized by its use of classical elements, such as columns, arches, and domes, and its emphasis on symmetry and proportion. The style was also influenced by the work of Palladio, who had written several books on architecture, including \"I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura\" (The Four Books of Architecture).\n\n## English Palladian Architecture\n\nEnglish Palladian architecture was characterized by its use of classical elements, such as columns, arches, and domes, and its emphasis on symmetry and proportion. The style was popularized by architects such as Inigo Jones, who designed the Queen's House at Greenwich, and Christopher Wren, who designed the Royal Hospital Chelsea.\n\nEnglish Palladian architecture was also influenced by the work of Palladio, who had written several books on architecture. The style was characterized by its use of rustication, which involved using rough-hewn stone to create a sense of texture and depth on building facades.\n\n## Irish Palladian Architecture\n\nIrish Palladian architecture was characterized by its use of classical elements, such as columns, arches, and domes, and its emphasis on symmetry and proportion. The style was popularized by architects such as James Hoban, who designed the White House in Washington, D.C., and Thomas Cooley, who designed the Castletown House in County Kildare.\n\nIrish Palladian architecture was also influenced by the work of Palladio, who had written several books on architecture. The style was characterized by its use of rustication, which involved using rough-hewn stone to create a sense of texture and depth on building facades.\n\n## North American Palladian Architecture\n\nNorth American Palladian architecture was characterized by its use of classical elements, such as columns, arches, and domes, and its emphasis on symmetry and proportion. The style was popularized by architects such as Thomas Jefferson, who designed the Monticello in Virginia, and James Hoban, who designed the White House in Washington, D.C.\n\nNorth American Palladian architecture was also influenced by the work of Palladio, who had written several books on architecture. The style was characterized by its use of rustication, which involved using rough-hewn stone to create a sense of texture and depth on building facades.\n\n## Palladianism Elsewhere\n\nPalladianism also spread to other parts of the world, including Australia, India, and South Africa. The style was popularized by architects such as Francis Greenway, who designed the St. James' Church in Sydney, and John Nash, who designed the Royal Pavilion in Brighton.\n\nPalladianism was also influenced by local architectural styles, such as the use of verandas and colonnades in tropical climates. The style was characterized by its use of classical elements, such as columns, arches, and domes, and its emphasis on symmetry and proportion.\n\n# Legacy\n\nPalladian architecture has had a profound influence on the development of Western architecture. The style's emphasis on symmetry, proportion, and classical elements has influenced architects for centuries, and its legacy can be seen in buildings around the world.\n\nPalladian architecture has also been subject to various interpretations and revisions, from the Neo-Palladianism of the 18th century to the modernist reinterpretations of the 20th century. The style continues to be studied and admired by architects and architectural historians, and its influence can be seen in contemporary architecture.\n\n# See Also\n\n* Andrea Palladio\n* Palladian window\n* Venetian window\n* Neo-Palladianism\n* English Palladian architecture\n* Irish Palladian architecture\n* North American Palladian architecture\n\n# Notes, References, and Sources\n\n## Notes\n\n1.

The club was formed in 1889 and has a rich history in English football. They currently play in the National League South, which is the sixth tier of English football.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\n### Formation and early years (1889–1925)\n\nBath City Football Club was formed in 1889 by a group of local businessmen. The club's early years were spent playing friendly matches against local teams, before joining the Western League in 1891. The club's first major success came in 1894, when they won the Western League title. However, the club's progress was hindered by the lack of a suitable home ground, and they were forced to play at various locations around Bath.\n\n### Large crowds and missing out on Football League (1925–1958)\n\nIn 1925, Bath City moved to their current home, Twerton Park, which had a capacity of over 20,000. The club's attendances soared, with crowds of up to 15,000 attending matches. However, despite their large following, the club failed to gain election to the Football League. The club continued to play in the Southern League, where they enjoyed moderate success, winning the league title in 1930.\n\n### Glory, yoyo years and nationwide football (1958–1996)\n\nIn 1958, Bath City won the Southern League title, and were elected to the Football League for the first time. The club spent several seasons in the Fourth Division, before being relegated back to the Southern League in 1965. The club continued to yo-yo between the Football League and the Southern League, before being relegated to the Conference in 1985. In 1990, the club won the Conference title, but were denied promotion to the Football League due to the league's financial regulations.\n\n### Decline and subsequent relegation (1996–2017)\n\nIn 1996, Bath City were relegated to the Southern League, and the club's decline continued. The club struggled financially, and were forced to sell several key players. In 2007, the club was taken over by a new board of directors, who attempted to stabilize the club's finances. However, the club continued to struggle on the pitch, and were relegated to the Southern League Division One South in 2011.\n\n### The Gill Era (2017–present)\n\nIn 2017, Bath City was taken over by a new owner, Jerry Gill. Gill, a former footballer, had a successful playing career with several clubs, including Bath City. Under Gill's ownership, the club has seen a significant improvement in its finances, and has invested heavily in its youth academy. The club has also seen an improvement in its playing performances, and currently sits in a mid-table position in the National League South.\n\nBadge\n------\n\nThe club's badge features a silhouette of the Royal Crescent, a famous landmark in Bath. The badge also features the club's motto, \"Aqua Sulis\", which is Latin for \"the waters of Sulis\". The badge has undergone several changes over the years, but the current design has been in use since 2017.\n\nStadiums\n---------\n\n### 1889: The North Parade Ground\n\nBath City's first home ground was the North Parade Ground, which was a public park in the center of Bath. The club played at the ground for several seasons, before moving to a new location.\n\n### 1900–1919: Belvoir Castle\n\nIn 1900, the club moved to Belvoir Castle, a large house on the outskirts of Bath. The club played at the ground for several seasons, before moving to a new location.\n\n### 1919–1932: Lambridge\n\nIn 1919, the club moved to Lambridge, a small ground on the outskirts of Bath. The club played at the ground for several seasons, before moving to their current home.\n\n### 1932–present: Twerton Park\n\nIn 1932, Bath City moved to their current home, Twerton Park. The ground has a capacity of over 8,000, and features a large main stand, as well as several smaller stands. The ground has undergone several changes over the years, including the installation of floodlights in 1960.\n\nSupport\n--------\n\nBath City has a dedicated fan base, with supporters from all over the city and surrounding areas. The club's supporters are known for their passion and dedication, and the club's home matches are often well-attended. The club also has a number of supporters' groups, including the Bath City Supporters' Society, which raises money for the club through various fundraising activities.\n\nRecords\n--------\n\n* Record attendance: 18,020 vs. Brighton & Hove Albion, 1960\n* Record victory: 10-0 vs. Trowbridge Town, 1955\n* Record defeat: 0-10 vs. AFC Bournemouth, 1958\n* Most appearances: 515, Jim Rollo (1960-1974)\n* Most goals: 242, Paul Fletcher (1986-1992)\n\nPlayers\n--------\n\n### First-team squad\n\nAs of the 2022-2023 season, the Bath City first-team squad includes:\n\n* Goalkeepers: Ryan Clarke, Luke Southwood\n* Defenders: Dan Ball, Jack Batten, Alex Hartridge, Joe Raynes\n* Midfielders: Tom Smith, Frankie Artus, James Morton, Lloyd James\n* Forwards: Ryan Brunt, Andy Watkins, Adam Mann\n\n### Former players\n\n* Jim Rollo (1960-1974)\n* Paul Fletcher (1986-1992)\n* Andy Williams (1992-1996)\n* Steve Jones (1996-2001)\n* Ryan Harley (2001-2007)\n\n### Player records\n\n* Most appearances: Jim Rollo (515, 1960-1974)\n* Most goals: Paul Fletcher (242, 1986-1992)\n* Most hat-tricks: Andy Williams (5, 1992-1996)\n\nManagement\n-----------\n\n### Coaching\n\nThe club's current coaching staff includes:\n\n* Manager: Jerry Gill\n* Assistant Manager: Jim Rollo\n* First Team Coach: Steve Jones\n* Goalkeeping Coach: Ryan Clarke\n\n### Board of directors\n\nThe club's current board of directors includes:\n\n* Chairman: Jerry Gill\n* Vice Chairman: Nick Blofeld\n* Director of Football: Steve Jones\n* Secretary: Dave Linney\n\n### Managerial history\n\n* 1889-1925: Unknown\n* 1925-1958: Alex Raisbeck\n* 1958-1965: Ted Fenton\n* 1965-1970: Arnold Rodgers\n* 1970-1974: Bobby Evans\n* 1974-1976: Brian Godfrey\n* 1976-1978: Malcolm Musgrove\n* 1978-1981: Micky Burns\n* 1981-1985: Stuart Taylor\n* 1985-1988: Tony Ricketts\n* 1988-1992: George Foster\n* 1992-1996: Steve Millard\n* 1996-2001: Steve Coppell\n* 2001-2007: John Relish\n* 2007-2017: Lee Howells\n* 2017-present: Jerry Gill\n\nHonours\n--------\n\n* Southern League Champions: 1929-30, 1977-78\n* Conference Champions: 1989-90\n* FA Trophy Runners-up: 1985-86\n* Somerset Premier Cup Winners: 1994-95, 1997-98\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n### General\n\n* \"Bath City Football Club: A History\" by David Linney\n* \"The Official Bath City Football Club Website\"\n\n### Specific\n\n* \"Bath City's FA Trophy Run\" by Steve Coppell, The Guardian, 1986\n* \"Bath City's Conference Championship\" by John Relish, The Bath Chronicle, 1990\n\nExternal links\n---------------\n\n### Independent websites\n\n* The Official Bath City Football Club Website\n* Bath City Supporters' Society\n* Bath City FC Forum", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Bath_City_F.C.\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Formation and early years (1889–1925)\n##Large crowds and missing out on Football League (1925–1958)\n##Glory, yoyo years and nationwide football (1958–1996)\n##Decline and subsequent relegation (1996–2017)\n##The Gill Era (2017–present)\n#Badge\n#Stadiums\n##1889: The North Parade Ground\n##1900–1919: Belvoir Castle\n##1919–1932: Lambridge\n##1932–present: Twerton Park\n#Support\n#Records\n#Players\n##First-team squad\n##Former players\n##Player records\n#Management\n##Coaching\n##Board of directors\n##Managerial history\n#Honours\n#References\n##General\n##Specific\n#External links\n##Independent websites\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

In 1941, the royal family, including Constantine, fled to Crete, and later to Egypt, where they remained in exile until 1946.\n\n## After World War II and return to Greece\n\nAfter the war, the royal family returned to Greece, and Constantine began his education. He was enrolled in the Anargyrios and Korgialenios School of Spetses, a prestigious boarding school on the island of Spetses. In 1954, he enrolled in the Hellenic Military Academy, where he trained as an officer in the Greek Army.\n\n# Crown Prince\n\n## Education\n\nAs Crown Prince, Constantine continued his education, studying law at the University of Athens. However, he did not complete his degree, as he was more interested in sports, particularly sailing.\n\n## Sailing and the Olympic Games\n\nConstantine was an accomplished sailor, and he represented Greece in the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, where he won a gold medal in the Dragon class sailing event. This achievement made him the first Greek monarch to win an Olympic medal.\n\n# Reign\n\n## Accession and marriage\n\nConstantine ascended to the throne on March 6, 1964, following the death of his father, King Paul.

This led to a period of political instability, known as the Apostasia of 1965.\n\n## Greek dictatorship of 1967–1974\n\nIn 1967, a military coup led by a group of army officers, known as the Regime of the Colonels, seized power in Greece.

However, the coup failed, and Constantine was forced to flee the country, going into exile in Rome, Italy.\n\n# Restoration of democracy and the referendum\n\nIn 1974, the Regime of the Colonels collapsed, and democracy was restored in Greece. A referendum was held, in which the Greek people voted to abolish the monarchy. Constantine, who had returned to Greece for the referendum, accepted the result and went into exile once again.\n\n# Life in exile after 1974\n\n## Abortive conspiracies\n\nIn the years following his exile, Constantine was involved in several abortive conspiracies to restore the monarchy in Greece. However, these efforts ultimately failed.\n\n## 1993 visit to Greece\n\nIn 1993, Constantine visited Greece for the first time since his exile, where he was met with a mixture of protests and support.\n\n## Legal quarrels over the royal properties\n\nConstantine was also involved in a number of legal disputes with the Greek government over the ownership of the royal properties, including the palace of Tatoi.\n\n# Later life\n\n## Death\n\nConstantine II of Greece died on January 10, 2023, at the age of 82, in Athens, Greece.\n\n# Issue\n\nConstantine had five children with his wife, Princess Anne-Marie of Denmark:\n\n1.
