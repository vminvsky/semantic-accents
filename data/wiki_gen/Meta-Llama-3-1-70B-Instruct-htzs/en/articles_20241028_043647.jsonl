The draft took place from April 28 to 30, 2022, in Las Vegas, Nevada. A total of 262 players were selected over the course of the three-day event.\n\n# Host city\n\nThe 2022 NFL Draft was held in Las Vegas, Nevada, marking the first time the city has hosted the event. The draft was originally scheduled to take place in Las Vegas in 2020, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was instead held virtually. The 2022 draft was held in a unique outdoor setting, with a stage located on the Las Vegas Strip, in front of the Caesars Forum.\n\n# Player selections\n\nThe 2022 NFL Draft consisted of seven rounds, with each of the 32 NFL teams having one selection in each round. The order of the first round was determined by the previous season's standings, with the worst team picking first and the Super Bowl winner picking last. The remaining rounds were also determined by the previous season's standings, but with teams that made the playoffs picking after non-playoff teams.\n\nThe first overall selection was Travon Walker, a defensive end from the University of Georgia, who was selected by the Jacksonville Jaguars. The top five selections were rounded out by Aidan Hutchinson, a defensive end from the University of Michigan, selected by the Detroit Lions; Derek Stingley Jr., a cornerback from Louisiana State University, selected by the Houston Texans; Sauce Gardner, a cornerback from the University of Cincinnati, selected by the New York Jets; and Ikem Ekwonu, an offensive tackle from North Carolina State University, selected by the Carolina Panthers.\n\n# Notable undrafted players\n\nA number of notable players went undrafted in the 2022 NFL Draft, including running back Isaih Pacheco from Rutgers University, who signed with the Kansas City Chiefs, and wide receiver Bailey Zappe from Western Kentucky University, who signed with the New England Patriots. Other notable undrafted players include tight end Grant Calcaterra from Southern Methodist University, who signed with the Philadelphia Eagles, and defensive end Scott Patchan from Colorado State University, who signed with the Los Angeles Chargers.\n\n# Trades\n\nA number of trades took place during the 2022 NFL Draft, with teams moving up or down in the draft order to select specific players. One notable trade saw the New Orleans Saints trade up to the 11th overall selection, where they selected wide receiver Chris Olave from Ohio State University. The Saints traded their first and third-round selections, as well as a 2023 first-round selection, to the Washington Commanders to move up.\n\nAnother notable trade saw the Baltimore Ravens trade their first and fourth-round selections to the Arizona Cardinals to move up to the 14th overall selection, where they selected safety Kyle Hamilton from Notre Dame University.\n\n# 2020 Resolution JC-2A selections\n\nThe 2020 Resolution JC-2A is a rule that allows teams to select players who were granted special eligibility for the 2022 NFL Draft. These players are typically players who were not eligible for the draft in previous years due to injury or other circumstances.\n\nA total of six players were selected under the 2020 Resolution JC-2A in the 2022 NFL Draft, including wide receiver Wan'Dale Robinson from the University of Kentucky, who was selected by the New York Giants in the second round.\n\n# Notes\n\nThe 2022 NFL Draft was notable for a number of reasons, including the fact that it was the first draft to take place in Las Vegas. The draft also saw a number of teams select players from smaller colleges and universities, including the University of Cincinnati and North Carolina State University.\n\nThe draft also saw a number of teams select players who were not considered to be top prospects, but who were still able to make an impact in the NFL. These players include wide receiver Christian Watson from North Dakota State University, who was selected by the Green Bay Packers in the second round, and linebacker Chad Muma from the University of Wyoming, who was selected by the Jacksonville Jaguars in the third round.\n\n# Summary\n\nThe 2022 NFL Draft was a unique and exciting event that saw a number of talented players selected by NFL teams. The draft was notable for a number of reasons, including the fact that it was the first draft to take place in Las Vegas and the number of trades that took place during the event.\n\n## Selections by NCAA conference\n\nThe 2022 NFL Draft saw players from a number of different NCAA conferences selected by NFL teams.

The sixth named storm and fourth hurricane of the 2022 Atlantic hurricane season, Fiona formed from a tropical wave that emerged from the west coast of Africa on September 1.\n\n# Meteorological history\n\nFiona originated from a tropical wave that emerged from the west coast of Africa on September 1. The wave moved westward across the tropical Atlantic, showing signs of organization and development. On September 12, a low-pressure system formed within the wave, and by September 13, the system had developed a closed circulation and was designated as Tropical Depression Seven. The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Fiona on September 14, while located about 600 miles (965 km) east of the Lesser Antilles.\n\nFiona continued to intensify as it moved westward, becoming a hurricane on September 16. The storm's intensity fluctuated over the next few days due to internal dynamics and wind shear. However, on September 18, Fiona underwent rapid intensification, becoming a Category 4 hurricane with winds of 140 mph (225 km/h). The storm's peak intensity was reached on September 20, with maximum sustained winds of 150 mph (240 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 926 mbar (27.34 inHg).\n\n# Preparations\n\nAs Fiona approached the Caribbean, several islands issued tropical cyclone warnings and watches. In Guadeloupe, a hurricane warning was issued on September 15, and residents were advised to stock up on food and water. In Puerto Rico, a hurricane watch was issued on September 16, and the government activated its emergency response plan. The Dominican Republic also issued a hurricane warning on September 17, and the government declared a state of emergency.\n\nIn the Turks and Caicos Islands, a hurricane warning was issued on September 18, and residents were advised to evacuate to higher ground. In Antigua, a hurricane watch was issued on September 19, and the government advised residents to prepare for the storm. In Bermuda, a tropical storm watch was issued on September 20, and residents were advised to prepare for strong winds and heavy rain.\n\n# Impact\n\nFiona caused catastrophic damage and loss of life in several Caribbean islands and eastern Canada.\n\n## Guadeloupe\n\nFiona made landfall in Guadeloupe on September 17, bringing strong winds and heavy rain. The storm caused widespread power outages, with over 80% of the island's residents left without electricity. Several homes were destroyed, and many roads were blocked by fallen trees and debris.\n\n## Puerto Rico\n\nFiona made landfall in Puerto Rico on September 18, causing widespread damage and flooding. The storm's strong winds knocked out power to over 80% of the island's residents, and several homes were destroyed. The storm's heavy rain caused widespread flooding, with several rivers overflowing their banks.\n\n## Dominican Republic\n\nFiona made landfall in the Dominican Republic on September 19, causing widespread damage and flooding. The storm's strong winds knocked out power to over 70% of the country's residents, and several homes were destroyed. The storm's heavy rain caused widespread flooding, with several rivers overflowing their banks.\n\n## Turks and Caicos\n\nFiona made landfall in the Turks and Caicos Islands on September 20, causing widespread damage and flooding. The storm's strong winds knocked out power to over 90% of the islands' residents, and several homes were destroyed. The storm's heavy rain caused widespread flooding, with several roads and buildings damaged.\n\n## Antigua\n\nFiona passed close to Antigua on September 20, causing strong winds and heavy rain. The storm's strong winds knocked out power to over 50% of the island's residents, and several homes were damaged. The storm's heavy rain caused widespread flooding, with several roads and buildings damaged.\n\n## Bermuda\n\nFiona passed close to Bermuda on September 24, causing strong winds and heavy rain. The storm's strong winds knocked out power to over 30% of the island's residents, and several homes were damaged. The storm's heavy rain caused widespread flooding, with several roads and buildings damaged.\n\n## Eastern Canada\n\nFiona made landfall in eastern Canada on September 24, causing widespread damage and flooding. The storm's strong winds knocked out power to over 500,000 residents, and several homes were destroyed. The storm's heavy rain caused widespread flooding, with several rivers overflowing their banks.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe aftermath of Fiona was marked by widespread destruction and loss of life.\n\n## Puerto Rico\n\nIn Puerto Rico, the storm's aftermath was marked by widespread power outages and flooding. The government activated its emergency response plan, and several relief centers were established.

Midnights received widespread critical acclaim and commercial success, breaking multiple records and solidifying Swift's position as a leading figure in contemporary music.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nMidnights was first announced by Swift on August 28, 2022, during the MTV Video Music Awards. The album's title, tracklist, and release date were revealed on Swift's social media accounts, generating significant buzz among fans and media outlets.

The artwork has been praised for its simplicity and elegance.\n\nRelease and promotion\n---------------------\n\nMidnights was released on October 21, 2022, through Republic Records. The album was available on all major streaming platforms, as well as on CD and vinyl.

The cyclone caused widespread damage, flooding, and landslides, resulting in significant disruptions to daily life and the economy.\n\nMeteorological History\n-------------------\n\nCyclone Gabrielle formed on February 5, 2023, as a tropical low-pressure system over the Coral Sea, northeast of Australia. The system gradually intensified as it moved southwest, becoming a tropical cyclone on February 7. Over the next few days, Gabrielle continued to strengthen, reaching category 3 status on the Australian cyclone intensity scale on February 10. The cyclone then began to move southeast, towards the eastern coast of New Zealand.\n\nEffects\n--------\n\n### Melanesia\n\nGabrielle brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to several countries in Melanesia, including Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands, and Fiji. The cyclone caused significant damage to infrastructure, homes, and crops, with many communities left without electricity or access to basic services. In Vanuatu, the cyclone damaged over 100 homes and disrupted the country's main airport. In the Solomon Islands, Gabrielle caused widespread flooding and landslides, with several communities cut off from the rest of the country.\n\n### Norfolk Island\n\nGabrielle passed close to Norfolk Island on February 11, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall. The cyclone caused significant damage to the island's infrastructure, including the airport and several homes. The island's residents were forced to take shelter as the cyclone passed overhead, with several people injured in the storm.\n\n### New Zealand\n\nGabrielle made landfall in New Zealand on February 12, bringing heavy rainfall and strong winds to the eastern coast of the North Island. The cyclone caused widespread damage and disruption, particularly in the regions of Northland, Auckland, Waikato, Gisborne, and Hawke's Bay.\n\n#### Northland\n\nIn Northland, Gabrielle caused significant damage to infrastructure, including roads and bridges. The cyclone also brought heavy rainfall, resulting in widespread flooding and landslides. Several communities were left without electricity or access to basic services, with many residents forced to evacuate their homes.\n\n#### Auckland\n\nIn Auckland, Gabrielle caused significant disruption, particularly in the city's central business district. The cyclone brought strong winds, resulting in several buildings being damaged and trees being uprooted. The city's main airport was also closed due to the storm, with several flights cancelled or delayed.\n\n#### Waikato\n\nIn Waikato, Gabrielle caused significant damage to infrastructure, including roads and bridges. The cyclone also brought heavy rainfall, resulting in widespread flooding and landslides. Several communities were left without electricity or access to basic services, with many residents forced to evacuate their homes.\n\n#### Gisborne\n\nIn Gisborne, Gabrielle caused significant damage to infrastructure, including roads and bridges. The cyclone also brought heavy rainfall, resulting in widespread flooding and landslides. Several communities were left without electricity or access to basic services, with many residents forced to evacuate their homes.\n\n#### Hawke's Bay\n\nIn Hawke's Bay, Gabrielle caused significant damage to infrastructure, including roads and bridges. The cyclone also brought heavy rainfall, resulting in widespread flooding and landslides. Several communities were left without electricity or access to basic services, with many residents forced to evacuate their homes.\n\n#### Manawatū-Whanganui\n\nIn Manawatū-Whanganui, Gabrielle caused significant damage to infrastructure, including roads and bridges. The cyclone also brought heavy rainfall, resulting in widespread flooding and landslides. Several communities were left without electricity or access to basic services, with many residents forced to evacuate their homes.\n\n#### Other regions\n\nIn other regions of New Zealand, Gabrielle caused significant disruption, particularly in the regions of Bay of Plenty, Taupo, and Rotorua. The cyclone brought heavy rainfall and strong winds, resulting in widespread damage and disruption.\n\nResponses\n---------\n\n### New Zealand\n\nIn response to the cyclone, the New Zealand government declared a state of emergency, with several regions affected by the storm. The government also established a relief fund to support affected communities, with several million dollars pledged to support relief efforts.\n\n#### Relief\n\nSeveral relief organizations, including the Red Cross and the Salvation Army, responded to the cyclone, providing support to affected communities. The organizations provided food, shelter, and other essential services to those affected by the storm.\n\n#### Government\n\nThe New Zealand government responded to the cyclone, with several government agencies involved in relief efforts. The government also established a taskforce to coordinate relief efforts, with several government ministers involved in the response.\n\n#### Civil society\n\nCivil society organizations, including community groups and non-governmental organizations, responded to the cyclone, providing support to affected communities. The organizations provided food, shelter, and other essential services to those affected by the storm.\n\n#### Inquiries\n\nFollowing the cyclone, several inquiries were established to investigate the response to the storm. The inquiries aimed to identify lessons learned and areas for improvement in responding to future natural disasters.\n\n#### Managed retreat\n\nIn the wake of the cyclone, there were calls for a managed retreat from areas affected by the storm.

The case is being handled by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) and is one of several investigations into Trump's actions following the 2020 election.\n\n# Background\n\n## Accusations of electoral fraud and attempts to overturn the election\n\nFollowing the 2020 presidential election, Trump repeatedly made false claims of widespread electoral fraud and attempted to overturn the results of the election. He and his allies filed numerous lawsuits in several states, but most were dismissed due to lack of evidence. Trump also pressured state officials, including the Secretary of State of Georgia, to change the outcome of the election.\n\n## January 6 Capitol attack and investigations\n\nOn January 6, 2021, a mob of Trump supporters stormed the United States Capitol, attempting to prevent the certification of President-elect Joe Biden's victory. The incident resulted in five deaths and numerous injuries. The DOJ launched an investigation into the attack, and several individuals have been charged with crimes related to the incident.\n\n# Original indictment and arraignment\n\nOn June 8, 2023, a federal grand jury returned an indictment against Trump, charging him with four counts related to his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. The indictment alleged that Trump conspired to defraud the United States, obstruct an official proceeding, and deprive individuals of their rights under the Constitution and laws of the United States.\n\nTrump was arraigned on June 13, 2023, and pleaded not guilty to all charges. The arraignment was held in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, and Trump was released on his own recognizance.\n\n# Superseding indictment and arraignment\n\nOn August 1, 2023, a superseding indictment was returned against Trump, adding additional allegations and charges. The superseding indictment included new charges related to Trump's alleged conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding and his efforts to pressure state officials to change the outcome of the election.\n\nTrump was arraigned on the superseding indictment on August 8, 2023, and again pleaded not guilty to all charges.\n\n# Statements in the indictment\n\n## Allegations and statements\n\nThe indictment alleged that Trump and his co-conspirators engaged in a multi-faceted effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election, including:\n\n* Making false claims of widespread electoral fraud\n* Pressuring state officials to change the outcome of the election\n* Filing lawsuits to challenge the election results\n* Inciting violence and intimidation against individuals involved in the election process\n\n## Count One: Conspiracy to defraud the United States\n\nThe indictment alleged that Trump and his co-conspirators conspired to defraud the United States by attempting to overturn the 2020 presidential election. The conspiracy allegedly involved making false claims of widespread electoral fraud and pressuring state officials to change the outcome of the election.\n\n## Further allegations and statements\n\nThe indictment further alleged that Trump and his co-conspirators:\n\n* Knew that their claims of widespread electoral fraud were false\n* Made repeated attempts to pressure state officials to change the outcome of the election\n* Incited violence and intimidation against individuals involved in the election process\n\n## Count Two: Conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding\n\nThe indictment alleged that Trump and his co-conspirators conspired to obstruct an official proceeding by attempting to prevent the certification of President-elect Joe Biden's victory. The conspiracy allegedly involved making false claims of widespread electoral fraud and pressuring state officials to change the outcome of the election.\n\n## Count Three: Obstruction of an official proceeding\n\nThe indictment alleged that Trump and his co-conspirators obstructed an official proceeding by attempting to prevent the certification of President-elect Joe Biden's victory. The obstruction allegedly involved making false claims of widespread electoral fraud and pressuring state officials to change the outcome of the election.\n\n## Count Four: Conspiracy against rights\n\nThe indictment alleged that Trump and his co-conspirators conspired to deprive individuals of their rights under the Constitution and laws of the United States. The conspiracy allegedly involved making false claims of widespread electoral fraud and pressuring state officials to change the outcome of the election.\n\n# Co-conspirators\n\nThe indictment named several individuals as co-conspirators, including:\n\n* Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal attorney\n* John Eastman, a former Trump advisor\n* Jeffrey Clark, a former Justice Department official\n\n# Pretrial proceedings\n\n## Initial timetable\n\nThe court established an initial timetable for the pretrial proceedings, including:\n\n* June 15, 2023: Deadline for Trump to file pretrial motions\n* July 1, 2023: Deadline for the government to respond to Trump's pretrial motions\n* August 1, 2023: Deadline for Trump to file a response to the government's motions\n\n## Protective orders and security measures\n\nThe court issued protective orders and security measures to protect sensitive information and ensure the safety of individuals involved in the case.\n\n## Other pre-trial motions\n\nThe parties filed several other pretrial motions, including:\n\n* Motions to compel discovery\n* Motions to suppress evidence\n* Motions to dismiss certain charges\n\n## Immunity dispute\n\nThe parties engaged in a dispute over the issue of immunity for certain witnesses. The government argued that the witnesses were entitled to immunity, while Trump's defense team argued that the witnesses were not entitled to immunity.\n\n### Appeals\n\nThe immunity dispute was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n\n### Proceedings resulting from the immunity decision\n\nThe appeals court ruled in favor of the government, holding that the witnesses were entitled to immunity. The decision was appealed to the United States Supreme Court.\n\n## Post-immunity timetable\n\nFollowing the immunity decision, the court established a new timetable for the pretrial proceedings, including:\n\n* September 1, 2023: Deadline for Trump to file additional pretrial motions\n* October 1, 2023: Deadline for the government to respond to Trump's additional pretrial motions\n* November 1, 2023: Deadline for Trump to file a response to the government's additional motions\n\n# Potential witnesses and evidence\n\n## Prosecution\n\nThe prosecution has identified several potential witnesses and evidence, including:\n\n* Former Trump officials and advisors\n* State officials who were pressured by Trump to change the outcome of the election\n* Documents and records related to Trump's efforts to overturn the election\n\n## Defense\n\nThe defense has identified several potential witnesses and evidence, including:\n\n* Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani\n* Trump's former advisor, John Eastman\n* Documents and records related to the election and Trump's efforts to challenge the results\n\n# Reactions\n\n## Defendant\n\nTrump has denied any wrongdoing and has characterized the indictment as a \"witch hunt.\"\n\n## Republicans in support of the indictment\n\nSeveral Republicans have expressed support for the indictment, including:\n\n* Senator Mitt Romney\n* Representative Liz Cheney\n\n## Republicans opposed to the indictment\n\nSeveral Republicans have expressed opposition to the indictment, including:\n\n* Senator Ted Cruz\n* Representative Jim Jordan\n\n## Democrats in support of the indictment\n\nSeveral Democrats have expressed support for the indictment, including:\n\n* President Joe Biden\n* Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi\n\n# See also\n\n* 2020 United States presidential election\n* January 6 United States Capitol attack\n* Federal prosecution of Donald Trump (classified documents case)\n\n# References\n\n# External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Federal_prosecution_of_Donald_Trump_(election_obstruction_case)\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Accusations of electoral fraud and attempts to overturn the election\n##January 6 Capitol attack and investigations\n#Original indictment and arraignment\n#Superseding indictment and arraignment\n#Statements in the indictment\n##Allegations and statements\n##Count One: Conspiracy to defraud the United States\n##Further allegations and statements\n##Count Two: Conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding\n##Count Three: Obstruction of an official proceeding\n##Count Four: Conspiracy against rights\n#Co-conspirators\n#Pretrial proceedings\n##Initial timetable\n##Protective orders and security measures\n##Other pre-trial motions\n##Immunity dispute\n###Appeals\n###Proceedings resulting from the immunity decision\n##Post-immunity timetable\n#Potential witnesses and evidence\n##Prosecution\n##Defense\n#Reactions\n##Defendant\n##Republicans in support of the indictment\n##Republicans opposed to the indictment\n##Democrats in support of the indictment\n#See also\n#References\n##Footnotes\n##Citations\n##Works cited\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Bagley is a retired CIA officer and author, best known for his work in counterintelligence and his writings on the Cold War-era espionage activities of the Soviet Union's KGB. Bagley's career spanned over four decades, during which he played a significant role in several high-profile cases involving Soviet spies and defectors.\n\n#Early life and education\n\nTennent H. Bagley was born on August 19, 1925, in Alameda, California. He grew up in a family of modest means and was the youngest of three children. Bagley's early life was marked by a strong interest in languages and international affairs, which would later serve him well in his career as a CIA officer. He attended the University of California, Berkeley, where he studied Russian and European history.\n\n#Career\n\nBagley joined the CIA in 1952, shortly after graduating from college. He began his career as a junior officer in the agency's Soviet Division, where he worked on analyzing Soviet military capabilities and identifying potential security threats. Over the years, Bagley rose through the ranks, becoming a specialist in counterintelligence and eventually serving as the chief of the CIA's Soviet Bloc Division.\n\nDuring his career, Bagley was involved in numerous high-profile cases involving Soviet spies and defectors. He worked closely with other intelligence agencies, including the FBI and British MI5, to identify and counter Soviet espionage activities. Bagley's expertise in counterintelligence and his knowledge of Soviet operations made him a valuable asset to the CIA.\n\n##Bagley's Analysis of the KGB-CIA War\n\nIn his book \"Spy Wars,\" Bagley provides a detailed analysis of the KGB-CIA war, which he describes as a \"war of wits\" between the two intelligence agencies. According to Bagley, the KGB-CIA war was characterized by a series of espionage operations, double agents, and counterintelligence measures that played out over several decades.\n\nBagley argues that the KGB-CIA war was a critical aspect of the Cold War, as it involved the use of espionage and other clandestine activities to gather intelligence and influence policy. He notes that the KGB was highly effective in using its agents to penetrate the CIA and other Western intelligence agencies, while the CIA struggled to counter these efforts.\n\n##The Popov Case\n\nOne of the most significant cases Bagley worked on was the Pyotr Popov case. Popov was a Soviet military officer who defected to the CIA in 1952. He provided the agency with valuable information about Soviet military capabilities and operations, including details about the Soviet Union's nuclear program.\n\nBagley was involved in the debriefing of Popov and played a key role in assessing the credibility of the information he provided. He notes that Popov's defection was a major coup for the CIA, as it provided the agency with unprecedented insight into Soviet military operations.\n\n##The Golienewski Case\n\nAnother significant case Bagley worked on was the Michal Goleniewski case. Goleniewski was a Polish intelligence officer who defected to the CIA in 1960. He provided the agency with information about Polish intelligence operations and identified several Soviet spies who were operating in the West.\n\nBagley was involved in the debriefing of Goleniewski and helped to assess the credibility of the information he provided. He notes that Goleniewski's defection was significant, as it provided the CIA with valuable insight into Soviet intelligence operations in Eastern Europe.\n\n##The Nosenko Case\n\nOne of the most infamous cases Bagley worked on was the Yuri Nosenko case. Nosenko was a KGB officer who defected to the CIA in 1962. He provided the agency with information about KGB operations and identified several Soviet spies who were operating in the West.\n\nBagley was involved in the debriefing of Nosenko and played a key role in assessing the credibility of the information he provided. However, Nosenko's defection was also marked by controversy, as some CIA officers questioned his credibility and motives.\n\n##Nosenko and the \"Zepp\" Incident\n\nOne of the most significant incidents involving Nosenko was the \"Zepp\" case. In 1962, Nosenko provided the CIA with information about a KGB operation codenamed \"Zepp,\" which involved the use of a double agent to penetrate the CIA.\n\nBagley was involved in the investigation of the Zepp case and helped to identify the double agent, who was later revealed to be a CIA officer named Lee Harvey Oswald. The Zepp case was significant, as it highlighted the KGB's ability to use double agents to penetrate the CIA.\n\n##More Nosenko\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding Nosenko's defection, Bagley remained convinced that he was a genuine defector who provided valuable information to the CIA. He notes that Nosenko's information helped the agency to identify several Soviet spies who were operating in the West and to disrupt KGB operations.\n\n##The KITTY HAWK / Shadrin Case\n\nAnother significant case Bagley worked on was the Nicholas Shadrin case. Shadrin was a Soviet naval officer who defected to the CIA in 1959. He provided the agency with information about Soviet naval operations and identified several Soviet spies who were operating in the West.\n\nBagley was involved in the debriefing of Shadrin and helped to assess the credibility of the information he provided. He notes that Shadrin's defection was significant, as it provided the CIA with valuable insight into Soviet naval operations.\n\n##Rebuttal to John L. Hart's HSCA testimony\n\nIn 1978, John L. Hart, a former CIA officer, testified before the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) and accused Bagley of being involved in a CIA plot to assassinate Lee Harvey Oswald. Bagley strongly denied these allegations and provided evidence to rebut Hart's claims.\n\n##Reactions to his Spy Wars book\n\nBagley's book \"Spy Wars\" was widely praised by reviewers for its detailed analysis of the KGB-CIA war. However, some reviewers criticized Bagley for his handling of certain cases, including the Nosenko case.\n\n##In popular culture\n\nBagley's career and writings have been the subject of several books, films, and television shows. He was portrayed by actor Brian Cox in the 2007 film \"The Bourne Ultimatum.\"\n\n##Personal life\n\nBagley is married and has two children. He currently lives in retirement in the United States.\n\n##References", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Tennent_H._Bagley\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and education\n#Career\n#Bagley's Analysis of the KGB-CIA War\n#The Popov Case\n#The Golienewski Case\n#The Nosenko Case\n#Nosenko and the \"Zepp\" Incident\n#More Nosenko\n#The KITTY HAWK / Shadrin Case\n#Rebuttal to John L.

It was founded in 1447 as a chantry and later became a Latin school. Over the centuries, the institution underwent several transformations, becoming a renowned agricultural college and eventually part of Imperial College London. This article provides an overview of the college's history, estate and facilities, legacy activities, and notable alumni and staff.\n\n# History\n\n## Chantry\n\nWye College was founded in 1447 by John Kempe, Archbishop of York, as a chantry, a type of medieval foundation dedicated to the celebration of masses for the souls of the dead. The chantry was established to provide for the spiritual welfare of the local community and to support the education of young men. During its early years, the chantry was closely associated with the nearby parish church of St. Gregory and St. Martin.\n\n## After abolition\n\nFollowing the dissolution of the chantries in 1547, the institution was re-established as a Latin school, providing education to local boys. The school continued to operate until the 19th century, when it was transformed into an agricultural college.\n\n## Lady Joanna Thornhill School\n\nIn 1847, the Lady Joanna Thornhill School was founded, named after Lady Joanna Thornhill, the wife of Sir John Thornhill, a local landowner. The school provided education to local girls and was known for its strong emphasis on domestic skills.\n\n## South Eastern Agricultural College\n\nIn 1894, the South Eastern Agricultural College was established, offering courses in agriculture, horticulture, and related subjects. The college quickly gained a reputation for its innovative approach to agricultural education and research.\n\n## Wye College\n\nIn 1948, the college was renamed Wye College, reflecting its close association with the village of Wye. During the post-war period, the college underwent significant expansion, introducing new courses and research programs.\n\n## Imperial College at Wye\n\nIn 1994, Wye College merged with Imperial College London, becoming Imperial College at Wye. The new institution continued to offer courses in agriculture, horticulture, and related subjects, while also introducing new programs in areas such as environmental science and conservation.\n\n### Imperial College scheme\n\nThe merger with Imperial College was part of a larger scheme to create a network of specialist colleges within the university. The aim was to provide students with access to a wider range of courses and research opportunities, while also promoting collaboration between different academic disciplines.\n\n### Closure\n\nIn 2009, Imperial College announced the closure of its Wye campus, citing financial constraints and a decline in student numbers. The decision was met with opposition from local residents, alumni, and staff, who argued that the college was an important part of the community and a valuable resource for the region.\n\n# Estate and facilities\n\n## Layout\n\nThe Wye College estate was situated in the heart of the village, surrounded by rolling hills and farmland. The college buildings were arranged around a central courtyard, with the old chantry and Latin school forming the core of the complex.\n\n## Student accommodation\n\nThe college provided a range of accommodation options for students, including halls of residence, flats, and houses. Many of the buildings were converted from old farmhouses and cottages, providing a unique and characterful living environment.\n\n## Old Flying Horse\n\nThe Old Flying Horse was a 17th-century coaching inn that served as the college's main social hub. The building featured a large function room, bar, and restaurant, and was popular with students, staff, and local residents.\n\n## Cloister\n\nThe cloister was a tranquil courtyard surrounded by the old chantry buildings. The space was used for relaxation, study, and social events, and featured a beautiful garden and fountain.\n\n## Painted glass\n\nThe college chapel featured stunning stained-glass windows, depicting scenes from the Bible and the history of the college. The windows were created by local craftsmen and were considered some of the finest examples of stained glass in the country.\n\n## Latin School\n\nThe old Latin school building dated back to the 16th century and featured a beautifully restored interior. The building was used for teaching and administrative purposes, and was also open to the public for tours and events.\n\n## Old Hall\n\nThe Old Hall was a grand dining room that served as the college's main refectory. The room featured a large wooden table, ornate plasterwork, and a stunning stone fireplace.\n\n## Parlour\n\nThe parlour was a comfortable lounge area that provided a quiet space for relaxation and study. The room featured a large fireplace, comfortable seating, and a selection of books and games.\n\n## Withersdane Hall\n\nWithersdane Hall was a modern conference center that provided facilities for events, meetings, and training programs. The building featured a large auditorium, breakout rooms, and state-of-the-art audiovisual equipment.\n\n## Jacobean staircase\n\nThe Jacobean staircase was a beautifully crafted staircase that dated back to the 17th century. The staircase featured intricate carvings, ornate banisters, and a stunning stained-glass window.\n\n## Students' Union\n\nThe Students' Union was a modern building that provided a range of facilities for students, including a bar, restaurant, shop, and social spaces.

The monument consists of four large granite stones, each inscribed with a set of guidelines or principles in eight different languages. The purpose and meaning of the Guidestones have been the subject of much debate and speculation, with some viewing them as a call for a new world order and others seeing them as a harmless philosophical statement.\n\n# History\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones were erected in 1980, and their history is shrouded in mystery.\n\n## Construction\n\nThe Guidestones were constructed by a man who identified himself as R.C. Christian, who hired a local stoneworker, Joe Fendley, to build the monument. Christian was reportedly a representative of a group of individuals who wanted to remain anonymous, and he provided Fendley with a detailed set of specifications for the monument. The construction of the Guidestones took several months, and they were finally erected on a hilltop in Elbert County in March 1980.\n\n## Reaction\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones were initially met with a mixture of curiosity and skepticism by local residents. Some people saw them as a harmless novelty, while others were concerned about the monument's cryptic message and the identity of its creators. As news of the Guidestones spread, they attracted attention from around the world, with many people visiting the site to see the monument for themselves.\n\n## Destruction\n\nOn July 6, 2022, a large explosion damaged the Georgia Guidestones, causing significant destruction to the monument. The explosion was reportedly caused by a bomb, and it is still unclear who was responsible for the attack.\n\n### Aftermath\n\nFollowing the destruction of the Guidestones, the site was closed to the public, and an investigation was launched to determine the cause of the explosion and identify those responsible. The incident sparked widespread outrage and condemnation, with many people expressing sadness and dismay at the loss of the monument.\n\n# Description\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones are a unique and intriguing monument, consisting of four large granite stones, each standing over 19 feet tall.\n\n## Inscriptions\n\nEach of the four stones is inscribed with a set of guidelines or principles, which are often referred to as the \"Ten Commandments of the Guidestones.\" The inscriptions are written in eight different languages: English, Spanish, Swahili, Hindi, Hebrew, Arabic, Chinese, and Russian. The guidelines are as follows:\n\n1. Maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature.\n2. Guide reproduction wisely – improving fitness and diversity.\n3. Unite humanity with a living new language.\n4. Rule passion – faith – tradition – and all things with tempered reason.\n5. Protect people and nations with fair laws and just courts.\n6. Let all nations rule internally resolving external disputes in a world court.\n7. Avoid petty laws and useless officials.\n8. Balance personal rights with social duties.\n9. Prize truth – beauty – love – seeking harmony with the infinite.\n10. Be not a cancer on the earth – Leave room for nature.\n\n## Explanatory tablet\n\nIn addition to the inscriptions on the four stones, there is a smaller explanatory tablet located at the site, which provides some context and background information about the Guidestones. The tablet explains that the monument was erected in the hope of promoting peace, harmony, and unity among humanity, and that the guidelines are intended to serve as a moral and philosophical framework for achieving these goals.\n\n## Physical data\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones are constructed from four large granite stones, each weighing over 20 tons. The stones are arranged in a square pattern, with each stone aligned with the four cardinal directions (north, south, east, and west). The monument is 19 feet 3 inches tall, and the stones are each 6 feet 6 inches wide.\n\n## Guidestone languages\n\nThe inscriptions on the Guidestones are written in eight different languages, which were reportedly chosen for their widespread use and relevance to the global community. The languages are:\n\n* English\n* Spanish\n* Swahili\n* Hindi\n* Hebrew\n* Arabic\n* Chinese\n* Russian\n\n## Astronomical features\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones are aligned with several astronomical features, including the rising and setting of the sun and the North Star. The monument is also aligned with the constellation Orion, which is visible in the night sky during the winter months.\n\n# Interpretations\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones have been the subject of much speculation and interpretation, with many people offering their own theories about the monument's meaning and purpose.\n\n## Conspiracy theories\n\nSome people believe that the Guidestones are part of a larger conspiracy to control world population and impose a new world order. Others see the monument as a call for a one-world government and a reduction in individual freedoms. These conspiracy theories have been widely debunked, but they continue to circulate online and in popular culture.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of mysterious monuments\n* New World Order\n* Conspiracy theories\n\n# References\n\n* (Note: This section is intentionally blank, as per the requirements)\n\n# Further reading\n\n* \"The Georgia Guidestones\" by R.C.

The shooting resulted in the deaths of 10 people and the injury of three others. The perpetrator, identified as Payton S. Gendron, was taken into custody at the scene.\n\n# Shooting\n\nThe shooting occurred at approximately 2:30 pm local time, when Gendron, wearing tactical gear and armed with a rifle, entered the supermarket. He began firing shots, targeting employees and customers. Witnesses reported hearing multiple gunshots and described the scene as chaotic. The shooting lasted for several minutes, with Gendron allegedly yelling racial slurs and targeting African American individuals.\n\n# Victims\n\nTen people were killed in the shooting, ranging in age from 32 to 86. The victims included:\n\n* Aaron Salter, a retired police officer who attempted to stop the shooter\n* Celestine Chaney, a mother of three\n* Heyward Patterson, a deacon at a local church\n* Katherine Massey, a community activist\n* Margus Morrison, a father of two\n* Pearl Young, a mother of two\n* Roberta Drury, a 32-year-old woman who was shopping with her sister\n* Ruth Whitfield, an 86-year-old woman who was shopping for groceries\n* Andre Mackneil, a 53-year-old man who was shopping for his mother\n* Geraldine Talley, a 62-year-old woman who was shopping for her family\n\nThree others were injured in the shooting, including a store employee who was shot in the leg.\n\n# Immediate Aftermath\n\nFollowing the shooting, the supermarket was evacuated, and the surrounding area was cordoned off by police. Emergency services responded to the scene, and the injured were transported to local hospitals. The police department's SWAT team was deployed, and Gendron was taken into custody without incident.\n\n# Investigation\n\nThe investigation into the shooting was led by the FBI, with assistance from local law enforcement agencies. Authorities reviewed CCTV footage, witness statements, and online activity to piece together the events leading up to the shooting.\n\n## Investigation of previous threat\n\nIn June 2021, Gendron had made a threat against his high school, which led to a police investigation. He was subsequently hospitalized for a mental health evaluation and was released after a few days. Authorities did not file charges, citing a lack of evidence.\n\n## Weapons\n\nGendron used a Bushmaster XM-15 rifle, which he had purchased legally in New York State.

{"title": "Anantarika-karma", "content": "#See also\n#References\n#Further reading\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Anantarika-karma\n================\n\nAnantarika-karma is a Buddhist concept that refers to a specific type of karma that is considered to be so severe that it inevitably leads to rebirth in one of the lower realms, such as hell or the animal kingdom. The concept of anantarika-karma is rooted in the Buddhist understanding of the nature of karma and the consequences of certain actions.\n\nEtymology\n----------\n\nThe term \"anantarika-karma\" is derived from the Sanskrit words \"anantarika,\" meaning \"without interval\" or \"immediately,\" and \"karma,\" meaning \"action\" or \"deed.\" This term is often translated as \"immediate karma\" or \"karma without interval.\"\n\nDefinition\n----------\n\nAnantarika-karma refers to a specific type of karma that is considered to be so severe that it inevitably leads to rebirth in one of the lower realms. This type of karma is considered to be \"immediate\" because it is believed to produce its effects in the very next life, without any interval or delay. Anantarika-karma is often contrasted with other types of karma, such as \"karma with interval\" (santatika-karma), which may produce its effects in a future life, but not necessarily in the very next one.\n\nTypes of Anantarika-karma\n-------------------------\n\nThere are several types of anantarika-karma that are recognized in Buddhist tradition. These include:\n\n### Killing one's mother\n\nKilling one's mother is considered to be a grave offense in Buddhist tradition, and is believed to lead to rebirth in hell. This act is considered to be especially heinous because the mother is seen as the embodiment of compassion and kindness.\n\n### Killing one's father\n\nKilling one's father is also considered to be a grave offense in Buddhist tradition, and is believed to lead to rebirth in hell. This act is considered to be especially heinous because the father is seen as the embodiment of authority and wisdom.\n\n### Killing an arhat\n\nAn arhat is a Buddhist saint who has achieved enlightenment. Killing an arhat is considered to be a grave offense in Buddhist tradition, and is believed to lead to rebirth in hell. This act is considered to be especially heinous because the arhat is seen as a embodiment of wisdom and compassion.\n\n### Causing a schism in the sangha\n\nThe sangha is the community of Buddhist monks and nuns. Causing a schism in the sangha is considered to be a grave offense in Buddhist tradition, and is believed to lead to rebirth in hell. This act is considered to be especially heinous because it undermines the unity and harmony of the sangha.\n\nConsequences of Anantarika-karma\n---------------------------------\n\nThe consequences of anantarika-karma are believed to be severe and far-reaching. Individuals who commit anantarika-karma are believed to be reborn in one of the lower realms, where they will suffer greatly. The specific consequences of anantarika-karma vary depending on the type of karma committed, but are generally believed to include:\n\n* Rebirth in hell\n* Rebirth in the animal kingdom\n* Rebirth in a state of great suffering and misery\n* Loss of all good fortune and happiness\n\nAvoiding Anantarika-karma\n-------------------------\n\nBuddhists believe that it is possible to avoid anantarika-karma by following the principles of the Buddhist path. This includes:\n\n* Cultivating compassion and kindness towards all living beings\n* Avoiding harm and violence towards others\n* Practicing mindfulness and wisdom\n* Following the Buddhist precepts and ethical guidelines\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nAnantarika-karma is a Buddhist concept that refers to a specific type of karma that is considered to be so severe that it inevitably leads to rebirth in one of the lower realms. The consequences of anantarika-karma are believed to be severe and far-reaching, and Buddhists believe that it is possible to avoid anantarika-karma by following the principles of the Buddhist path.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Karma\n* Buddhist ethics\n* Rebirth\n* Hell\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n* None\n\nFurther reading\n---------------\n\n* \"The Buddhist Concept of Anantarika-karma\" by K.

It is the solid part of the planet, as opposed to the hydrosphere (water) and atmosphere (air). Land plays a crucial role in supporting life, shaping climate, and influencing human activities. This article provides an overview of land, covering its definition, etymology, physical and life sciences, features, layers, human interactions, and environmental concerns.\n\n# Definition\n\nLand is generally defined as the solid surface of the Earth, extending from the atmosphere to the lithosphere, the outermost solid layer of the planet. It includes all terrains, landforms, and features, such as mountains, valleys, plains, and water bodies. Land is often contrasted with sea, which refers to the saltwater bodies that cover approximately 71% of the Earth's surface.\n\n# Etymology\n\nThe word \"land\" has its roots in Old English and Germanic languages. The Old English term \"land\" referred to a territory or a country, while the Germanic word \"*landa-\" meant \"earth\" or \"ground.\" Over time, the term \"land\" has evolved to encompass a broader range of meanings, including soil, terrain, and real estate.\n\n# Physical science\n\n## Formation\n\nThe Earth's land surface was formed through a combination of geological processes, including plate tectonics, volcanism, and erosion. The movement of tectonic plates has shaped the planet's surface over millions of years, resulting in the creation of mountains, oceans, and continents. Volcanic activity has added new land through the eruption of magma and lava, while erosion has worn down existing landforms, creating valleys and canyons.\n\n## Landmasses\n\nThe Earth's land surface is divided into several large landmasses, including continents, islands, and microcontinents. The seven continents are Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America. Islands and microcontinents, such as Madagascar and Greenland, are smaller landmasses that are often separated from the main continents by oceans or seas.\n\n## Terrain\n\nTerrain refers to the physical features of the land surface, including its shape, elevation, and relief. Terrain can be broadly classified into several types, including mountains, hills, valleys, and plains. Mountains are elevated landforms that are typically formed through tectonic activity, while hills are smaller, rounded landforms. Valleys are low-lying areas between hills or mountains, while plains are flat or gently sloping regions.\n\n## Geomorphology\n\nGeomorphology is the study of the Earth's physical features and landforms. It examines the processes that shape the land surface, including erosion, deposition, and weathering. Geomorphologists study the relationships between landforms, climate, and human activities, providing insights into the evolution of the Earth's surface over time.\n\n## Climate\n\nClimate plays a significant role in shaping the Earth's land surface. Temperature, precipitation, and wind patterns influence the formation of landforms, the distribution of vegetation, and the movement of water. Climate also affects human activities, such as agriculture, transportation, and settlement patterns.\n\n# Features\n\n## Coasts and islands\n\nCoasts are the boundaries between land and sea, while islands are landmasses that are surrounded by water. Coasts can be rocky, sandy, or muddy, depending on the underlying geology and oceanographic conditions. Islands can be coral reefs, volcanic islands, or continental fragments.\n\n## Mountains and plateaus\n\nMountains are elevated landforms that are typically formed through tectonic activity. They can be volcanic, fold, or block mountains, depending on their geological origin. Plateaus are elevated regions of relatively flat terrain, often formed through erosion or volcanic activity.\n\n## Plains and valleys\n\nPlains are flat or gently sloping regions, often formed through erosion or deposition. Valleys are low-lying areas between hills or mountains, often formed through river erosion or tectonic activity.\n\n## Caves and craters\n\nCaves are underground openings or voids, often formed through karst processes or volcanic activity. Craters are depressions formed through volcanic activity or meteorite impacts.\n\n# Layers\n\n## Land cover\n\nLand cover refers to the physical features that cover the Earth's surface, including vegetation, soil, water, and human-made structures. Land cover can be natural or human-induced, and it plays a crucial role in shaping the environment and supporting life.\n\n## Soil\n\nSoil is the upper layer of the Earth's crust, composed of mineral and organic particles, water, and air. Soil is a critical component of ecosystems, supporting plant growth, filtering water, and storing carbon.\n\n## Continental crust\n\nThe continental crust is the outermost solid layer of the Earth, underlying the oceans and continents. It is composed of rocks and minerals, and it plays a crucial role in shaping the planet's surface over time.\n\n# Life science\n\n## Land biomes\n\nLand biomes are large ecosystems that are characterized by specific vegetation, climate, and geography. Examples of land biomes include forests, grasslands, deserts, and tundra. Each biome supports a unique array of plant and animal species.\n\n## Fauna and flora\n\nFauna refers to the animal species that inhabit a particular region, while flora refers to the plant species. The diversity of fauna and flora varies greatly across different ecosystems and biomes, reflecting the complex relationships between organisms and their environments.\n\n# Humans and land\n\n## Culture\n\nHuman culture is deeply connected to the land, reflecting the ways in which people interact with their environment. Culture is shaped by the natural features of the land, including climate, terrain, and natural resources.\n\n## Travel\n\nTravel refers to the movement of people from one place to another, often for recreational or economic purposes. Travel can have significant impacts on the environment, including the degradation of natural habitats and the introduction of invasive species.\n\n## Trade\n\nTrade refers to the exchange of goods and services between different regions or countries. Trade can have significant impacts on the environment, including the exploitation of natural resources and the degradation of ecosystems.\n\n## Land use\n\nLand use refers to the ways in which people use the land, including agriculture, urbanization, and conservation. Land use can have significant impacts on the environment, including the degradation of natural habitats and the loss of biodiversity.\n\n## Law\n\nLand law refers to the regulations and policies that govern the use of land, including property rights, zoning, and environmental regulations. Land law plays a crucial role in shaping the relationships between people and the land.\n\n## Geopolitics\n\nGeopolitics refers to the study of the relationships between politics, geography, and international relations. Geopolitics plays a significant role in shaping the use of land, including the distribution of natural resources and the movement of people.\n\n# Environmental issues\n\n## Soil degradation\n\nSoil degradation refers to the decline in soil quality, often caused by erosion, pollution, or overuse. Soil degradation can have significant impacts on ecosystems, including the loss of fertility and the decline of plant growth.\n\n## Pollution\n\nPollution refers to the introduction of harmful substances into the environment, including air, water, and soil pollution. Pollution can have significant impacts on ecosystems, including the decline of plant and animal species.\n\n## Biodiversity loss\n\nBiodiversity loss refers to the decline in the variety of plant and animal species, often caused by habitat destruction, climate change, or overexploitation.

From its humble beginnings as a revolutionary communication device to its current status as a ubiquitous tool for global connectivity, the telephone has undergone significant transformations. This article will explore the major milestones in the history of the telephone in the United States, including the development of AT&T and the Bell System, the emergence of cellphones and smartphones, and the impact of the telephone on society and culture.\n\n# AT&T and the Bell System\n\nThe history of the telephone in the United States is closely tied to the development of AT&T and the Bell System. The Bell System was a network of telephone companies that dominated the industry for much of the 20th century, and AT&T was its parent company.\n\n## American Bell Telephone Company (1881–1899)\n\nThe American Bell Telephone Company was founded in 1881 by Alexander Graham Bell, the inventor of the telephone. The company's early years were marked by rapid expansion and innovation, as it established a network of telephone exchanges and developed new technologies to improve the quality and reach of telephone service. In 1885, American Bell established the first long-distance telephone line, connecting Boston and New York.\n\n## AT&T (1899–1982)\n\nIn 1899, American Bell changed its name to AT&T, and the company began to expand its operations nationally. Under the leadership of Theodore Vail, AT&T developed a comprehensive network of telephone lines and exchanges, and introduced new technologies such as the switchboard and the dial telephone. AT&T also became a major player in the development of radio and television broadcasting, and established a research and development arm, Bell Labs, which would go on to make significant contributions to the development of modern telecommunications.\n\n## Research priority\n\nThroughout its history, AT&T has placed a strong emphasis on research and development. Bell Labs, established in 1925, was a major center for innovation and experimentation, and its researchers made significant contributions to the development of modern telecommunications, including the invention of the transistor and the development of the first commercial touch-tone telephone.\n\n## Targeting an audience\n\nAT&T's marketing efforts were also focused on targeting specific audiences. The company developed a range of marketing campaigns aimed at different demographic groups, including urban and rural communities, and businesses and households.\n\n### Urban public telephones\n\nOne of AT&T's most successful marketing initiatives was the development of urban public telephones. The company established a network of public telephone booths in cities across the country, providing convenient and accessible telephone service to urban residents.\n\n### Rural telephone service\n\nAT&T also made significant efforts to expand telephone service to rural areas. The company developed a range of technologies and marketing initiatives aimed at rural communities, including the introduction of the \"party line,\" which allowed multiple households to share a single telephone line.\n\n## Breakup of AT&T in 1982\n\nIn 1982, the U.S. Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit against AT&T, alleging that the company had engaged in monopolistic practices. The lawsuit led to the breakup of AT&T into seven regional Bell operating companies, which were spun off from the parent company. The breakup marked a significant turning point in the history of the telephone in the United States, as it led to increased competition and innovation in the industry.\n\n# Cellphones and smartphones\n\nThe development of cellphones and smartphones has had a profound impact on the history of the telephone in the United States. The first cellphones were introduced in the 1980s, and they quickly gained popularity as a convenient and portable alternative to traditional landline phones.\n\nIn the 1990s, the development of digital cellphones led to a significant increase in the quality and functionality of mobile phone service. The introduction of the first smartphone, the IBM Simon, in 1994 marked a major milestone in the development of mobile telecommunications.\n\nSince then, the development of smartphones has continued to accelerate, with the introduction of new technologies such as 3G and 4G networks, and the development of mobile applications and services.\n\n# Personnel\n\nThe history of the telephone in the United States is also closely tied to the development of the industry's workforce. The telephone industry has been shaped by the contributions of thousands of workers, including switchboard operators, linemen, and customer service representatives.\n\n## Switchboard and operators\n\nThe switchboard was a critical component of the early telephone system, and switchboard operators played a key role in connecting calls. The work of switchboard operators was highly skilled and demanding, requiring quick thinking and attention to detail.\n\n## Labor force: bias for and against women\n\nThe telephone industry has a complex history of labor force bias, both for and against women. In the early years of the industry, women were often excluded from certain jobs, such as lineman work, due to physical demands and cultural attitudes. However, women were also actively recruited for switchboard and operator work, which was seen as more suitable for women.\n\n### Strikes\n\nThroughout the 20th century, telephone workers, including switchboard operators and linemen, engaged in numerous strikes and labor actions to improve working conditions and wages. One notable example is the 1919 Bell Telephone strike, which involved over 100,000 workers and lasted for several weeks.\n\n## Hawthorne studies\n\nThe Hawthorne studies, conducted in the 1920s and 1930s, were a series of experiments aimed at improving worker productivity and morale. The studies, which were conducted at the Hawthorne Works factory in Illinois, found that worker productivity was influenced by a range of factors, including working conditions, supervision, and social relationships.\n\n## Employee benefits\n\nThe telephone industry has a long history of providing employee benefits, including health insurance, pensions, and paid time off. In the mid-20th century, AT&T introduced a range of employee benefits, including a comprehensive health insurance plan and a pension program.\n\n# Users\n\nThe telephone has had a profound impact on society and culture in the United States, shaping the way people communicate, work, and live. The telephone has been used for a wide range of purposes, including business, socializing, and emergency services.\n\n## Business\n\nThe telephone has been a critical tool for businesses, enabling them to communicate with customers, suppliers, and employees. The development of the telephone has also led to the creation of new industries and business models, such as telemarketing and call centers.\n\n## Housewives\n\nThe telephone has also played a significant role in the lives of housewives, providing a means of socializing and connecting with others. In the mid-20th century, the telephone became an essential tool for housewives, enabling them to manage household tasks, communicate with family members, and connect with friends.\n\n## Gender and culture roles\n\nThe telephone has also been shaped by and has reflected gender and culture roles in the United States. For example, women have historically been more likely to use the telephone for social purposes, while men have used it more for business and work-related purposes.\n\n## Telemarketing\n\nTelemarketing, which involves using the telephone to sell products or services, has become a major industry in the United States. Telemarketing has been used for a wide range of purposes, including selling products, conducting surveys, and raising funds for charities.\n\n## 9-1-1\n\nThe development of the 9-1-1 emergency service has revolutionized the way people respond to emergencies. The service, which was introduced in the 1960s, enables people to quickly and easily contact emergency services, such as police, fire, and ambulance.\n\n## Harassing calls\n\nThe telephone has also been used for harassing and unwanted calls, which can be a significant problem for individuals and households. In response to this issue, the telephone industry has developed a range of technologies and services, such as call blocking and caller ID.\n\n## Literary fears\n\nThe telephone has also been the subject of literary fears and anxieties, particularly in the early 20th century. Writers such as Franz Kafka and Thomas Mann explored the theme of the telephone as a symbol of modernity and alienation.\n\n# See also\n\n* History of the telephone\n* AT&T\n* Bell System\n* Cellphone\n* Smartphone\n* Switchboard\n* Telephone operator\n* Telemarketing\n* 9-1-1\n\n# References\n\n# Further reading\n\n## Social and cultural studies\n\n* Fischer, Claude S.

He is a member of the Shiv Sena party and has been a key figure in the state's politics for over two decades.\n\n#Early life\n\nEknath Shinde was born on February 9, 1964, in the Satara district of Maharashtra. His family was involved in farming, and he grew up in a rural setting. Shinde's early education took place in his village, after which he moved to Mumbai to pursue higher studies. He graduated from the Yashwantrao Chavan Maharashtra Open University.\n\n#Early political career\n\n##Entry into politics\n\nShinde's entry into politics was influenced by his association with the Shiv Sena party, which he joined in the 1980s. At the time, the party was led by Bal Thackeray, a prominent figure in Maharashtra's politics. Shinde quickly rose through the ranks, becoming a key organizer and strategist for the party.\n\n###Maharashtra Legislative Assembly & ministries\n\nShinde was first elected to the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly in 2004, representing the Kopri-Pachpakhadi constituency in Thane district. He has since been re-elected four times, in 2009, 2014, 2019, and 2022. During his tenure as a member of the legislative assembly, Shinde has held various ministerial portfolios, including Public Works, Transport, and Urban Development.\n\n##Role in 2022 Maharashtra political crisis\n\nIn June 2022, Shinde played a key role in the Maharashtra political crisis, which led to the collapse of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. The MVA was a coalition of the Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), and Indian National Congress (INC). Shinde, who was then the Urban Development Minister, rebelled against the Shiv Sena leadership, citing differences over the party's alliance with the NCP and INC.\n\n#Chief Minister\n\nOn June 30, 2022, Shinde was sworn in as the 20th Chief Minister of Maharashtra, leading a new government formed by the Shiv Sena (Shinde faction) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).\n\n##Electoral performance\n\nAs Chief Minister, Shinde has focused on improving the state's infrastructure, boosting economic growth, and addressing social issues. His electoral performance has been significant, with the Shiv Sena (Shinde faction) winning several by-elections and local body polls.\n\n#Leader of Shiv Sena\n\n##Shiv Sena leadership dispute\n\nFollowing the 2022 Maharashtra political crisis, a leadership dispute emerged within the Shiv Sena party. Shinde, who had rebelled against the party leadership, claimed to be the rightful leader of the party. However, the Election Commission of India (ECI) recognized Uddhav Thackeray, the son of Bal Thackeray, as the interim president of the party. The dispute is ongoing, with both factions claiming to be the authentic Shiv Sena.\n\n##Political legitimacy\n\nShinde's leadership of the Shiv Sena has been questioned by some, who argue that he does not have the necessary legitimacy to lead the party. However, Shinde has maintained that he has the support of a majority of the party's MLAs and is committed to upholding the party's ideology.\n\n#Personal life\n\nShinde is married to Lata Shinde, and the couple has two sons, Shrikant and Purvesh. He is known to be a simple and down-to-earth person, who is deeply rooted in his rural upbringing.\n\n#Popular culture\n\nShinde has been featured in several Marathi films and television shows, where he has been portrayed as a strong and decisive leader. His rise to power has been the subject of much speculation and debate in the media.\n\n#References\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)\n\n#External links\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Eknath_Shinde\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n#Early political career\n##Entry into politics\n###Maharashtra Legislative Assembly & ministries\n##Role in 2022 Maharashtra political crisis\n#Chief Minister\n##Electoral performance\n#Leader of Shiv Sena\n##Shiv Sena leadership dispute\n##Political legitimacy\n#Personal life\n#Popular culture\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The town is situated in the Darjeeling Himalayan hill region, which is part of the Eastern Himalayas.

The film stars David Harbour as a rough-around-the-edges Santa Claus who must fight to save a wealthy family from a group of mercenaries on Christmas Eve. With its unique blend of holiday cheer and high-octane action, Violent Night has become a surprise hit among audiences and critics alike.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe film takes place on Christmas Eve, where a wealthy family, the Gerbers, have gathered at their estate to celebrate the holiday. However, their festivities are disrupted by a group of mercenaries, led by the ruthless Scrooge, who have infiltrated the mansion with the intention of stealing the family's vast fortune.\n\nAs the mercenaries begin to take the family hostage, a rough-around-the-edges Santa Claus, played by David Harbour, arrives on the scene. Initially thought to be just a harmless old man in a red suit, Santa soon proves himself to be a force to be reckoned with, using his unique set of skills to take down the mercenaries one by one.\n\nAs the night wears on, Santa becomes an unlikely ally to the Gerber family's young daughter, Trudy, who has been trying to get her family to rediscover the true meaning of Christmas. Together, Santa and Trudy work to take down the mercenaries and save the family from certain destruction.\n\n# Cast\n\n* David Harbour as Santa Claus\n* John Leguizamo as Jimmy\n* Beverly D'Angelo as Gertrude Gerber\n* Alex Hassell as Scrooge\n* Alexis Louder as Margie\n* Edi Patterson as Alva Gerber\n* Brendan Fletcher as Krampus\n* Leah Brady as Trudy Gerber\n\n# Production\n\n## Development\n\nThe idea for Violent Night was first conceived by writers Pat Casey and Josh Miller, who were looking to create a unique holiday film that combined elements of action and comedy. The pair drew inspiration from classic holiday movies such as Die Hard and Home Alone, as well as more modern action films like John Wick.\n\nThe script was initially pitched to several studios, but it wasn't until it landed on the desk of 87North Productions that the project really began to gain traction. The production company, which is known for its work on films like Atomic Blonde and Deadpool 2, saw the potential for Violent Night to become a holiday classic and quickly attached director Tommy Wirkola to the project.\n\n## Filming\n\nPrincipal photography on Violent Night took place in the spring of 2021, with filming locations including Atlanta, Georgia, and Vancouver, British Columbia. The film's production team worked closely with Harbour to develop his character's unique look and personality, which blends a rough-around-the-edges sensibility with a more traditional Santa Claus persona.\n\nThe film's action sequences were choreographed by the 87North team, which used a combination of stunt work and practical effects to bring the film's high-octane fight scenes to life. Harbour performed many of his own stunts, which added to the film's authenticity and sense of realism.\n\n# Release\n\nViolent Night was released in theaters on December 2, 2022, by Universal Pictures. The film was initially expected to perform modestly at the box office, but it quickly exceeded expectations, thanks in part to positive word-of-mouth and a well-received marketing campaign.\n\n## Home media\n\nViolent Night was released on digital platforms on January 17, 2023, and on Blu-ray and DVD on February 7, 2023. The film's home media release included a number of bonus features, including deleted scenes, behind-the-scenes footage, and a making-of documentary.\n\n# Reception\n\n## Box office\n\nViolent Night was a surprise hit at the box office, grossing over $75 million worldwide on a budget of just $20 million. The film's success can be attributed in part to its unique blend of holiday cheer and high-octane action, which appealed to a wide range of audiences.\n\n## Critical response\n\nViolent Night received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the film's originality, action sequences, and performances. The film holds a 72% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with many critics noting that it is a fun and entertaining holiday film that is well worth watching.\n\n# Sequel\n\nIn the wake of Violent Night's success, there have been reports of a potential sequel in the works. While nothing has been officially announced, writer Pat Casey has stated that he and Josh Miller have already begun working on a script for a follow-up film.\n\n# See also\n\n* Die Hard\n* Home Alone\n* John Wick\n* Atomic Blonde\n* Deadpool 2\n\n# References\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements of the assignment.)\n\n# External links\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements of the assignment.)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Violent_Night\" following this outline:\n\n#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production\n##Development\n##Filming\n#Release\n##Home media\n#Reception\n##Box office\n##Critical response\n#Sequel\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

With a career spanning over four decades, O'Connor has established herself as a unique and influential figure in the music industry.\n\n#Early life and education\n\nSinéad O'Connor was born on December 8, 1970, in Glenageary, County Dublin, Ireland. Her parents, Sean O'Connor and Marie O'Connor, were a structural engineer and a dressmaker, respectively. O'Connor's early life was marked by a troubled home environment, with her parents divorcing when she was eight years old. She was subsequently sent to live with her mother, who struggled with addiction and depression.\n\nO'Connor attended St. Louis High School in Rathmines, Dublin, where she developed an interest in music and began writing her own songs. After completing her secondary education, O'Connor attended the College of Music in Dublin, but dropped out after a year to pursue a career in music.\n\n#Music career\n\n##1980s\n\nO'Connor's music career began in the late 1980s, when she formed a band called Ton Ton Macoute with a group of friends. The band played gigs in local Dublin venues, but eventually disbanded due to creative differences. O'Connor then began performing solo, playing small gigs and open mic nights in Dublin.\n\n##1987–1989: The Lion and the Cobra\n\nIn 1987, O'Connor was signed to Ensign Records and released her debut album, The Lion and the Cobra. The album was a critical and commercial success, with the single \"Mandinka\" becoming a hit in Ireland and the UK. The album's lyrics explored themes of love, relationships, and social commentary, showcasing O'Connor's unique voice and perspective.\n\n##1990–1993: I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got\n\nO'Connor's second album, I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got, was released in 1990 and became a global success, selling over 7 million copies worldwide. The album included the hit singles \"Nothing Compares 2 U\" and \"The Last Day of Our Acquaintance\". The album's lyrics were more introspective and personal, dealing with themes of love, loss, and self-discovery.\n\n###Saturday Night Live protest\n\nIn 1992, O'Connor appeared on Saturday Night Live, where she performed a rendition of Bob Marley's \"War\". During the performance, O'Connor held up a photograph of Pope John Paul II, ripped it in half, and said \"Fight the real enemy\". The incident sparked widespread controversy and outrage, with many condemning O'Connor's actions as blasphemous and anti-Catholic.\n\n##1993–2000\n\nIn the mid-1990s, O'Connor released two more albums, Universal Mother (1994) and Gospel Oak (1997). Both albums received critical acclaim, but failed to match the commercial success of her earlier work. O'Connor also began to explore other creative outlets, including acting and writing.\n\n##2000s\n\nIn the 2000s, O'Connor released two more albums, Faith and Courage (2000) and Sean-Nós Nua (2002). The latter album was a collection of traditional Irish songs, which O'Connor had always been passionate about. The album received critical acclaim and helped to introduce O'Connor's music to a new audience.\n\n##2010s\n\nIn 2012, O'Connor released her ninth studio album, How About I Be Me (And You Be You)?. The album was a return to form for O'Connor, with many praising her renewed energy and creativity. The album included the hit single \"4th and Vine\".\n\n##2020–2023: Memoir and death of son\n\nIn 2021, O'Connor released her memoir, Rememberings, which detailed her life, career, and struggles with addiction and mental health. The book received widespread critical acclaim and helped to cement O'Connor's status as a literary figure.\n\nTragically, in 2023, O'Connor's 17-year-old son, Shane O'Connor, died by suicide. The incident shocked fans and the music industry, with many paying tribute to O'Connor and her family.\n\n#Personal life\n\n##Marriages and children\n\nO'Connor has been married four times: to John Reynolds (1989-1991), Nick Sommerlad (2001-2002), Steve Cooney (2010-2011), and Barry Herridge (2011-2012). She has four children: Jake Reynolds (born 1987), Róisín Waters (born 1996), Shane O'Connor (1999-2023), and Yeshua Bonadio (born 2006).\n\n##Other relationships\n\nO'Connor has been open about her struggles with addiction and mental health, and has been in recovery for many years. She has also been involved in various high-profile relationships, including with musician John Grant and comedian Ardal O'Hanlon.\n\n##Homes\n\nO'Connor has lived in various locations throughout her life, including Dublin, London, and New York. She currently resides in London.\n\n##Sexuality\n\nO'Connor has been open about her bisexuality and has been an advocate for LGBTQ+ rights.\n\n##Politics\n\nO'Connor has been an outspoken critic of the Catholic Church and has been involved in various social justice campaigns, including advocating for women's rights and opposing racism.\n\n##Religion\n\nO'Connor was raised Catholic, but has since renounced the faith and converted to Islam. She has been open about her spiritual journey and has spoken about the importance of faith in her life.\n\n##Health\n\nO'Connor has been open about her struggles with addiction and mental health, and has been in recovery for many years. She has also been open about her experiences with fibromyalgia and other health issues.\n\n##Death\n\nOn July 26, 2023, Sinéad O'Connor announced that she had passed away, but later revealed that this was an error and that she was alive. The incident sparked widespread confusion and concern, with many fans and well-wishers sending messages of support to O'Connor.\n\n#Tributes\n\nThroughout her career, O'Connor has been the subject of various tributes and accolades, including being named one of the greatest singers of all time by Rolling Stone magazine.\n\n#In popular culture\n\nO'Connor's music and image have been referenced in various forms of popular culture, including in TV shows, films, and literature.

He is also the founder of Alameda Research, a quantitative trading firm. Bankman-Fried has been a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency and finance industries, known for his advocacy of effective altruism and his involvement in various philanthropic efforts. However, his career has been marred by controversy, including the bankruptcy of FTX and subsequent arrest on charges of fraud and money laundering.\n\nEarly life and education\n------------------------\n\nSam Bankman-Fried was born on March 6, 1992, in Stanford, California. His parents, Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, are both professors at Stanford Law School. Bankman-Fried grew up in a family of academics and was raised with a strong emphasis on social responsibility and philanthropy. He attended Crystal Springs Uplands School in Hillsborough, California, and later enrolled at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he studied physics and graduated in 2014.\n\nCareer\n--------\n\nAfter graduating from MIT, Bankman-Fried began his career in finance as a trader at Jane Street, a quantitative trading firm. In 2017, he left Jane Street to found Alameda Research, a quantitative trading firm that focused on cryptocurrency and other digital assets. The firm quickly gained a reputation for its sophisticated trading strategies and its ability to generate significant returns.\n\nIn 2019, Bankman-Fried founded FTX, a cryptocurrency derivatives exchange that quickly gained popularity among traders and investors. FTX was known for its innovative products, including perpetual swaps and options, as well as its user-friendly interface and robust risk management systems. Under Bankman-Fried's leadership, FTX grew rapidly and became one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world.\n\n### Views on charity and market regulation\n\nBankman-Fried has been a vocal advocate of effective altruism, a philosophy that emphasizes the use of reason and evidence to maximize positive impact. He has stated that he believes in giving away the majority of his wealth during his lifetime and has pledged to donate at least 50% of his net worth to charitable causes.\n\nBankman-Fried has also been a vocal advocate of stricter regulation of the cryptocurrency markets. He has argued that the lack of regulation in the industry has led to widespread abuse and has called for greater oversight and transparency.\n\n### Bankruptcy of FTX\n\nIn November 2022, FTX filed for bankruptcy and ceased operations. The collapse of the exchange was attributed to a liquidity crisis, which was triggered by a series of events, including a withdrawal of funds by customers and a decline in the value of the exchange's native token, FTT.\n\nThe bankruptcy of FTX was widely seen as a major blow to the cryptocurrency industry and led to a significant decline in the value of many digital assets. It also raised questions about the stability and security of the cryptocurrency markets and led to calls for greater regulation and oversight.\n\nArrest and charges\n------------------\n\nOn December 12, 2022, Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas and charged with wire fraud, securities fraud, and money laundering. The charges were brought by the U.S. Department of Justice and centered on allegations that Bankman-Fried had used customer funds to finance his own trading activities and had made false statements to investors.\n\nUnited States v. Bankman-Fried\n-----------------------------\n\n### Trial conclusion\n\nBankman-Fried's trial concluded on February 27, 2023, with a guilty verdict on all charges. The jury found that Bankman-Fried had indeed used customer funds to finance his own trading activities and had made false statements to investors.\n\n### Second trial dismissed\n\nIn March 2023, a second trial against Bankman-Fried was dismissed due to lack of evidence. The trial had centered on allegations that Bankman-Fried had made false statements to investors and had used customer funds to finance his own trading activities.\n\n### Appeal\n\nBankman-Fried's lawyers have filed an appeal of the guilty verdict, arguing that the trial was unfair and that the prosecution had presented insufficient evidence.\n\nIncarceration history\n---------------------\n\nBankman-Fried is currently being held at the Federal Correctional Institution in Miami, Florida. He is awaiting sentencing, which is expected to take place in the coming months.\n\nDonations\n------------\n\nBankman-Fried has been a major donor to various charitable causes, including pandemic prevention and animal welfare organizations. He has also donated to various political campaigns and has been a vocal supporter of the Democratic Party.\n\n### Politics\n\n#### 2020 and earlier\n\nBankman-Fried was a vocal supporter of the Democratic Party during the 2020 presidential election.

It is a member of the yew family (Taxaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive, aromatic foliage and red, berry-like cones. The species has been the subject of significant conservation efforts due to its critically endangered status, which has been largely attributed to a combination of factors including habitat loss, disease, and restricted range size.\n\n# Species discovery\n\nTorreya taxifolia was first discovered in the early 19th century by American botanist Hardy Bryan Croom, who encountered the species in the Apalachicola River valley in Florida. At the time, the species was found to be relatively common in the region, with populations extending into southern Georgia and Alabama. However, by the mid-20th century, the species had begun to decline precipitously, and by the 1980s, it was considered to be critically endangered.\n\n# Taxonomy and naming\n\nTorreya taxifolia is a member of the genus Torreya, which is named after American botanist John Torrey. The species was originally described by Croom in 1833 and was subsequently placed in the genus Torreya by Arnott in 1838. The species is also known by its common names, Florida torreya and stinking cedar, the latter of which refers to the distinctive, unpleasant odor of the tree's foliage.\n\n# Type species of genus Torreya\n\nTorreya taxifolia is the type species of the genus Torreya, which includes six other species of coniferous trees. The genus is characterized by its distinctive, yew-like foliage and is found in a range of habitats, including forests, woodlands, and rocky outcrops.\n\n# Common names\n\nTorreya taxifolia is commonly known as the Florida torreya or stinking cedar. The species is also known by a range of other names, including Florida nutmeg, stink cedar, and torreya.\n\n# Description\n\n## Technical description\n\nTorreya taxifolia is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows to a height of 10-15 meters. The tree has a conical crown and a straight, columnar trunk, which is often covered in a thick layer of reddish-brown bark. The leaves are dark green, glossy, and aromatic, with a distinctive, unpleasant odor. The male cones are small and yellowish, while the female cones are red, berry-like, and contain a single seed.\n\n## Subcanopy growth adaptations\n\nTorreya taxifolia is a subcanopy species that is well adapted to growing in the shaded conditions of the forest understory. The tree has a number of adaptations that enable it to thrive in these conditions, including its ability to tolerate low light levels and its production of small, shade-tolerant leaves.\n\n# Distribution\n\n## Wild population\n\nTorreya taxifolia is found in the wild in a restricted range of habitats in the southeastern United States. The species is native to the Apalachicola River valley in Florida, as well as parts of southern Georgia and Alabama. The wild population of the species is estimated to be fewer than 1,000 individuals, making it one of the most endangered tree species in the world.\n\n## Prehistoric distribution\n\nFossil evidence suggests that Torreya taxifolia had a wider distribution in the past, with the species found in a range of habitats across the southeastern United States. However, the species has declined significantly over the past few thousand years, and is now found in a highly restricted range.\n\n# Ecology\n\n## Habitat\n\nTorreya taxifolia is found in a range of habitats, including forests, woodlands, and rocky outcrops. The species is typically found in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade.\n\n## Seed dispersal\n\nThe seeds of Torreya taxifolia are dispersed by birds and small mammals, which eat the red, berry-like cones and deposit the seeds in new locations.\n\n# Extinction threats\n\n## Vulnerabilities of restricted range size\n\nOne of the main extinction threats facing Torreya taxifolia is its highly restricted range size. The species is found in a limited range of habitats, making it vulnerable to extinction due to habitat loss, disease, and other environmental stressors.\n\n## The die-off begins\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, Torreya taxifolia began to experience a significant decline in population, with many trees dying off due to unknown causes. The die-off continued throughout the 1970s and 1980s, and by the 1990s, the species was considered to be critically endangered.\n\n## The role of pathogens in the die-off\n\nOne of the main causes of the die-off of Torreya taxifolia is thought to be the presence of pathogens, including fungi and bacteria. These pathogens are believed to have been introduced to the species through human activity, such as the introduction of non-native plant species.\n\n## The role of habitat deterioration in the die-off\n\nHabitat deterioration is also thought to have played a role in the die-off of Torreya taxifolia. The species is found in a range of habitats, including forests and woodlands, which have been degraded due to human activity, such as logging and land conversion.\n\n## Focus on a stem canker fungus\n\nOne of the main pathogens thought to be responsible for the die-off of Torreya taxifolia is a stem canker fungus. This fungus is believed to have been introduced to the species through human activity, and is thought to have played a significant role in the decline of the species.\n\n## Ultimate cause of die-off still unsolved\n\nDespite significant research, the ultimate cause of the die-off of Torreya taxifolia remains unsolved. It is likely that the die-off is the result of a combination of factors, including habitat loss, disease, and restricted range size.\n\n# Conservation actions\n\n## Protect areas in species range\n\nOne of the main conservation actions being taken to protect Torreya taxifolia is the protection of areas in the species' range. This includes the establishment of protected areas, such as national parks and wildlife refuges, as well as the protection of private land through conservation easements.\n\n## List the species as endangered\n\nTorreya taxifolia has been listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), which provides protection for the species and its habitat.\n\n## In situ habitat improvement\n\nIn situ habitat improvement is also being used to conserve Torreya taxifolia. This includes the restoration of degraded habitats, as well as the management of invasive species.\n\n## Ex situ genetic safeguarding\n\nEx situ genetic safeguarding is being used to conserve the genetic diversity of Torreya taxifolia. This includes the establishment of seed banks and the cultivation of the species in botanical gardens.\n\n## Document early horticultural plantings\n\nEarly horticultural plantings of Torreya taxifolia are also being documented, which will help to inform conservation efforts and ensure the long-term survival of the species.\n\n# Conservation controversies\n\n## Assisted migration (the policy debate)\n\nOne of the main conservation controversies surrounding Torreya taxifolia is the debate over assisted migration. Assisted migration involves the deliberate movement of a species to a new location, which can help to ensure the long-term survival of the species. However, this approach is also controversial, as it can lead to the introduction of non-native species and the disruption of ecosystems.\n\n## Management of seeds produced ex situ\n\nThe management of seeds produced ex situ is also a conservation controversy surrounding Torreya taxifolia. This includes the question of how to manage seeds produced in botanical gardens and other ex situ conservation programs.\n\n### Seeds produced from official plantings\n\nSeeds produced from official plantings, such as those in botanical gardens, are typically managed through formal conservation programs. These programs help to ensure the long-term survival of the species and the conservation of its genetic diversity.\n\n### Seeds accessed by citizens\n\nSeeds accessed by citizens, such as those obtained through online seed banks, are not always managed through formal conservation programs. This can lead to the introduction of non-native species and the disruption of ecosystems, which can have negative impacts on the long-term survival of Torreya taxifolia.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Torreya_taxifolia\" following this outline:\n\n#Species discovery\n#Taxonomy and naming\n#Type species of genus Torreya\n#Common names\n#Description\n##Technical description\n##Subcanopy growth adaptations\n#Distribution\n##Wild population\n##Prehistoric distribution\n#Ecology\n##Habitat\n##Seed dispersal\n#Extinction threats\n##Vulnerabilities of restricted range size\n##The die-off begins\n##The role of pathogens in the die-off\n##The role of habitat deterioration in the die-off\n##Focus on a stem canker fungus\n##Ultimate cause of die-off still unsolved\n#Conservation actions\n##Protect areas in species range\n##List the species as endangered\n##In situ habitat improvement\n##Ex situ genetic safeguarding\n##Document early horticultural plantings\n#Conservation controversies\n##Assisted migration (the policy debate)\n##Management of seeds produced ex situ\n###Seeds produced from official plantings\n###Seeds accessed by citizens\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is native to the Mediterranean region and has been naturalized in parts of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant has a long history of use in traditional medicine and has been the subject of scientific study due to its unique characteristics and properties.\n\nScientific Name\n---------------\n\nThe scientific name of the species is Anagyris foetida. It belongs to the genus Anagyris, which is a small group of flowering plants in the legume family.\n\nCommon Names\n-------------\n\nAnagyris foetida is commonly known as the stinking bean trefoil or the Mediterranean stink bean. The plant gets its name from the strong, unpleasant odor of its flowers and foliage.\n\nDistribution\n------------\n\nAnagyris foetida is native to the Mediterranean region, where it can be found growing in dry, scrubby areas and along roadsides. The plant has been naturalized in parts of Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and can also be found in Australia and the United States.\n\nHabitat\n---------\n\nAnagyris foetida grows in dry, well-drained soils and can thrive in areas with poor soil quality. The plant is often found in scrubby areas, along roadsides, and in abandoned fields. It can also grow in rocky areas and on hillsides.\n\nAdaptations to Growth in Winter and Early Spring\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nAnagyris foetida has several adaptations that allow it to thrive in the winter and early spring months. One of the most notable is its ability to produce flowers and foliage during this time, when many other plants are dormant.\n\n### Summer Leaf-Fall\n\nOne of the unique characteristics of Anagyris foetida is its ability to shed its leaves during the summer months. This adaptation allows the plant to conserve water and protect itself from the hot, dry conditions of the Mediterranean summer.\n\n### Pollination by Birds\n\nAnagyris foetida is pollinated by birds, which are attracted to the plant's bright yellow flowers. The plant's flowers are rich in nectar, which provides a source of energy for the birds.\n\nSeed Dispersal\n---------------\n\nAnagyris foetida has several mechanisms for seed dispersal, including soil seed banks, olive mimicry, and the role of sheep and other mammals.\n\n### Soil Seed Banks\n\nAnagyris foetida produces seeds that can remain dormant in the soil for many years. This allows the plant to disperse its seeds over a wide area and ensures that new plants will grow in areas where the conditions are favorable.\n\n### Olive Mimicry\n\nThe seeds of Anagyris foetida are similar in appearance to those of the olive tree, which is a common plant in the Mediterranean region. This similarity allows the seeds of Anagyris foetida to be dispersed by birds and other animals that are attracted to the olive tree.\n\n### Role of Sheep\n\nSheep and other grazing animals play an important role in the dispersal of Anagyris foetida seeds. The seeds are ingested by the animals and then deposited in new areas, often in the form of dung.\n\n### Other Possible Mammalian and Avian Vectors\n\nIn addition to sheep, other mammals and birds may also play a role in the dispersal of Anagyris foetida seeds. These may include rabbits, hares, and other small mammals, as well as birds such as pigeons and doves.\n\n### Unknown Seed Dispersal Vector\n\nDespite its many adaptations for seed dispersal, the exact mechanisms by which Anagyris foetida seeds are dispersed are not fully understood. Further research is needed to determine the role of other animals and environmental factors in the dispersal of this plant.\n\n### Tough, Waterproof Seed Coats\n\nThe seeds of Anagyris foetida have tough, waterproof coats that allow them to survive for many years in the soil. This adaptation allows the plant to disperse its seeds over a wide area and ensures that new plants will grow in areas where the conditions are favorable.\n\nValue as a Nitrogen-Fixing Pioneer and Companion Plant\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnagyris foetida is a nitrogen-fixing plant, which means that it has the ability to convert atmospheric nitrogen into a form that can be used by other plants. This makes it a valuable companion plant for other crops, as it can help to improve soil fertility and reduce the need for fertilizers.\n\nMedicinal Use\n-------------\n\nAnagyris foetida has been used in traditional medicine for many years, particularly in the Mediterranean region. The plant has been used to treat a variety of ailments, including fever, rheumatism, and skin conditions.\n\nToxicity\n---------\n\nDespite its medicinal uses, Anagyris foetida is a toxic plant that should be handled with caution. The plant contains a number of toxic compounds, including alkaloids and glycosides.\n\n### Alkaloid Anagyrine a Cause of Birth Defects\n\nOne of the toxic compounds found in Anagyris foetida is the alkaloid anagyrine, which has been shown to cause birth defects in animals. This has raised concerns about the potential risks of using the plant in traditional medicine.\n\n### Danger to Children\n\nAnagyris foetida is a particular danger to children, who may be attracted to the plant's bright yellow flowers and ingest the toxic seeds or foliage.\n\n### Hazardous Tainting of Milk Products\n\nThe toxic compounds found in Anagyris foetida can also contaminate milk products, posing a risk to human health.\n\n### Case of Accidental Poisoning in Algeria\n\nThere have been reports of accidental poisoning from Anagyris foetida in Algeria, where the plant is commonly used in traditional medicine. In one case, a person died after ingesting a tea made from the plant.\n\nCultural References: Anagyris and Anagyrous\n------------------------------------------\n\nAnagyris foetida has been referenced in a number of cultural and literary works, including the ancient Greek play \"Lysistrata\" by Aristophanes.\n\n### Lysistrata\n\nIn \"Lysistrata,\" the plant is mentioned as a symbol of female fertility and power.\n\n### Persistence of Name\n\nThe name \"Anagyris\" has persisted in Western culture, and is still used today to refer to the plant.\n\nGallery\n--------\n\n### Anagyris foetida\n\n* Image of Anagyris foetida in flower\n* Close-up of Anagyris foetida flowers\n* Image of Anagyris foetida foliage\n\n### Avian Pollinators\n\n* Image of a bird pollinating Anagyris foetida\n* Close-up of a bird's beak covered in Anagyris foetida pollen\n\n### Avian Nectar Thief\n\n* Image of a bird stealing nectar from Anagyris foetida\n* Close-up of a bird's beak inserted into Anagyris foetida flower\n\n### Insect Pollinators\n\n* Image of an insect pollinating Anagyris foetida\n* Close-up of an insect's body covered in Anagyris foetida pollen\n\nSee Also\n--------\n\n* List of plants in the Fabaceae family\n* List of nitrogen-fixing plants\n* List of toxic plants", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Anagyris_foetida\" following this outline:\n\n#Scientific Name\n#Common names\n#Distribution\n#Habitat\n#Adaptations to growth in Winter and early Spring\n##Summer leaf-fall\n##Pollination by birds\n#Seed dispersal\n##Soil seed banks\n##Olive mimicry\n##Role of sheep\n##Other possible mammalian and avian vectors\n##Unknown seed dispersal vector\n##Tough, waterproof seed coats\n#Value as a nitrogen-fixing pioneer and companion plant\n#Medicinal use\n#Toxicity\n##Alkaloid anagyrine a cause of birth defects\n##Danger to children\n##Hazardous tainting of milk products\n##Case of accidental poisoning in Algeria\n#Cultural references: Anagyris and Anagyrous\n##Lysistrata\n##Persistence of name\n#Gallery\n##Anagyris foetida\n##Avian pollinators\n##Avian nectar thief\n##Insect pollinators\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

In 2016, the company launched Titan, a submersible capable of taking five people to the wreck of the Titanic. Titan was designed to be a state-of-the-art submersible, with advanced life support systems and a large viewing window. Over the next several years, OceanGate conducted a number of expeditions to the Titanic, taking scientists, researchers, and explorers to the wreck site.\n\n### 2023: Implosion of Titan and death of Rush\n\nOn June 18, 2023, tragedy struck when Titan imploded while on a dive to the Titanic wreck site. The submersible was carrying five people, including Stockton Rush, the founder and CEO of OceanGate. All five occupants were killed in the accident. The cause of the implosion is still under investigation.\n\nSubmersibles\n------------\n\n### Antipodes\n\nAntipodes is a single-person submersible designed by Chris Haskins. The submersible has a cylindrical hull and a state-of-the-art life support system. Antipodes has been used for a number of expeditions, including a dive to the wreck of the Titanic.\n\n### Cyclops 1\n\nCyclops 1 is a five-person submersible designed and built by OceanGate. The submersible has a spherical hull and a state-of-the-art life support system. Cyclops 1 is capable of taking people to the ocean floor, including the wreck of the Titanic.\n\n### Titan\n\nTitan is a five-person submersible designed and built by OceanGate. The submersible has a state-of-the-art life support system and a large viewing window. Titan was designed to take people to the wreck of the Titanic and was used for a number of expeditions before its tragic implosion in 2023.\n\nAssociated Entities\n------------------\n\nOceanGate has partnered with a number of organizations and companies to provide its submersible services. These partners include research institutions, museums, and adventure tourism companies.\n\nSee Also\n--------\n\n* Deep-sea submersible\n* Manned submersible\n* Ocean exploration\n* Titanic wreck site\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n*Note: This article does not include citations or references.
