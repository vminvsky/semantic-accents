The scheme, announced on June 14, 2022, aims to transform the Indian military into a modern, tech-savvy force, with a focus on merit-based recruitment and a reduced tenure of service.\n\n# Background\nThe Indian Armed Forces have been facing challenges in terms of modernization, with an aging population and a large number of personnel set to retire in the coming years. The forces have also been facing difficulties in attracting and retaining young talent, with many opting for alternative career options. The Agnipath Scheme aims to address these challenges by offering a new recruitment model that is more attractive to young Indians.\n\n# Overview\nThe Agnipath Scheme offers recruitment for four years, with an option for 25% of recruits to be retained for a further 15 years. The recruits, known as \"Agniveers,\" will undergo training and serve in various roles, including combat, technical, and administrative positions. The scheme aims to recruit 46,000 personnel in the first year, with a target of 50,000 recruits per year over the next four years.\n\n# Reservation and welfare benefits\nThe Agnipath Scheme offers various benefits to recruits, including a salary package, medical facilities, and insurance coverage. The scheme also provides for reservation for ex-servicemen and their families in various government jobs and educational institutions. The government has also announced plans to provide financial assistance to Agniveers after their four-year tenure, to help them transition to civilian life.\n\n# Criticism\nThe Agnipath Scheme has faced criticism from various quarters, including political parties, retired defense personnel, and state governments.\n\n## By political parties and activists\nOpposition parties have criticized the scheme, arguing that it will lead to the \" contractualization\" of the armed forces and undermine the morale of serving personnel. Some have also questioned the wisdom of recruiting personnel for a short tenure, arguing that it will lead to a lack of continuity and institutional memory.\n\n## By retired defence personnel\nRetired defense personnel have also expressed concerns about the scheme, arguing that it will lead to a decrease in the quality of recruits and undermine the reputation of the armed forces. Some have also questioned the government's decision to reduce the tenure of service, arguing that it will lead to a lack of experience and expertise among personnel.\n\n## By state governments\nState governments have also expressed concerns about the scheme, arguing that it will lead to a shortage of personnel in various states. Some have also questioned the government's decision to reserve 25% of recruits for a further 15 years, arguing that it will lead to a lack of opportunities for new recruits.\n\n## Data on employment of veterans\nData on the employment of veterans has also raised concerns about the effectiveness of the scheme. According to various reports, a large number of ex-servicemen are struggling to find employment after leaving the armed forces, with many facing difficulties in adjusting to civilian life.\n\n# Protests\nThe Agnipath Scheme has faced widespread protests across the country, with many young Indians taking to the streets to express their opposition to the scheme.\n\n## Bharat Bandh (All India Strike)\nThe protests began with a Bharat Bandh (All India Strike) on June 20, 2022, with many opposition parties and trade unions participating in the strike. The strike led to widespread disruptions across the country, with many trains and buses being cancelled or delayed.\n\n## 21 June onwards\nThe protests continued on June 21, 2022, with many young Indians taking to the streets to express their opposition to the scheme. The protests turned violent in many places, with many police personnel and protesters being injured.\n\n# Response by the Government\nThe government has responded to the protests by announcing various concessions and incentives for Agniveers. The government has also announced plans to increase the tenure of service for Agniveers, from four years to five years.\n\n# Plea in the Supreme Court against the scheme\nA plea has been filed in the Supreme Court against the Agnipath Scheme, arguing that it is unconstitutional and violative of the fundamental rights of citizens. The court has yet to hear the plea.\n\n# First Agniveer batch (2023)\nThe first batch of Agniveers is set to commence training in 2023, with many young Indians having already been recruited under the scheme.\n\n## Hyderabad\nThe first batch of Agniveers will commence training at the Air Force Academy in Hyderabad, with many young Indians having already reported for duty.\n\n## Nashik\nThe second batch of Agniveers will commence training at the Artillery Centre in Nashik, with many young Indians having already reported for duty.\n\n## Ranikhet\nThe third batch of Agniveers will commence training at the Kumaon Regimental Centre in Ranikhet, with many young Indians having already reported for duty.\n\n# Amendment in recruitment procedure\nThe government has announced plans to amend the recruitment procedure for Agniveers, to make it more transparent and merit-based.\n\n# See also\n* Indian Armed Forces\n* Ministry of Defence (India)\n* Recruitment in the Indian Armed Forces\n\n# References\n\n# External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Agnipath_Scheme\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Overview\n#Reservation and welfare benefits\n#Criticism\n##By political parties and activists\n##By retired defence personnel\n##By state governments\n##Data on employment of veterans\n#Protests\n##Bharat Bandh (All India Strike)\n##21 June onwards\n#Response by the Government\n#Plea in the Supreme Court against the scheme\n#First Agniveer batch (2023)\n##Hyderabad\n##Nashik\n##Ranikhet\n#Amendment in recruitment procedure\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The event sparked widespread outrage, protests, and debates about police brutality, racism, and immigration in France. This article provides an overview of the incident, its background, and the subsequent reactions.\n\n# Background\n\nNanterre is a commune in the Hauts-de-Seine department in the Île-de-France region of northern France. The area has a diverse population, with a significant proportion of residents from immigrant backgrounds. Tensions between law enforcement and the local community have been reported in the past, with some residents accusing the police of racial profiling and heavy-handedness.\n\n# Victim\n\nNahel Merzouk was a 17-year-old French teenager of Algerian descent. He was a student at a local high school and was known to his friends and family as a calm and reserved individual. Merzouk was also an avid soccer player and had a passion for music.\n\n# Shooting\n\nOn June 27, 2023, Nahel Merzouk was shot and killed by a police officer in Nanterre. The circumstances surrounding the shooting are disputed, with different accounts emerging from the prosecution, police, and witnesses.\n\n## Prosecution version\n\nAccording to the prosecution, Merzouk was driving a car with two passengers when he was stopped by police for a traffic violation. The officers alleged that Merzouk attempted to flee the scene, and one of the officers fired a warning shot into the air. The prosecution claims that Merzouk then accelerated the car towards the officer, who fired a second shot that hit Merzouk in the chest.\n\n## Police version challenged by a video\n\nHowever, a video of the incident, captured by a bystander, appears to contradict the police account. The video shows the police car pulling over Merzouk's vehicle, and the officers approaching the car with their guns drawn. The video then shows one of the officers firing a shot into the car, followed by Merzouk's vehicle slowly rolling forward before coming to a stop. The video does not show Merzouk accelerating the car towards the officer.\n\n## Version from the third passenger\n\nOne of the passengers in Merzouk's car, who wishes to remain anonymous, has provided a different account of the events. According to this witness, Merzouk was stopped by police for a minor traffic infraction, and the officers became aggressive and began yelling at Merzouk. The witness claims that Merzouk attempted to explain himself, but the officers continued to escalate the situation, eventually leading to the shooting.\n\n# Investigation\n\nThe incident is currently under investigation by the French authorities, including the National Police Inspectorate General (IGPN) and the Paris prosecutor's office. The investigation is ongoing, and no official conclusions have been reached.\n\n# Initial reactions\n\nThe killing of Nahel Merzouk sparked widespread outrage and condemnation from the local community, civil rights groups, and politicians.\n\n## Polemics on immigration\n\nThe incident has also reignited debates about immigration and racism in France. Some politicians and commentators have linked the shooting to issues of immigration and crime, while others have argued that the incident is a symptom of a broader problem of police brutality and systemic racism.\n\n# Unrest\n\nIn the days following the shooting, protests and unrest broke out in Nanterre and other suburbs of Paris. Demonstrators clashed with police, and several businesses and vehicles were damaged. The unrest has since subsided, but tensions remain high in the community.\n\n# See also\n\n* Police brutality in France\n* Racism in France\n* Immigration to France\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is based on publicly available information and may not reflect the full complexity of the incident.\n\n# References\n\nNone\n\n# External links\n\nNone", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Killing_of_Nahel_Merzouk\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Victim\n#Shooting\n##Prosecution version\n##Police version challenged by a video\n##Version from the third passenger\n#Investigation\n#Initial reactions\n##Polemics on immigration\n#Unrest\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Fenwick_tree", "content": "#Motivation\n#Description\n##The interrogation tree\n##The update tree\n##The search tree\n#Pseudocode\n##Construction\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Fenwick Tree\n================\n\nA Fenwick tree, also known as a binary indexed tree, is a data structure used to efficiently calculate prefix sums and range sums in an array. It was first described by Peter Fenwick in 1994. The Fenwick tree is particularly useful in scenarios where the array is frequently updated and queried, as it allows for both operations to be performed in logarithmic time.\n\nMotivation\n-----------\n\nWhen dealing with large arrays, calculating prefix sums or range sums can be a computationally expensive operation. A naive approach would involve iterating over the entire array, resulting in a time complexity of O(n). This can be impractical for large datasets or applications where speed is critical. The Fenwick tree addresses this issue by providing a data structure that can efficiently calculate prefix sums and range sums in logarithmic time.\n\nDescription\n-----------\n\nA Fenwick tree is a tree-like data structure that consists of nodes, each representing a range of values in the original array. The tree is constructed by dividing the array into smaller segments, with each segment represented by a node in the tree. The value stored in each node is the cumulative sum of the values in its corresponding segment.\n\n### The Interrogation Tree\n\nThe interrogation tree is a tree-like structure that represents the segments of the original array. Each node in the interrogation tree corresponds to a segment of the array and stores the cumulative sum of the values in that segment. The interrogation tree is used to calculate prefix sums and range sums by traversing the tree and accumulating the values in the nodes.\n\n### The Update Tree\n\nThe update tree is a companion tree to the interrogation tree. It is used to update the values in the original array by propagating the changes through the tree. The update tree is essential for maintaining the integrity of the Fenwick tree when the underlying array is modified.\n\n### The Search Tree\n\nThe search tree is a tree-like structure that represents the ranges of values in the original array. Each node in the search tree corresponds to a range of values and stores the cumulative sum of the values in that range. The search tree is used to calculate range sums by traversing the tree and accumulating the values in the nodes.\n\nPseudocode\n----------\n\nThe following pseudocode illustrates the construction of a Fenwick tree:\n```\nfunction constructFenwickTree(arr):\n  n = length(arr)\n  tree = new array of size n + 1\n  for i from 1 to n:\n    tree[i] = arr[i]\n  for i from 1 to n:\n    j = i + (i & -i)\n    if j <= n:\n      tree[j] += tree[i]\n  return tree\n```\nThis pseudocode constructs a Fenwick tree by initializing the tree with the values from the original array and then propagating the values through the tree using the update tree.\n\nConstruction\n------------\n\nThe construction of a Fenwick tree involves the following steps:\n\n1. Initialize the tree with the values from the original array.\n2. Propagate the values through the tree using the update tree.\n3. Calculate the prefix sums and range sums using the interrogation tree and search tree.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Prefix sum\n* Range sum\n* Binary indexed tree\n* Cumulative sum\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n* Fenwick, P.

The film stars Michelle Yeoh, Ke Huy Quan, Jenny Slate, and Jamie Lee Curtis, and follows the story of a Chinese-American woman who discovers she can access parallel universes.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe film follows Evelyn Wang (Michelle Yeoh), a middle-aged Chinese-American woman who is struggling to balance her life. She is being audited by the IRS, her laundromat business is failing, and she is on the verge of divorcing her husband, Waymond (Ke Huy Quan). During an audit meeting, Evelyn is suddenly thrust into a multiverse, where she can access parallel universes and alternate versions of herself.\n\nAs Evelyn navigates the multiverse, she encounters various versions of herself, each living different lives. She must also confront a powerful villain known as \"Jobu Tupaki,\" who is threatening the fabric of the multiverse. Along the way, Evelyn discovers that she has the ability to \"verse-jump,\" allowing her to access different parallel universes and switch between them seamlessly.\n\nWith the help of her husband and a group of allies from different universes, Evelyn must stop Jobu Tupaki and save the multiverse. Along the way, she must also confront her own personal demons and learn to accept herself and her place in the world.\n\n# Cast\n\n* Michelle Yeoh as Evelyn Wang\n* Ke Huy Quan as Waymond Wang\n* Jenny Slate as Big Nose\n* Jamie Lee Curtis as Deirdre Beaubeirdre\n* Stephanie Hsu as Joy Wang / Jobu Tupaki\n* Harry Shum Jr. as Chad\n* Tallie Medel as Becky\n* Audrey Wasilewski as Alpha\n\n# Production\n\n## Development\n\nThe idea for Everything Everywhere All at Once was born out of a conversation between Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, who were brainstorming ideas for a film. Kwan had been fascinated by the concept of the multiverse, and Scheinert had been experimenting with absurd humor in his previous work. The two filmmakers combined their ideas and began writing the script, which would eventually become Everything Everywhere All at Once.\n\n## Casting\n\nMichelle Yeoh was the first actress to be cast in the film, and she was a major draw for the project. Yeoh had previously worked with the Daniels on their 2016 film Swiss Army Man, and she was eager to collaborate with them again. Ke Huy Quan, who had previously appeared in films such as The Goonies and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, was cast as Waymond Wang, Evelyn's husband.\n\n## Filming\n\nPrincipal photography for Everything Everywhere All at Once began in January 2020 and lasted for 38 days. The film was shot on location in California and Georgia, with additional scenes filmed in Los Angeles and Hong Kong. The Daniels used a combination of practical and visual effects to create the film's elaborate action sequences and multiverse scenes.\n\n## Visual effects\n\nThe visual effects for Everything Everywhere All at Once were created by a team of artists and technicians led by Zak Stoltz and Ethan Feldbau. The team used a combination of computer-generated imagery (CGI) and practical effects to create the film's elaborate action sequences and multiverse scenes. The film's visual effects were praised by critics, who noted their creativity and originality.\n\n# Themes\n\nEverything Everywhere All at Once explores a number of themes, including identity, existentialism, and the multiverse. The film's protagonist, Evelyn Wang, is a complex and multifaceted character who is struggling to find her place in the world. Through her journey, the film explores the idea of identity and how it is shaped by our experiences and relationships.\n\nThe film also explores the concept of the multiverse, which is used as a metaphor for the infinite possibilities and choices that we face in life. The film's use of the multiverse allows the Daniels to explore different genres and styles, from action and comedy to drama and science fiction.\n\n# Music\n\nThe score for Everything Everywhere All at Once was composed by Son Lux, a band that has previously collaborated with the Daniels on their film Swiss Army Man. The score features a combination of electronic and orchestral elements, and it was praised by critics for its creativity and originality. The film's soundtrack also features a number of songs by artists such as Mitski and David Bowie.\n\n# Release\n\n## Theatrical\n\nEverything Everywhere All at Once was released in the United States on March 25, 2022, by A24. The film received a limited release, opening in 10 theaters in New York and Los Angeles. The film expanded to additional theaters in the following weeks, and it eventually played in over 2,000 theaters across the United States.\n\n## Home media\n\nEverything Everywhere All at Once was released on home media on June 7, 2022, by A24 and Lionsgate. The film was released on DVD, Blu-ray, and digital platforms, and it featured a number of bonus features, including deleted scenes and a behind-the-scenes documentary.\n\n# Reception\n\n## Box office\n\nEverything Everywhere All at Once was a commercial success, grossing over $140 million at the box office worldwide. The film's success was driven by positive word-of-mouth and critical acclaim, and it became one of the highest-grossing independent films of 2022.\n\n## Critical response\n\nEverything Everywhere All at Once received widespread critical acclaim, with many critics praising its originality, creativity, and performances. The film holds a 95% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on over 200 reviews, with an average rating of 8.6/10. The critical consensus on the site reads: \"Everything Everywhere All at Once is a wildly inventive and visually stunning film that is full of surprises and delights.\"\n\n## Legacy\n\nEverything Everywhere All at Once has been recognized as a landmark film in the science fiction genre, and it has been praised for its originality and creativity. The film's success has also helped to establish the Daniels as major talents in the film industry, and it has paved the way for future projects.\n\n## Accolades\n\nEverything Everywhere All at Once has received a number of awards and nominations, including several Independent Spirit Awards and a Critics' Choice Movie Award.

Robert Oppenheimer\n\nJulius Robert Oppenheimer, known as J. Robert Oppenheimer, was a renowned American theoretical physicist and director of the Manhattan Project, the secret research and development project that produced the atomic bomb during World War II. He is often referred to as the \"father of the atomic bomb\" for his role in the project. Oppenheimer was a complex figure, whose life was marked by both scientific brilliance and personal turmoil.\n\n#Early life\n\n##Childhood and education\n\nOppenheimer was born on April 22, 1904, in New York City, to Ella and Julius Oppenheimer. His father, a textile importer, was of German Jewish descent, while his mother was a painter. Oppenheimer's early life was marked by a love for learning and a curiosity about the natural world. He attended the Ethical Culture School in New York, where he excelled in mathematics and science.\n\n##Studies in Europe\n\nIn 1921, Oppenheimer traveled to Europe to study at the University of Cambridge, where he was accepted into the prestigious Cavendish Laboratory. However, he soon became disillusioned with the laboratory's emphasis on experimental physics and transferred to the University of Göttingen in Germany, where he studied theoretical physics under the guidance of Max Born. Oppenheimer's time in Europe had a profound impact on his intellectual development, and he became fluent in several languages, including German, French, and Dutch.\n\n#Early career\n\n##Teaching\n\nIn 1929, Oppenheimer returned to the United States and began teaching at the University of California, Berkeley, where he became a popular lecturer and developed a reputation as a brilliant instructor. He also taught at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) and the University of Chicago. Oppenheimer's teaching style was characterized by his enthusiasm, his ability to explain complex concepts in simple terms, and his willingness to challenge his students.\n\n##Scientific work\n\nOppenheimer's research during the 1920s and 1930s focused on quantum mechanics and relativity. He made significant contributions to the field of atomic physics, including the development of the Oppenheimer-Phillips process, which describes the interaction between an atomic nucleus and an electron. Oppenheimer also worked on the theory of black holes and was one of the first scientists to propose the existence of neutron stars.\n\n#Private and political life\n\n##Politics\n\nOppenheimer's politics were shaped by his experiences during the Great Depression and the rise of fascism in Europe. He became increasingly interested in left-wing politics and was a member of several organizations, including the American Communist Party. However, Oppenheimer's involvement with communism was largely intellectual, and he never became a committed party member.\n\n##Relationships and children\n\nIn 1940, Oppenheimer married Katherine \"Kitty\" Posen, a former communist and a woman with a troubled past. The couple had two children, Toni and Peter. Oppenheimer's relationships with his family members were often strained, and he struggled to balance his personal and professional life.\n\n##Mysticism\n\nOppenheimer had a deep interest in Eastern mysticism and philosophy, particularly Hinduism and Buddhism. He saw parallels between the principles of physics and the principles of Eastern thought, and he often incorporated mystical ideas into his lectures and writings.\n\n#Manhattan Project\n\n##Los Alamos\n\nIn 1942, Oppenheimer was recruited to lead the Manhattan Project, a secret research and development project that aimed to produce an atomic bomb. Oppenheimer was chosen for his exceptional leadership skills, his knowledge of physics, and his ability to bring together a team of talented scientists. The project was based in Los Alamos, New Mexico, where Oppenheimer established a research community that became known for its intensity and creativity.\n\n##Bomb design\n\nOppenheimer played a crucial role in the design of the atomic bomb, working closely with scientists such as Enrico Fermi and Ernest Lawrence. He was responsible for overseeing the development of the bomb's physics package, which included the design of the nuclear reactor and the development of the plutonium core.\n\n##Trinity\n\nOn July 16, 1945, Oppenheimer witnessed the first nuclear test, codenamed Trinity, which was conducted in the desert near Alamogordo, New Mexico. The test was a success, and Oppenheimer was overcome with emotion as he watched the mushroom cloud rise into the sky.\n\n#Postwar activities\n\n##Institute for Advanced Study\n\nAfter the war, Oppenheimer became the director of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, where he established a community of scholars that included some of the most prominent scientists and thinkers of the time.\n\n##Atomic Energy Commission\n\nIn 1947, Oppenheimer was appointed to the Atomic Energy Commission, where he played a key role in shaping the United States' nuclear energy policy. He was a strong advocate for international cooperation and arms control, and he worked tirelessly to promote the peaceful use of nuclear energy.\n\n##Panels and study groups\n\nOppenheimer was a member of several panels and study groups, including the General Advisory Committee of the Atomic Energy Commission and the Scientific Advisory Panel of the Office of Defense Mobilization. He used these positions to promote his vision of a more peaceful and cooperative world.\n\n##Security hearing\n\nIn 1954, Oppenheimer's security clearance was revoked due to his past associations with communism and his opposition to the development of the hydrogen bomb. The decision was widely criticized, and Oppenheimer's reputation was severely damaged.\n\n#Final years\n\n##Enrico Fermi Award\n\nIn 1963, Oppenheimer was awarded the Enrico Fermi Award, the highest honor given by the United States government for exceptional contribution to the development of nuclear energy.\n\n#Death\n\nOppenheimer died on February 18, 1967, at the age of 62, due to complications from throat cancer.\n\n#Legacy\n\nOppenheimer's legacy is complex and multifaceted. He will be remembered as a brilliant scientist, a charismatic leader, and a passionate advocate for peace and cooperation. His work on the Manhattan Project changed the course of history, and his contributions to the development of nuclear energy continue to shape our world today.\n\n#Publications\n\nOppenheimer was a prolific writer and published numerous papers and articles on physics, philosophy, and politics. Some of his notable publications include:\n\n* \"The Meaning of Security\" (1947)\n* \"Physics in the Contemporary World\" (1947)\n* \"Prospects in the Arts and Sciences\" (1952)\n* \"The Flying Trapeze: Three Crises for Physicists\" (1964)\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is a comprehensive overview of J. Robert Oppenheimer's life and work. It is based on a wide range of sources, including Oppenheimer's own writings, biographies, and historical accounts.\n\n#References\n\nThis article does not include references or citations.

The club has a rich and storied history, with numerous premierships and notable players contributing to its success over the years. The club's home ground is the Wangaratta Showgrounds, which has a seating capacity of approximately 5,000 spectators.\n\n## Early Years (1874-1900)\n\nThe Wangaratta Football Club was formed in 1874 by a group of local sports enthusiasts. The club's early years were marked by competition in local and regional football competitions, including the Wangaratta District Football Association. In 1880, the club joined the Ovens and Murray Football Association, which later became the Ovens and Murray Football League.\n\n## Golden Era (1900-1945)\n\nThe early 20th century was a golden era for the Wangaratta Football Club. During this period, the club won several premierships, including the 1905, 1911, and 1923 OMFL premierships. The club also produced several notable players, including Jack \"Dookie\" McKenzie, who played for the club from 1905 to 1915 and was a key figure in the club's success during this period.\n\n## Post-War Era (1945-1980)\n\nFollowing World War II, the Wangaratta Football Club experienced a period of rebuilding and consolidation. The club continued to compete in the OMFL and won several premierships, including the 1952 and 1962 premierships. The club also produced several notable players during this period, including Laurie \"Blue\" Nelson, who played for the club from 1947 to 1959 and was a key figure in the club's success during this period.\n\n## Modern Era (1980-Present)\n\nIn the 1980s, the Wangaratta Football Club experienced a period of decline, with the club struggling to compete with other teams in the OMFL. However, in the 1990s, the club began to rebuild and has since become a competitive force in the OMFL. The club has won several premierships, including the 2008 and 2017 premierships, and has produced several notable players, including Shane Wakelin, who played for the club from 2005 to 2015 and was a key figure in the club's success during this period.\n\n# Football Competition Timeline\n\n* 1874: Wangaratta Football Club established\n* 1880: Joined Ovens and Murray Football Association\n* 1900: Ovens and Murray Football Association becomes Ovens and Murray Football League\n* 1950s: Club competes in OMFL and wins several premierships\n* 1980s: Club experiences period of decline\n* 1990s: Club begins to rebuild and becomes competitive force in OMFL\n* 2000s: Club wins several premierships, including 2008 and 2017 premierships\n\n# Football Premierships\n\n* 1905: OMFL premiership\n* 1911: OMFL premiership\n* 1923: OMFL premiership\n* 1952: OMFL premiership\n* 1962: OMFL premiership\n* 2008: OMFL premiership\n* 2017: OMFL premiership\n\n# Football League Best & Fairest Award Winners\n\n* 1952: Laurie \"Blue\" Nelson\n* 1962: Laurie \"Blue\" Nelson\n* 2008: Shane Wakelin\n* 2017: Lachlan Williams\n\n# Team of the Century\n\nIn 2001, the Wangaratta Football Club named its Team of the Century, which included the following players:\n\n* Jack \"Dookie\" McKenzie (1905-1915)\n* Laurie \"Blue\" Nelson (1947-1959)\n* Shane Wakelin (2005-2015)\n* Lachlan Williams (2010-2020)\n* Michael Stevens (1985-1995)\n* Wayne Knee (1965-1975)\n* Richard Brody (1990-2000)\n* Mark Kelly (1975-1985)\n* Peter Gray (1980-1990)\n* Jason Knees (1995-2005)\n\n# Ovens and Murray Football League - Hall of Fame Inductees\n\n* Jack \"Dookie\" McKenzie (2005)\n* Laurie \"Blue\" Nelson (2010)\n* Shane Wakelin (2020)\n\n# VFL / AFL Footballers\n\n* Jack \"Dookie\" McKenzie (played for Collingwood in the VFL from 1906 to 1915)\n* Laurie \"Blue\" Nelson (played for Fitzroy in the VFL from 1950 to 1959)\n* Shane Wakelin (played for Collingwood in the AFL from 2001 to 2009)\n\n# Most Football Games\n\n* Shane Wakelin (246 games for Wangaratta Football Club from 2005 to 2015)\n* Michael Stevens (235 games for Wangaratta Football Club from 1985 to 1995)\n* Lachlan Williams (225 games for Wangaratta Football Club from 2010 to 2020)\n\n# Senior Football Honourboard\n\n* 2008: OMFL premiership\n* 2017: OMFL premiership\n* 2020: OMFL runners-up\n\n# References\n\nNone\n\n# Links\n\n* Wangaratta Football Club official website\n* Ovens and Murray Football League official website\n* Australian Football League official website", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Wangaratta_Football_Club\" following this outline:\n\n#Club History\n#Football competition timeline\n#Football Premierships\n#Football League Best & Fairest Award Winners\n#Team of the Century\n#Ovens and Murray Football League - Hall of Fame Inductees\n#VFL / AFL Footballers\n#Most Football Games\n#Senior Football Honourboard\n#References\n#Links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

From its post-World War II neutrality to its current membership in the alliance, Finland's interactions with NATO have been shaped by its geographic location, historical experiences, and evolving security environment.\n\n# History\n\n## Background: Finnish neutrality at the end of World War II\n\nFollowing World War II, Finland found itself in a unique position, having fought two wars against the Soviet Union – the Winter War (1939-1940) and the Continuation War (1941-1944). The country's relationship with the Soviet Union was formalized through the 1948 Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance, which included a mutual defense commitment. To maintain good relations with the Soviet Union and avoid being drawn into the emerging Cold War, Finland declared itself neutral, a stance that would shape its foreign policy for decades to come.\n\n## 1949–2023: Pre-membership relations\n\n### 1949–1991: Finnish neutrality during the Cold War\n\nThroughout the Cold War, Finland maintained its policy of neutrality, carefully balancing its relationships with the Soviet Union and the Western bloc. The country participated in various international organizations, such as the United Nations, and engaged in diplomatic efforts to promote détente and disarmament. Although Finland was not a member of the Warsaw Pact or NATO, it developed close economic and cultural ties with Western Europe, particularly with Sweden and other Nordic countries.\n\n### 1991–1995: Immediate aftermath of the Cold War\n\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 marked a significant turning point in Finland's foreign policy. As the country began to reassess its security environment, it started to explore new avenues for cooperation with Western countries. In 1992, Finland joined the Western European Union (WEU) as an observer and began to participate in various NATO activities, such as the North Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC). However, the country's non-alignment policy remained in place, and NATO membership was not considered a viable option.\n\n### 1995–2022: Shift from non-alignment within the European Union\n\nFinland's accession to the European Union (EU) in 1995 marked a significant shift in its foreign policy. As a member of the EU, Finland began to participate in the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). While maintaining its non-aligned status, Finland engaged in various EU-led crisis management operations and developed close relationships with other EU member states. However, the country's relationship with NATO remained limited, and membership was not considered a priority.\n\n### 2022–2023: Accession process following the Russian invasion of Ukraine\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 marked a significant turning point in Finland's relationship with NATO. As the country began to reassess its security environment, it started to explore the possibility of NATO membership.\n\n#### February – May 2022: Initial response to the invasion\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the invasion, Finland condemned Russia's actions and began to provide humanitarian assistance to Ukraine. The country also started to enhance its defense capabilities, including increasing its military spending and engaging in joint exercises with NATO member states.\n\n#### May – June 2022: Declaration of intent, application\n\nOn May 12, 2022, Finland's parliament voted in favor of a proposal to consider NATO membership. President Sauli Niinistö and Prime Minister Sanna Marin announced that the country would submit an application to join NATO, which was formally submitted on May 18, 2022.\n\n#### June 2022 – April 2023: Ratification\n\nFollowing the submission of its application, Finland's accession process entered a new phase. The country's parliament approved the accession treaty on March 1, 2023, and the treaty was ratified by all 30 NATO member states on April 4, 2023.\n\n## 2023–present: Finnish membership in NATO\n\nOn April 4, 2023, Finland officially became the 31st member of NATO, marking a significant shift in the country's foreign and security policy. As a member of the alliance, Finland is committed to collective defense and will participate in NATO's decision-making processes.\n\n# Finland's foreign relations with other NATO member states\n\nFinland's membership in NATO has significant implications for its relationships with other member states. The country is expected to develop close relationships with its Nordic neighbors, particularly Norway and Denmark, as well as with other European countries. Finland's participation in NATO's collective defense commitment will also require the country to engage in joint military exercises and operations with other member states.\n\n# See also\n\n* Finland–Russia relations\n* Finland–United States relations\n* NATO enlargement\n* Nordic countries\n\n# References\n\n*Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements.*\n\n# Bibliography\n\n*Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements.*\n\n# External links\n\n*Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements.*", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Finland–NATO_relations\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Background: Finnish neutrality at the end of World War II\n##1949–2023: Pre-membership relations\n###1949–1991: Finnish neutrality during the Cold War\n###1991–1995: Immediate aftermath of the Cold War\n###1995–2022: Shift from non-alignment within the European Union\n###2022–2023: Accession process following the Russian invasion of Ukraine\n####February – May 2022: Initial response to the invasion\n####May – June 2022: Declaration of intent, application\n####June 2022 – April 2023: Ratification\n##2023–present: Finnish membership in NATO\n#Finland's foreign relations with other NATO member states\n#See also\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This term was employed to avoid direct mention of the procedure, which was often stigmatized and subject to various laws and social taboos. The phrase was frequently used in medical and journalistic contexts to convey the nature of the operation without explicitly stating it.\n\n# History\n\nThe history of the \"illegal operation\" euphemism is deeply intertwined with the complex and often contentious history of abortion in the United States.\n\n## Background\n\nDuring the late 19th and early 20th centuries, abortion was increasingly criminalized in the United States, with many states passing laws that prohibited the procedure. As a result, the topic became highly stigmatized, and direct references to abortion were often avoided in polite conversation and public discourse.\n\n## \"The thing that had no name\"\n\nIn the early 20th century, the term \"illegal operation\" emerged as a way to refer to abortion without directly stating it. This phrase was often used in medical and journalistic contexts, where it was necessary to convey the nature of the procedure without explicitly mentioning it. The term was also used in popular culture, such as in film and literature, to hint at the existence of abortion without explicitly depicting it.\n\n## Abortion euphemism elsewhere in print\n\nThe use of euphemisms to refer to abortion was not unique to the United States. In other countries, such as the United Kingdom and Canada, similar phrases were used to avoid direct references to the procedure. For example, in the UK, the term \"unlawful operation\" was commonly used, while in Canada, the phrase \"criminal operation\" was employed.\n\n# Law\n\nThe use of the \"illegal operation\" euphemism was also influenced by the legal status of abortion in the United States. During the mid-20th century, many states had laws that prohibited abortion, except in cases where the mother's life was at risk. As a result, the phrase was often used in legal contexts to refer to the procedure without explicitly stating it.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, the legal status of abortion began to change, with several states liberalizing their laws to allow for the procedure in certain circumstances. The landmark Supreme Court case of Roe v. Wade (1973) further changed the legal landscape, establishing a woman's right to an abortion during the first trimester of pregnancy.\n\n# Art\n\nThe \"illegal operation\" euphemism has also been used in various art forms, including film, television, sculpture, and fiction.\n\n## Film\n\nIn film, the phrase was often used to hint at the existence of abortion without explicitly depicting it. For example, in the 1934 film \"Of Human Bondage,\" the protagonist's girlfriend is shown to be recovering from an \"illegal operation,\" which is implied to be an abortion.\n\n## Television\n\nIn television, the phrase was also used to avoid direct references to abortion. For example, in the 1960s TV series \"Dr. Kildare,\" a character is shown to be recovering from an \"illegal operation,\" which is implied to be an abortion.\n\n## Sculpture\n\nIn sculpture, the phrase has been used to create works that reference the history of abortion. For example, the artist Judy Chicago created a sculpture titled \"The Dinner Party\" (1974-1979), which features a plate dedicated to the history of abortion, including the use of the \"illegal operation\" euphemism.\n\n## Fiction\n\nIn fiction, the phrase has been used to explore the complexities of abortion and the experiences of women who have undergone the procedure. For example, in the novel \"The Girls\" by Emma Cline (2016), the protagonist is shown to be considering an abortion, which is referred to as an \"illegal operation.\"\n\nOverall, the \"illegal operation\" euphemism has played a significant role in the history of abortion in the United States, reflecting the complex and often contentious nature of the issue. While the phrase is no longer commonly used, it remains an important part of the cultural and historical record, serving as a reminder of the ongoing struggles and debates surrounding abortion.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Illegal_operation_(euphemism)\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Background\n##\"The thing that had no name\"\n##Abortion euphemism elsewhere in print\n#Law\n#Art\n##Film\n##Television\n##Sculpture\n##Fiction\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The album marks Beyoncé's first solo studio album in six years, following the release of Lemonade in 2016.\n\n# Background and conception\n\nBeyoncé began working on Renaissance in 2018, shortly after giving birth to her twins, Rumi and Sir. The album's conception was influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused Beyoncé to re-evaluate her priorities and focus on her music. She has stated that the album was inspired by her experiences as a mother, wife, and artist, and that she aimed to create a body of work that would inspire and uplift her audience.\n\nRenaissance was recorded over a period of three years, with Beyoncé working with a variety of collaborators, including producers, songwriters, and musicians. The album's sound is characterized by its fusion of different genres, including Afrobeats, house, disco, and hip-hop.\n\n# Cover artwork\n\nThe cover artwork for Renaissance features a photograph of Beyoncé riding a horse, taken by photographer Carlijn Jacobs. The image is a reference to the work of artist John Collier, who painted a series of works featuring women riding horses in the early 20th century. Beyoncé has stated that she chose the image because it represents her desire to reclaim and reappropriate traditional symbols of power and strength.\n\n# Composition\n\nRenaissance is a concept album that explores themes of love, identity, and empowerment.

Lakshman Kumar under the banner of Prince Pictures, Sardar follows the story of a spy who must navigate a complex web of espionage and deceit to uncover the truth.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe film begins with Inspector Vijay (Karthi) being introduced as a struggling cop who is unable to solve any cases. However, it is soon revealed that Vijay is actually a spy working for the Indian government, using his cover as a police officer to gather intelligence. Vijay's latest mission is to infiltrate a terrorist organization that is planning to disrupt the Indian economy.\n\nAs Vijay delves deeper into the organization, he meets Advocate Shalini (Raashii Khanna) who is also working undercover to gather evidence against the terrorists. The two form an alliance and work together to uncover the truth behind the terrorist plot.\n\nMeanwhile, Vijay's past is slowly revealed through a series of flashbacks. It is shown that Vijay's father, Chandrasekhar (also played by Karthi), was a renowned spy who was killed in action. Vijay's desire for revenge against his father's killers drives him to become a spy himself.\n\nAs the story unfolds, Vijay and Shalini discover that the terrorist plot is more complex than they initially thought. They must use all their skills and resources to stay one step ahead of the terrorists and prevent a catastrophic attack.\n\n# Cast\n\n* Karthi as Inspector Vijay / Chandrasekhar\n* Raashii Khanna as Advocate Shalini\n* Rajisha Vijayan as Nisha\n* Chunky Pandey as Sharma\n* Laila as Siva's wife\n* Murali Sharma as Colonel\n* Avanthika Mohan as Chandrasekhar's wife\n* Suresh Chandra Menon as DIG\n* Balaji Sakthivel as Siva\n\n# Production\n\n## Development\n\nThe film was first announced in November 2020, with Karthi and Raashii Khanna attached to star. P. S. Mithran was roped in to direct the film, which was produced by S. Lakshman Kumar under the banner of Prince Pictures.\n\n## Casting\n\nKarthi was the first actor to be cast in the film, playing the dual role of Inspector Vijay and Chandrasekhar.

These efforts can be implemented at various levels, from individual to global, and involve a range of strategies, including reducing energy consumption, increasing the use of renewable energy sources, and preserving and enhancing natural carbon sinks.\n\n# Definitions and scope\n\nClimate change mitigation is a critical component of addressing climate change, as it can help to reduce the severity of its impacts and avoid the most catastrophic consequences. Mitigation efforts can be categorized into two main types: reducing greenhouse gas emissions and removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.\n\n## Relationship with solar radiation modification (SRM)\n\nSolar radiation modification (SRM) is a proposed approach to mitigate climate change by reflecting a small percentage of the sun's radiation back into space. While SRM is not a substitute for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, it could potentially be used in conjunction with mitigation efforts to help achieve temperature targets.\n\n# Emission trends and pledges\n\nDespite growing awareness of the importance of addressing climate change, greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise. Current country pledges to reduce emissions are insufficient to limit warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.\n\n## Needed emissions cuts\n\nTo achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, global emissions must be reduced by 45% by 2030 compared to 2010 levels. This requires significant transformations in the way energy is produced, consumed, and distributed.\n\n## Pledges\n\nCountries have made varying levels of commitment to reducing emissions, with some pledging to achieve net-zero emissions by mid-century. However, current pledges are not sufficient to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, and more ambitious action is needed.\n\n# Low-carbon energy\n\nTransitioning to low-carbon energy sources is a critical component of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n## Solar and wind energy\n\nSolar and wind energy are two of the fastest-growing sources of new power generation capacity worldwide. These renewable energy sources offer significant potential for reducing emissions and improving energy security.\n\n## Other renewables\n\nOther renewable energy sources, such as hydroelectric power, geothermal energy, and biomass, also play important roles in reducing emissions.\n\n## Integrating variable renewable energy\n\nAs the share of variable renewable energy sources in the energy mix increases, grid operators and policymakers must work to ensure that the grid remains resilient and reliable.\n\n## Nuclear power\n\nNuclear power is a low-carbon energy source that can provide baseload power. However, its development is often hindered by high upfront costs and public concerns about safety and waste disposal.\n\n## Replacing coal with natural gas\n\nReplacing coal with natural gas can lead to significant emissions reductions in the short term. However, natural gas is not a long-term solution to climate change, and its development must be accompanied by measures to reduce methane leakage.\n\n# Demand reduction\n\nReducing energy demand is critical to achieving emissions reductions.\n\n## Energy conservation and efficiency\n\nImproving energy efficiency in buildings, industry, and transportation can lead to significant emissions reductions.\n\n## Lifestyle changes\n\nIndividuals can make lifestyle changes, such as reducing meat consumption, using public transportation, and increasing energy efficiency in their homes, to contribute to emissions reductions.\n\n## Dietary change\n\nAnimal agriculture is a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions. Reducing meat consumption, particularly beef, can lead to significant emissions reductions.\n\n## Family size\n\nFamily planning and education can help reduce population growth, which is a driver of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n# Preserving and enhancing carbon sinks\n\nPreserving and enhancing natural carbon sinks, such as forests, soils, and wetlands, is critical to removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.\n\n## Forests\n\n### Conservation\n\nConserving existing forests is critical to maintaining carbon sinks.\n\n### Afforestation and reforestation\n\nPlanting new trees can help restore degraded forests and expand carbon sinks.\n\n## Soils\n\nSoil conservation and restoration can help sequester carbon in soils.\n\n## Wetlands\n\nWetlands, such as mangroves and salt marshes, are important carbon sinks.\n\n## Deep ocean\n\nThe deep ocean is a significant carbon sink, and its preservation is critical to maintaining ocean health.\n\n## Enhanced weathering\n\nEnhanced weathering involves adding minerals to soils and oceans to enhance carbon sequestration.\n\n# Other methods to capture and store CO2\n\nOther methods, such as direct air capture and carbon capture and storage, can also be used to remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.\n\n# Mitigation by sector\n\nDifferent sectors, such as buildings, transportation, and industry, require unique approaches to mitigation.\n\n## Buildings\n\nImproving energy efficiency in buildings, through measures such as insulation and efficient appliances, can lead to significant emissions reductions.\n\n## Urban planning\n\nUrban planning can play a critical role in reducing emissions, through measures such as designing compact cities and promoting public transportation.\n\n## Transport\n\n### Shipping\n\nImproving fuel efficiency and transitioning to low-carbon fuels can reduce emissions from shipping.\n\n### Air transport\n\nImproving fuel efficiency and transitioning to low-carbon fuels

Grades are used to communicate the level of challenge and risk involved in a particular climb, allowing climbers to make informed decisions about which routes to attempt. There are various grading systems used in different types of climbing, including free climbing, bouldering, aid climbing, ice and mixed climbing, and mountaineering.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\nThe concept of grading climbs dates back to the early 20th century, when climbers in the Alps and other mountain ranges began to develop systems to describe the difficulty of routes. Over time, different grading systems evolved for different types of climbing, reflecting the unique characteristics and challenges of each discipline.\n\nFree Climbing\n-------------\n\nFree climbing involves ascending a rock face using only one's hands, feet, and other body parts, without the use of equipment such as ladders or ropes. Free climbing grades are used to measure the difficulty of a climb based on factors such as the steepness of the rock, the size and shape of the holds, and the exposure of the route.\n\n### French Numerical Grade\n\nThe French numerical grade system is one of the most widely used grading systems in free climbing. It consists of a series of numbers, ranging from 1 (easy) to 9 (extremely difficult). The system is further divided into sub-grades, with a plus sign (+) indicating a slightly more difficult climb and a minus sign (-) indicating a slightly easier climb.\n\n### American YDS Grade\n\nThe American YDS ( Yosemite Decimal System) grade system is commonly used in the United States and Canada. It consists of a series of numbers, ranging from Class 1 (easy walking) to Class 5 (technical climbing). Class 5 is further divided into sub-grades, ranging from 5.0 (easy) to 5.15 (extremely difficult).\n\n### UIAA Scale\n\nThe UIAA (Union of International Alpine Associations) scale is used in many European countries and is similar to the French numerical grade system. It consists of a series of numbers, ranging from I (easy) to XII (extremely difficult).\n\n### British E-Grade\n\nThe British E-grade system is used in the United Kingdom and is based on the concept of \"exposure,\" or the level of risk involved in a climb. E-grades range from E1 (easy) to E9 (extremely difficult).\n\n### Other Notable Systems\n\nOther notable free climbing grading systems include the Australian system, which uses a combination of numbers and letters to describe the difficulty of a climb, and the South African system, which uses a combination of numbers and grades to describe the difficulty of a climb.\n\nBouldering\n----------\n\nBouldering involves climbing short, lower-level rock formations without the use of ropes or harnesses. Bouldering grades are used to measure the difficulty of a climb based on factors such as the size and shape of the holds, the steepness of the rock, and the level of risk involved.\n\n### Comparison with Free Climbing\n\nBouldering grades are generally more difficult than free climbing grades, as bouldering involves climbing shorter distances without the use of protection. However, bouldering grades can be more subjective than free climbing grades, as the difficulty of a bouldering route can depend on the individual climber's technique and style.\n\n### Font Grade\n\nThe Font grade system is one of the most widely used grading systems in bouldering. It consists of a series of numbers, ranging from 1 (easy) to 8 (extremely difficult). The system is further divided into sub-grades, with a plus sign (+) indicating a slightly more difficult climb and a minus sign (-) indicating a slightly easier climb.\n\n### V-Grade\n\nThe V-grade system is commonly used in the United States and Canada. It consists of a series of numbers, ranging from V0 (easy) to V16 (extremely difficult).\n\n### Other Notable Systems\n\nOther notable bouldering grading systems include the British system, which uses a combination of numbers and grades to describe the difficulty of a climb, and the Australian system, which uses a combination of numbers and letters to describe the difficulty of a climb.\n\nAid Climbing\n------------\n\nAid climbing involves ascending a rock face using equipment such as ladders, ropes, and pitons. Aid climbing grades are used to measure the difficulty of a climb based on factors such as the steepness of the rock, the size and shape of the holds, and the level of risk involved.\n\n### Instability of Aid Grades\n\nAid climbing grades can be more subjective than free climbing grades, as the difficulty of an aid climb can depend on the individual climber's technique and style. Additionally, aid climbing grades can be more unstable than free climbing grades, as the use of equipment can affect the difficulty of a climb.\n\n### Original A-Grade\n\nThe original A-grade system was developed in the 1960s and consists of a series of numbers, ranging from A1 (easy) to A5 (extremely difficult).\n\n### New Wave A-Grade\n\nThe new wave A-grade system was developed in the 1980s and consists of a series of numbers, ranging from A0 (easy) to A5 (extremely difficult).\n\n### Clean C-Grade\n\nThe clean C-grade system is used in some parts of the world and consists of a series of numbers, ranging from C1 (easy) to C5 (extremely difficult).\n\nIce and Mixed Climbing\n---------------------\n\nIce and mixed climbing involve ascending ice formations and mixed rock and ice formations using equipment such as crampons and ice axes. Ice and mixed climbing grades are used to measure the difficulty of a climb based on factors such as the steepness of the ice, the quality of the ice, and the level of risk involved.\n\n### WI-Grade\n\nThe WI-grade system is commonly used in ice climbing and consists of a series of numbers, ranging from WI1 (easy) to WI7 (extremely difficult).\n\n### M-Grade\n\nThe M-grade system is commonly used in mixed climbing and consists of a series of numbers, ranging from M1 (easy) to M12 (extremely difficult).\n\n### D-Grade\n\nThe D-grade system is used in some parts of the world and consists of a series of numbers, ranging from D1 (easy) to D7 (extremely difficult).\n\n### Scottish Winter Grade\n\nThe Scottish winter grade system is used in Scotland and consists of a series of numbers, ranging from I (easy) to VII (extremely difficult).\n\n### Other Notable Systems\n\nOther notable ice and mixed climbing grading systems include the Canadian system, which uses a combination of numbers and grades to describe the difficulty of a climb, and the French system, which uses a combination of numbers and letters to describe the difficulty of a climb.\n\nMountaineering\n--------------\n\nMountaineering involves ascending a mountain using a variety of techniques, including hiking, climbing, and skiing. Mountaineering grades are used to measure the difficulty of a climb based on factors such as the steepness of the mountain, the quality of the rock, and the level of risk involved.\n\n### International French Adjectival System\n\nThe international French adjectival system is one of the most widely used grading systems in mountaineering. It consists of a series of adjectives, ranging from F (easy) to ED (extremely difficult).\n\n### American NCCS\n\nThe American NCCS ( National Climbing Classification System) is commonly used in the United States and Canada. It consists of a series of numbers, ranging from Class 1 (easy) to Class 5 (technical climbing).\n\n### Russian\n\nThe Russian system is used in Russia and consists of a series of numbers, ranging from 1A (easy) to 6B (extremely difficult).\n\n### Alaskan\n\nThe Alaskan system is used in Alaska and consists of a series of numbers, ranging from 1 (easy) to 5 (extremely difficult).\n\n### Other Notable Systems\n\nOther notable mountaineering grading systems include the British system, which uses a combination of numbers and grades to describe the difficulty of a climb, and the Australian system, which uses a combination of numbers and letters to describe the difficulty of a climb.\n\nComparison Tables\n-----------------\n\n### Comparison Free Climbing\n\n| Grade System | Easy | Medium | Hard | Extremely Hard |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| French | 1 | 5 | 7 | 9 |\n| American YDS | 5.0 | 5.7 | 5.10 | 5.15 |\n| UIAA | I | V | VII | IX |\n| British | E1 | E4 | E6 | E9 |\n\n### Comparison Bouldering\n\n| Grade System | Easy | Medium | Hard | Extremely Hard |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Font | 1 | 6 | 8 | 8+ |\n| V-Grade | V0 | V5 | V10 | V15 |\n| British | 4A | 6A | 7B | 8B |\n\n### Comparison Mountaineering\n\n| Grade System | Easy | Medium | Hard | Extremely Hard |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| International French Adjectival | F | PD | ED | ED+ |\n| American NCCS | Class 1 | Class 3 | Class 5 | Class 5.10 |\n| Russian | 1A | 3B | 5B | 6B |\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Climbing\n* Mountaineering\n* Rock climbing\n* Ice climbing\n* Bouldering\n* Aid climbing\n* Free climbing\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n* \"Climbing Grades\" by the International Climbing and Mountaneering Federation (UIAA)\n* \"The Climbing Encyclopedia\" by John Gill\n* \"Climbing Grades: A Guide to Understanding the Different Systems\" by Climbing Magazine\n\nFurther Reading\n----------------\n\n* \"The Complete Guide to Climbing Grades\" by Climbing Magazine\n* \"Climbing Grades: A Comprehensive Guide\" by Rock and Ice Magazine\n* \"Understanding Climbing Grades\" by the American Alpine Club\n\nExternal Links\n---------------\n\n* International Climbing and Mountaneering Federation (UIAA)\n* American Alpine Club\n* Climbing Magazine\n* Rock and Ice Magazine", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Grade_(climbing)\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n#Free climbing\n##French numerical grade\n##American YDS grade\n##UIAA scale\n##British E-grade\n##Other notable systems\n#Bouldering\n##Comparison with free climbing\n##Font grade\n##V-grade\n##Other notable systems\n#Aid climbing\n##Instability of aid grades\n##Original A-grade\n##New wave A-grade\n##Clean C-grade\n#Ice and mixed climbing\n##WI-grade\n##M-grade\n##D-grade\n##Scottish winter grade\n##Other notable systems\n#Mountaineering\n##International French Adjectival System\n##American NCCS\n##Russian\n##Alaskan\n##Other notable systems\n#Comparison tables\n##Comparison free climbing\n##Comparison bouldering\n##Comparison mountaineering\n#See also\n#References\n##Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

They are also known as hurricanes, typhoons, or cyclones, depending on the region. The year 2023 saw a significant number of tropical cyclones form around the world, bringing with them strong winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surges that caused widespread damage and disruption to communities.\n\n# Global atmospheric and hydrological conditions\n\nThe global atmospheric and hydrological conditions in 2023 were influenced by various climate patterns, including the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). These patterns played a significant role in shaping the tropical cyclone activity around the world.\n\nThe ENSO cycle, which affects the Pacific Ocean, was in a neutral phase during the first half of 2023, before transitioning to a weak El Niño event in the second half of the year. This led to an increase in tropical cyclone activity in the eastern Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe MJO, which affects the Indian and Pacific Oceans, was active throughout 2023, with several strong events occurring during the year. The MJO played a significant role in enhancing tropical cyclone activity in the western Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe IOD, which affects the Indian Ocean, was in a negative phase during the first half of 2023, before transitioning to a neutral phase in the second half of the year. This led to an increase in tropical cyclone activity in the north Indian Ocean.\n\n# Summary\n\nThe 2023 tropical cyclone season was marked by above-average activity in several basins around the world. The eastern Pacific Ocean saw a significant increase in activity, with several major hurricanes forming during the year. The western Pacific Ocean also saw above-average activity, with several typhoons forming during the year.\n\nThe north Indian Ocean saw a significant increase in activity, with several cyclones forming during the year. The south-west Indian Ocean saw below-average activity, with only a few tropical cyclones forming during the year.\n\nThe Australian region saw above-average activity, with several tropical cyclones forming during the year. The south Pacific Ocean saw below-average activity, with only a few tropical cyclones forming during the year.\n\n## North Atlantic Ocean\n\nThe 2023 North Atlantic hurricane season was marked by above-average activity, with 15 named storms forming during the year. The season started early, with the first named storm forming in May. The most intense storm of the season was Hurricane Idalia, which reached category 4 strength on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.\n\n## Eastern & Central Pacific Ocean\n\nThe 2023 eastern Pacific hurricane season was marked by above-average activity, with 20 named storms forming during the year. The season started early, with the first named storm forming in May.

The test aimed to validate the spacecraft's performance and capabilities in a high-altitude flight. This article provides an overview of the Starship spacecraft, its development, and the events leading up to the test launch, as well as a detailed account of the launch, its aftermath, and the subsequent investigations.\n\n# Background\n\n## Starship\n\nStarship is a reusable spacecraft developed by SpaceX, founded by Elon Musk. The spacecraft is designed to be capable of carrying both crew and cargo to the Moon, Mars, and other destinations in the solar system. Starship is a key component of SpaceX's ambitious plans for establishing a human settlement on Mars and making humanity a multi-planetary species. The spacecraft is approximately 120 meters (394 feet) tall and has a diameter of 9 meters (30 feet). It is powered by six Raptor engines, which are also developed by SpaceX.\n\n## Development\n\nThe development of Starship began in 2018, with the first prototype, SN1 (Serial Number 1), being built at SpaceX's facility in Boca Chica, Texas. The prototype was destroyed during a pressure test in February 2020. However, the development process continued, and subsequent prototypes, SN3, SN4, and SN5, were successfully tested. SN5 successfully completed a 150-meter (492-foot) hop test in August 2020, marking a significant milestone in the development of the spacecraft.\n\n## Opinions before launch\n\nBefore the launch, opinions about the success of the test were divided. Some experts expressed concerns about the spacecraft's stability and control during flight, while others were optimistic about its chances of success. Elon Musk himself stated that there was a \"genuine risk of real failure\" but emphasized the importance of taking risks to advance space technology.\n\n## Test objectives\n\nThe primary objective of the Starship Flight Test 1 was to test the spacecraft's performance in a high-altitude flight. The test aimed to validate the spacecraft's aerodynamics, guidance, navigation, and control systems, as well as its ability to survive the stresses of launch and re-entry.\n\n# Launch\n\n## Flight profile\n\nThe flight profile of the Starship Flight Test 1 consisted of a vertical takeoff, followed by a climb to an altitude of approximately 10 kilometers (33,000 feet). The spacecraft would then pitch over and glide back to Earth, ultimately landing vertically. The test was designed to simulate the conditions of a lunar or Mars landing.\n\n## Flight timeline\n\nThe flight timeline of the Starship Flight Test 1 was approximately 5 minutes and 30 seconds. The spacecraft would take off, climb to the desired altitude, and then glide back to Earth, landing vertically.\n\n## April 17, 2023, attempt\n\nThe first attempt to launch the Starship Flight Test 1 took place on April 17, 2023. However, the launch was scrubbed due to technical issues with the spacecraft's fuel system. The issue was reportedly caused by a faulty valve, which was replaced before the second attempt.\n\n## April 20, 2023, 2nd attempt\n\nThe second attempt to launch the Starship Flight Test 1 took place on April 20, 2023. The spacecraft lifted off at 9:00 AM CDT (14:00 UTC) and climbed to an altitude of approximately 10 kilometers (33,000 feet). However, the spacecraft experienced a loss of thrust and failed to pitch over, resulting in a crash landing. The spacecraft was destroyed in the crash.\n\n# Aftermath\n\n## Technical assessments\n\nFollowing the crash, SpaceX conducted a technical assessment of the flight data. The assessment revealed that the loss of thrust was caused by a faulty engine nozzle, which resulted in a loss of control. The issue was reportedly caused by a manufacturing defect, which was not detected during pre-flight testing.\n\n## Launch site\n\nThe launch site, Boca Chica, Texas, was inspected for damage following the crash. The site sustained minor damage, including a damaged launch pad and some debris scatter. The site was cleaned up, and repairs were made before future launches.\n\n## Effects on environment\n\nThe crash had a minimal impact on the environment. The spacecraft's fuel system was designed to be environmentally friendly, and the crash did not result in any significant environmental damage.\n\n## FAA investigation\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) conducted an investigation into the crash. The investigation revealed that the crash was caused by a combination of technical and manufacturing issues. The FAA issued a report outlining the findings of the investigation and recommending steps to prevent similar incidents in the future.\n\n# See also\n\n* SpaceX\n* Starship\n* Reusable launch systems\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a factual account of the Starship Flight Test 1.

The election was the first to be held since the 2019-2021 protests, which led to the resignation of the government, and the COVID-19 pandemic, which had a significant impact on the country's economy and healthcare system. The election was also held in the aftermath of the Beirut explosion, which devastated the capital city and exacerbated the country's economic and humanitarian crisis.\n\n# Background\n\n## 2019–21 protests\nThe 2019-2021 protests in Lebanon began on October 17, 2019, in response to a proposed tax on WhatsApp and other messaging apps. The protests quickly escalated into a national movement, with demonstrators calling for the resignation of the government, the end of corruption, and the establishment of a new economic system. The protests led to the resignation of Prime Minister Saad Hariri on October 29, 2019, and the formation of a new government led by Hassan Diab. However, the protests continued, and the government was eventually forced to resign in August 2020.\n\n## Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on Lebanon, with the country's healthcare system struggling to cope with the influx of cases. The pandemic also had a devastating impact on the country's economy, with many businesses forced to close and thousands of people losing their jobs. The pandemic also exacerbated the country's existing economic crisis, with the Lebanese pound plummeting in value against the US dollar.\n\n## Beirut explosion\nOn August 4, 2020, a massive explosion occurred at the Port of Beirut, killing over 200 people and injuring thousands more. The explosion was caused by the ignition of a shipment of ammonium nitrate that had been stored at the port for years.

However, the polls also suggested that there would be a significant increase in support for independent candidates and smaller parties.\n\n# Political parties and coalitions\n\n## Future Movement\nThe Future Movement is a Sunni Muslim party led by Prime Minister Saad Hariri.

The dynasty's rulers, including Gruffydd ap Cynan and Owain Gwynedd, led a series of rebellions against the Normans, who were attempting to conquer Wales.

The llys was also a symbol of the ruler's wealth and status, and it was decorated with luxurious furnishings and ornate architecture.\n\n#Princes of Wales (de facto)\n\nThe rulers of the House of Aberffraw were often referred to as the Princes of Wales, although this title was not officially recognized by the English crown. The Princes of Wales were de facto rulers of the country, and they played a significant role in shaping the course of Welsh history.\n\n##Llywelyn the Great\n\nLlywelyn the Great was one of the most notable rulers of the House of Aberffraw, who united the kingdoms of Gwynedd and Wales under his rule. Llywelyn was a powerful and influential leader, who played a significant role in shaping the course of Welsh history. He was also a skilled military leader, who led a series of successful campaigns against the English crown.\n\n##1200s- 1400s\n\nDuring the 13th and 14th centuries, the House of Aberffraw continued to play a significant role in the politics and society of Wales.

The controversy led to widespread criticism, public outcry, and ultimately, the resignation of Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\n\n# Background\n\n## COVID-19 lockdowns in the United Kingdom\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic led to a series of lockdowns and restrictions in the United Kingdom, with the first national lockdown beginning on 23 March 2020. The lockdowns were implemented to reduce the spread of the virus, and the government introduced various rules and regulations to enforce this, including restrictions on gatherings and travel.\n\n## Westminster\n\nThe UK government, led by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, was responsible for implementing and enforcing the lockdown rules. 10 Downing Street, the official residence and office of the Prime Minister, was also subject to these rules. However, allegations emerged that the government had breached these rules on multiple occasions, leading to widespread criticism and public outcry.\n\n# Timeline of reporting and reaction\n\n## 2021\n\n### Up to 6 December\n\nIn November 2021, reports emerged of a Christmas party held at 10 Downing Street in December 2020, during the second national lockdown.

The video, which featured the Prime Minister's then-spokesperson Allegra Stratton, was leaked to the media and sparked widespread outrage.\n\n### 9 December onwards\n\nFollowing the emergence of the Stratton video, the Prime Minister faced intense pressure to explain the events surrounding the Christmas party.

The reports alleged that the Prime Minister had attended the party, which was said to have been attended by dozens of staff members.\n\n### From 24 January\n\nOn 24 January 2022, the Prime Minister's former advisor Dominic Cummings published a blog post in which he alleged that the Prime Minister had been aware of the parties and had lied about them. The post sparked a fresh wave of criticism and calls for the Prime Minister's resignation.\n\n### After the conclusion of the police investigation\n\nIn May 2022, the Metropolitan Police concluded their investigation into the parties and gatherings at 10 Downing Street, issuing 126 fixed penalty notices to 83 individuals, including the Prime Minister.\n\n### After the publication of Gray's report\n\nIn May 2022, the Sue Gray report was published, detailing the findings of an investigation into the parties and gatherings at 10 Downing Street. The report was highly critical of the government's handling of the pandemic and the culture within 10 Downing Street.\n\n## 2023\n\n### COVID-19 Inquiry evidence\n\nIn June 2023, the Prime Minister gave evidence to the COVID-19 Inquiry, a public inquiry into the government's handling of the pandemic. During his evidence, the Prime Minister faced questions about the parties and gatherings at 10 Downing Street.\n\n### June–October 2023\n\nIn the months following the Prime Minister's evidence to the COVID-19 Inquiry, further revelations emerged about the parties and gatherings at 10 Downing Street, including allegations of a culture of bullying and harassment within the government.\n\n# Events\n\n## During first national lockdown\n\nIn May 2020, a party was held in the garden of 10 Downing Street, during the first national lockdown. The party was said to have been attended by dozens of staff members, including the Prime Minister.\n\n## Mid-2020\n\nIn June 2020, a gathering was held in the Cabinet Room at 10 Downing Street, during which wine and food were consumed.

The film stars Daniel Kaluuya, Keke Palmer, and Brandon Perea, and follows the story of two siblings who discover a mysterious and terrifying entity on their family's ranch.\n\n#Plot\n\nThe film takes place on a remote ranch in California, where Otis \"OJ\" Haywood Jr. (Daniel Kaluuya) and his sister Emerald (Keke Palmer) live and work. The siblings have a strained relationship, but they are forced to work together to manage the ranch after their father's mysterious death. One day, they discover a strange and unexplained phenomenon on the ranch - a mysterious entity that appears to be a large, cloud-like creature that seems to be watching them.\n\nAs the siblings try to uncover the truth about the entity, they are joined by Angel Torres (Brandon Perea), a tech-obsessed employee who becomes embroiled in their quest for answers. As the entity's presence becomes more menacing, the trio discovers that it is not just a simple creature, but a malevolent being that is capable of manipulating the environment and the people around it.\n\nAs the stakes grow higher, OJ, Emerald, and Angel must work together to survive the entity's attacks and uncover its true nature.

The film's use of a mysterious and unexplained entity as a central plot device allows Peele to explore these themes in a way that is both subtle and thought-provoking.\n\nOne of the key themes of the film is the power of spectacle and the way that it can both captivate and control people. The entity at the center of the film is a masterful creation that is capable of manipulating the environment and the people around it, and it serves as a metaphor for the ways in which spectacle can be used to control and manipulate people.\n\nThe film also explores the dangers of obsession and the ways in which it can consume people. The character of Ricky \"Jupe\" Park, played by Steven Yeun, is a former child star who has become obsessed with the entity and is determined to capture it on film. His obsession ultimately leads to tragic consequences, and serves as a warning about the dangers of becoming too fixated on a particular goal or idea.\n\nFinally, the film explores the impact of trauma on individuals and communities. The entity at the center of the film is connected to a series of traumatic events in the past, and the characters are forced to confront their own trauma and emotional scars in order to survive. The film is a powerful exploration of the ways in which trauma can shape and define people, and serves as a reminder of the importance of confronting and processing difficult emotions.\n\n#Production\n\n##Development\n\nNope was first announced in June 2020, when it was reported that Jordan Peele would be writing and directing a new horror film for Universal Pictures. The film was initially titled \"Untitled Jordan Peele Project,\" but was later given the title \"Nope\" in July 2021.\n\n##Filming\n\nPrincipal photography on Nope began in June 2021, and took place on location in California. The film was shot on a combination of digital and film cameras, and used a range of innovative techniques to capture the entity and its movements.\n\n##Creature design\n\nThe creature at the center of Nope was designed by a team of artists and designers, led by Peele and his production designer, Ruth De Jong. The creature is a complex and innovative creation that uses a combination of practical and digital effects to bring it to life.\n\n##Costumes\n\nThe costumes in Nope were designed by Ruth E. Carter, who has previously worked on films such as \"Black Panther\" and \"Selma.\" The costumes are a key part of the film's visual identity, and help to establish the characters and their relationships with each other.\n\n##Sound design\n\nThe sound design in Nope was created by a team of sound designers and mixers, led by Johnnie Burn. The sound design is a key part of the film's overall atmosphere and tension, and helps to bring the entity to life.\n\n##Music\n\nThe music in Nope was composed by Michael Abels, who has previously worked on films such as \"Get Out\" and \"Us.\" The score is a combination of electronic and orchestral elements, and helps to establish the film's mood and atmosphere.\n\n#Marketing\n\nNope was marketed and promoted by Universal Pictures, which released a series of trailers and promotional materials in the months leading up to the film's release. The film's marketing campaign was notable for its use of social media and online platforms, which helped to build a sense of excitement and anticipation around the film.\n\n#Release\n\nNope was released in theaters on July 22, 2022, and was available to stream on Peacock 45 days later. The film was a commercial success, grossing over $250 million worldwide and becoming one of the highest-grossing films of the year.\n\n#Reception\n\n##Box office\n\nNope was a commercial success, grossing over $250 million worldwide. The film opened at number one at the US box office, and stayed in the top ten for several weeks.\n\n##Critical response\n\nNope received widespread critical acclaim, with many praising the film's originality, atmosphere, and performances. The film holds a 92% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on over 200 reviews.\n\n##Accolades\n\nNope was recognized with several awards and nominations, including a nomination for Best Original Screenplay at the Academy Awards.\n\n#Possible sequels\n\nThere has been speculation about the possibility of a sequel to Nope, although nothing has been officially announced. Peele has stated that he is open to the idea of a sequel, but only if he can come up with a story that is worthy of the original film.\n\n#Notes\n\nNope is a film that is full of subtle references and allusions to other films and cultural touchstones. The film's use of a mysterious and unexplained entity as a central plot device is reminiscent of classic science fiction and horror films, such as \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" and \"The Shining.\"\n\n#References\n\nThis article does not include any references or citations.\n\n#External links\n\n* Official website\n* Nope on IMDb\n* Nope at Rotten Tomatoes\n* Nope at Metacritic", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Nope_(film)\" following this outline:\n\n#Plot\n#Cast\n#Themes and interpretations\n#Production\n##Development\n##Filming\n##Creature design\n##Costumes\n##Sound design\n##Music\n#Marketing\n#Release\n#Reception\n##Box office\n##Critical response\n##Accolades\n#Possible sequels\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Malone's work on Jefferson is considered one of the most authoritative and influential studies of the third President of the United States. Throughout his career, Malone demonstrated a deep commitment to historical scholarship, and his contributions to the field of American history have had a lasting impact.\n\n# Early life and education\n\n## Upbringing\n\nDumas Malone was born on January 10, 1892, in Coldwater, Mississippi, to a family of modest means. His parents, both of whom were schoolteachers, instilled in him a love of learning and a strong work ethic. Malone's early life was marked by a strong sense of curiosity and a desire to explore the world beyond his small town. He spent much of his childhood reading and exploring the outdoors, developing a deep appreciation for history and the natural world.\n\n## Ministry and Yale\n\nMalone's interest in history and literature led him to pursue a career in the ministry. He attended Emory College in Oxford, Georgia, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1910. Malone then went on to study at Yale University, where he earned a Bachelor of Divinity degree in 1916. During his time at Yale, Malone developed a passion for historical research and writing, skills that would serve him well in his future career.\n\n# Career\n\n## Virginia and the DAB\n\nAfter completing his studies, Malone moved to Virginia, where he began working on the Dictionary of American Biography (DAB). The DAB, a comprehensive reference work that aimed to document the lives of notable Americans, was a major undertaking that required meticulous research and writing. Malone's work on the DAB helped him develop his skills as a biographer and historian, and he quickly became known for his attention to detail and his ability to craft compelling narratives.\n\n## Harvard University Press\n\nIn 1923, Malone joined Harvard University Press as an editor. During his time at Harvard, Malone worked on a number of projects, including the publication of several notable historical works. His experience at Harvard helped him develop a keen eye for detail and a deep understanding of the publishing process.\n\n## Return to Virginia\n\nIn 1951, Malone returned to Virginia, where he took up a position as a research professor at the University of Virginia. Malone spent the remainder of his career at Virginia, where he continued to work on his biography of Thomas Jefferson. Malone's work on Jefferson was a labor of love, and he spent decades researching and writing the six-volume biography that would become his masterpiece.\n\n# Legacy and honors\n\nMalone's contributions to American history have been widely recognized. He was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for History in 1975 for the fifth volume of his Jefferson biography. Malone also received the Thomas Jefferson Foundation Medal in 1976, and he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1977. Malone's work on Jefferson has been widely praised for its thoroughness and its insight into the life and times of one of America's most important historical figures.\n\n# Personal life and death\n\nMalone married Elizabeth Green in 1921, and the couple had two daughters together. Malone was known for his kind and generous spirit, and he was beloved by his colleagues and students. Malone died on December 27, 1986, at the age of 94, leaving behind a legacy as one of America's most important historians.\n\n# Selected publications\n\n## Jefferson and His Time\n\nMalone's six-volume biography of Thomas Jefferson, \"Jefferson and His Time\", is his masterpiece. The work, which took decades to complete, is a comprehensive and deeply nuanced study of Jefferson's life and times.

The floods were caused by heavy rainfall and resulted in significant damage to infrastructure, homes, and agricultural land. The disaster also had a major impact on the region's economy, particularly in the tourism and sports sectors.\n\n# History\n\nThe Emilia-Romagna region has a history of flooding, particularly in the Po River valley. The region's geography, with its flat plains and numerous waterways, makes it prone to flooding. In recent years, the region has experienced several significant flooding events, including the 2014 floods that caused widespread damage and displacement.\n\nIn the lead-up to the 2023 floods, the region experienced a prolonged period of heavy rainfall, which saturated the soil and filled waterways to capacity. On May 10, 2023, a severe storm system moved into the region, bringing with it intense rainfall and strong winds. The storm caused rivers to burst their banks, resulting in widespread flooding across the region.\n\n# Effects\n\nThe 2023 Emilia-Romagna floods had a significant impact on the region, causing widespread damage and disruption.\n\n## Emilia Romagna Grand Prix\n\nThe floods had a major impact on the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix, a Formula One racing event held at the Imola Circuit in the region. The event, which was scheduled to take place on May 14, 2023, was postponed due to the flooding. The circuit, which is located in a low-lying area, was severely affected by the floods, with water covering large sections of the track.\n\nThe postponement of the Grand Prix had significant economic implications for the region, with many hotels and restaurants reporting cancellations and losses. The event was eventually rescheduled for June 2023, but the damage had already been done, with many tourists and spectators forced to cancel their plans.\n\n## Bruce Springsteen concert controversy\n\nThe floods also caused controversy surrounding a concert by American musician Bruce Springsteen, which was scheduled to take place in the city of Parma on May 12, 2023. Despite the flooding, Springsteen's management team announced that the concert would go ahead as scheduled, sparking outrage among local residents who felt that the event would put a strain on already stretched emergency services.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the concert highlighted the difficulties faced by event organizers and authorities in responding to the floods. While some events, such as the Grand Prix, were postponed or cancelled, others, such as the Springsteen concert, were allowed to proceed, causing frustration and confusion among the public.\n\n# Reactions\n\nThe response to the 2023 Emilia-Romagna floods was led by the Italian government, which declared a state of emergency in the region. The government deployed military personnel and equipment to assist with relief efforts, and provided financial aid to affected residents and businesses.\n\nThe floods also sparked a strong response from the international community, with many countries offering aid and assistance to the affected region. The European Union, in particular, played a key role in coordinating relief efforts and providing financial support to the region.\n\n# Humanitarian efforts\n\nThe humanitarian response to the 2023 Emilia-Romagna floods was led by a range of organizations, including the Italian Red Cross, the European Commission's Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection department (ECHO), and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).\n\nThese organizations worked together to provide emergency assistance to affected residents, including food, shelter, and medical care. They also worked to support the recovery efforts, providing aid to farmers and businesses affected by the floods.\n\n# See also\n\n* 2014 Emilia-Romagna floods\n* 2021 European floods\n* List of floods in Italy\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a general overview of the 2023 Emilia-Romagna floods.

The family's influence and reputation have been built on their entrepreneurial spirit, innovative ideas, and strategic business ventures. Over the years, the Engwalls have made significant contributions to various industries, including media, pharmaceuticals, and manufacturing, leaving a lasting impact on Swedish society and beyond.\n\nEarly History\n\nThe Engwall family's early history is shrouded in mystery, with little information available on their ancestors before the mid-19th century. However, it is known that the family originated from the province of Västmanland in central Sweden. During this period, the Engwalls were primarily engaged in agriculture and small-scale trading. The family's fortunes began to change with the emergence of the third generation, which would go on to shape the Engwall legacy.\n\nThird Generation (Late 19th–Mid 20th Century)\n\nThe third generation of Engwalls marked a significant turning point in the family's history, as they began to aggressively expand their business interests and establish themselves as prominent figures in Swedish society.\n\nEpoch of Sven Victor Engwall\n\nSven Victor Engwall, born in 1853, was a visionary entrepreneur who played a pivotal role in the family's rise to prominence.

They established partnerships and joint ventures with various European companies, further solidifying their position as major players in the global business arena.\n\nThe Kreuger Epoch\n\nThe Engwalls' fortunes were further boosted by their association with the infamous Swedish businessman Ivar Kreuger.

The Engwalls' partnership with Kreuger helped them expand their business interests and established them as major players in the global match industry.\n\nPharmaceutical Industry\n\nThe Engwalls also made significant inroads into the pharmaceutical industry, investing in various research and development ventures. Their commitment to innovation and quality helped establish the family as major players in the Swedish pharmaceutical sector.\n\nFourth Generation (Early–Mid 20th Century)\n\nThe fourth generation of Engwalls saw the emergence of Jacob Engwall, a prominent businessman and entrepreneur who would go on to shape the family's future.\n\nJacob Engwall\n\nJacob Engwall, born in 1884, was a shrewd businessman who played a significant role in the family's continued success.

The game was released on November 8, 2022, for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S. It is the latest installment in the Sonic the Hedgehog series and marks a significant departure from the traditional Sonic formula.\n\n#Gameplay\n\nSonic Frontiers features an open-world design, allowing players to explore a vast, interconnected environment. The game takes place on the Starfall Islands, a group of islands filled with ancient ruins, lush forests, and snowy mountains. Players control Sonic, who must navigate through the islands, completing quests, collecting rings, and defeating enemies.\n\nThe gameplay revolves around Sonic's speed and agility, with a focus on exploration and discovery. Players can run, jump, and spin dash through the environment, using Sonic's abilities to traverse the terrain and avoid obstacles. The game also features a new mechanic called the \"Cyloop,\" which allows Sonic to create a loop of energy that can be used to solve puzzles and defeat enemies.\n\nIn addition to exploration, Sonic Frontiers features a variety of combat encounters against robotic enemies. Players can use Sonic's speed and agility to dodge attacks and strike back with powerful combos. The game also features a variety of boss battles against giant robots and other formidable foes.\n\n#Plot\n\nThe game's story follows Sonic, who is transported to the Starfall Islands after a mysterious event. Upon arrival, Sonic discovers that the islands are inhabited by a group of ancient robots, known as the \"Gardiens,\" who possess the power to control the environment. The Gardiens are being hunted by a group of rogue robots, known as the \"Titans,\" who seek to destroy the islands and everyone on them.\n\nSonic soon discovers that he is not alone on the islands. He meets a group of allies, including a mysterious girl named Sage, who possesses the ability to communicate with the Gardiens. Together, Sonic and Sage embark on a quest to stop the Titans and save the Starfall Islands.\n\n##Another Story\n\nAs players progress through the game, they will encounter a series of side quests and storylines that reveal more about the history of the Starfall Islands and the Gardiens. These side quests, known as \"Memory Shards,\" allow players to experience the game's story from different perspectives, including that of Sage and the Gardiens.\n\nThe Memory Shards provide insight into the world's lore and the events that led up to Sonic's arrival on the Starfall Islands.

The game's characters are well-written and relatable, with complex motivations and backstories.\n\n##Music\n\nThe game's music was composed by Tomoya Ohtani, a veteran video game composer who has worked on numerous Sonic games. Ohtani's score is notable for its catchy melodies and driving rhythms, which perfectly capture the game's sense of speed and energy.\n\nThe game's soundtrack features a mix of electronic and rock music, with a focus on high-energy beats and soaring melodies. The music is perfectly integrated into the game, with each track perfectly capturing the mood and atmosphere of the game's various environments.\n\n#Marketing and release\n\nSonic Frontiers was officially announced in December 2020, with a teaser trailer that showcased the game's open-world design and fast-paced action.

This movement emerged in the early 20th century as a response to the perceived drift of mainline Protestant denominations towards liberal theology and the abandonment of traditional Christian doctrine.\n\n**History and Main Leaders**\n\nReformed fundamentalism has its roots in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when conservative evangelicals began to react against the rising tide of liberal theology and modernism in mainline Protestant denominations. Key figures such as Charles Spurgeon, D. Martyn Lloyd-Jones, and J. Gresham Machen played significant roles in shaping the movement. Machen, in particular, is often credited with articulating the fundamentalist position in his 1923 book \"Christianity and Liberalism.\" Other influential leaders include Carl McIntire, founder of the Bible Presbyterian Church, and Gordon Clark, a philosopher and theologian who wrote extensively on the relationship between Christianity and philosophy.\n\n**Theological Distinctives**\n\nReformed fundamentalism is characterized by several key theological distinctives that set it apart from other forms of evangelicalism.\n\n### Broader Conservative Evangelicalism\n\nReformed fundamentalism shares many of the same concerns and convictions as broader conservative evangelicalism, including a commitment to the authority and inerrancy of Scripture, the importance of personal conversion and evangelism, and a strong emphasis on biblical morality.\n\n### Pertaining to Salvation and the Gospel\n\nReformed fundamentalists emphasize the importance of the Reformed doctrine of salvation, which stresses the sovereignty of God in salvation and the necessity of faith in Jesus Christ for eternal life. They also emphasize the importance of the gospel message, which they believe is being undermined by liberal theology and modernism.\n\n### Other Fundamental Protestant and Biblical Theology\n\nReformed fundamentalists also affirm many of the classic Protestant and biblical doctrines, including the Trinity, the deity of Christ, and the importance of the sacraments. They also emphasize the importance of biblical theology, which they believe is essential for understanding the Bible and its message.\n\n### The Inspiration and Preservation of the Scriptures\n\nReformed fundamentalists believe in the verbal plenary inspiration of Scripture, which holds that the Bible is the inspired Word of God and is therefore inerrant and authoritative in all matters of faith and practice.\n\n#### Verbal Plenary Inspiration\n\nVerbal plenary inspiration is the doctrine that the Bible is the inspired Word of God, and that every word and phrase is divinely inspired and authoritative. Reformed fundamentalists believe that this doctrine is essential for maintaining the authority and inerrancy of Scripture.\n\n#### Preservation of the Texts of Scripture\n\nReformed fundamentalists also believe in the preservation of the texts of Scripture, which holds that God has providentially preserved the Bible from error and corruption throughout history. They believe that this doctrine is essential for maintaining the trustworthiness and reliability of Scripture.\n\n**Common Principles of Reformation Evangelical Interpretation and Private Reading**\n\nReformed fundamentalists believe in certain common principles of Reformation evangelical interpretation and private reading, including the importance of literal interpretation, the use of grammatical-historical method, and the necessity of careful exegesis.\n\n**The Classical Creeds and Reformational Confessions**\n\nReformed fundamentalists affirm the classical creeds and reformational confessions, including the Apostles' Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Westminster Confession of Faith. They believe that these documents provide a summary of the essential doctrines of Christianity and serve as a basis for unity and cooperation among believers.\n\n**Congregational Practices**\n\nReformed fundamentalists emphasize the importance of congregational practices, including the observance of the Lord's Supper, baptism, and the public reading of Scripture. They also emphasize the importance of corporate worship and the gathering of believers for mutual edification and encouragement.\n\n**Bible Translation and Usage**\n\nReformed fundamentalists have a high view of the importance of Bible translation and usage, believing that the Bible should be translated into the vernacular languages of the people and that believers should be encouraged to read and study the Bible for themselves.\n\n### The Authorised Version Tradition, the Byzantine Received Text, and Eastern (Greek) and Western (Greco-Latin) Ecclesiastical Translation Traditions\n\nReformed fundamentalists have historically been associated with the Authorized Version (KJV) tradition, which emphasizes the importance of the Byzantine Received Text and the Eastern (Greek) and Western (Greco-Latin) ecclesiastical translation traditions. They believe that these traditions provide a faithful representation of the original text of Scripture.\n\n### Modern Versions, Denominational Preferences and Translation Controversies\n\nReformed fundamentalists have also been involved in controversies surrounding modern Bible translations, including debates over the use of dynamic equivalence and the importance of formal equivalence. They believe that the choice of Bible translation is a matter of great importance and that believers should be careful to choose a translation that is faithful to the original text of Scripture.\n\n**Evangelical and Missional Apologetics**\n\nReformed fundamentalists emphasize the importance of evangelical and missional apologetics, believing that believers should be prepared to give a reason for the hope that is within them and to defend the faith against attacks from unbelievers.\n\n### Bible Apologetics\n\nReformed fundamentalists believe in the importance of Bible apologetics, which involves defending the authority and inerrancy of Scripture against attacks from unbelievers. They believe that this is essential for maintaining the trustworthiness and reliability of Scripture.\n\n**Liberal-Modernist Challenge to Verbal Inspiration and Truthfulness of Scripture**\n\nReformed fundamentalists have historically been opposed to liberal-modernist challenges to verbal inspiration and the truthfulness of Scripture, believing that these challenges undermine the authority and trustworthiness of Scripture.\n\n**Modern Biblical Criticism**\n\nReformed fundamentalists have also been critical of modern biblical criticism, which they believe has led to a decline in the authority and trustworthiness of Scripture. They believe that this criticism has been driven by a rationalistic and naturalistic worldview that is hostile to the supernatural and the miraculous.\n\n**Modern Western Society and Intellectual Unbelief**\n\nReformed fundamentalists believe that modern Western society is characterized by intellectual unbelief and a decline in the authority and trustworthiness of Scripture. They believe that this is due to a variety of factors, including the rise of modernism and the decline of traditional Christian values.\n\n### Criticism of New-Neo Evangelicalism and the 'Present Downgrade'\n\nReformed fundamentalists have been critical of new-neo evangelicalism and the \"present downgrade,\" which they believe has led to a decline in the authority and trustworthiness of Scripture. They believe that this is due to a variety of factors, including the rise of modernism and the decline of traditional Christian values.\n\n### Materialist and Naturalist Unbelief, and Historic Adamism and Creationism\n\nReformed fundamentalists believe that materialist and naturalist unbelief is a major challenge to the authority and trustworthiness of Scripture, particularly in the areas of historic Adamism and creationism. They believe that these doctrines are essential for maintaining the trustworthiness and reliability of Scripture.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Fundamentalism\n* Evangelicalism\n* Reformed theology\n* Biblical inerrancy\n* Verbal plenary inspiration\n* Preservation of Scripture\n\n**Resources**\n\n* J.

His works spanned multiple genres, including science fiction, fantasy, and romance, and he is considered one of the pioneers of the science fiction genre. Griffith's writing career was marked by periods of significant productivity and innovation, as well as personal struggles and decline. This article provides an overview of Griffith's life, writing career, and legacy, highlighting his contributions to science fiction and his place in literary history.\n\n# Biography\n\n## Early life\n\nGeorge Griffith was born on June 24, 1857, in Plymouth, Devon, England. His father was a sea captain, and Griffith's early life was marked by frequent moves and a sense of adventure. He was educated at a local grammar school and later attended a teacher training college in London. Griffith's love of literature and writing began at an early age, and he was particularly drawn to the works of Jules Verne and H.G. Wells.\n\n## Teaching career\n\nBefore becoming a full-time writer, Griffith worked as a teacher in London. He taught at several schools, including a technical school in the East End, where he developed an interest in science and technology. Griffith's teaching experience had a lasting impact on his writing, as he often incorporated scientific and technological themes into his stories.\n\n## Writing career\n\n### Early career\n\nGriffith began his writing career in the late 1880s, contributing short stories and articles to various magazines and journals. His early work was largely influenced by the science fiction of Jules Verne and the adventure stories of Rider Haggard. Griffith's first novel, \"The Angel of the Revolution,\" was published in 1893 and received moderate success.\n\n### Breakthrough\n\nGriffith's breakthrough novel, \"Olga Romanoff,\" was published in 1894. The book was a commercial success and established Griffith as a prominent figure in the science fiction genre. \"Olga Romanoff\" was a futuristic romance that explored themes of love, power, and social change. The novel's success can be attributed to Griffith's innovative use of scientific and technological concepts, as well as his engaging storytelling style.\n\n### Mid-1890s\n\nThe mid-1890s were a period of significant productivity for Griffith. He published several novels and short story collections, including \"Valdar the Oft-Born\" (1895) and \"The Outlaws of the Air\" (1895). Griffith's work during this period was characterized by its sense of adventure, scientific speculation, and social commentary.\n\n### Decline\n\nGriffith's writing career began to decline in the late 1890s. He struggled with personal problems, including poverty and illness, which affected his productivity and the quality of his work. Griffith's later novels, such as \"The Lake of Gold\" (1898) and \"A Criminal Croesus\" (1899), received mixed reviews and failed to achieve the same level of success as his earlier works.\n\n### Final years\n\nIn his final years, Griffith continued to write, although at a slower pace. He published several short story collections and novels, including \"The World Peril of 1910\" (1907) and \"The Lord of Labour\" (1911). Griffith's later work was marked by a sense of nostalgia and a renewed interest in social and political issues.\n\n## Death\n\nGeorge Griffith died on June 24, 1906, at the age of 49. He was buried in a London cemetery, and his funeral was attended by several prominent figures in the literary world.\n\n# Legacy\n\n## Place in science fiction history\n\nGeorge Griffith is considered one of the pioneers of the science fiction genre. His innovative use of scientific and technological concepts, as well as his engaging storytelling style, helped to establish science fiction as a major literary genre. Griffith's work influenced a generation of science fiction writers, including H.G. Wells and Jules Verne.\n\n## Literary proficiency\n\nGriffith's writing style was characterized by its sense of adventure, scientific speculation, and social commentary. He was a master of the serialized novel, and his works were often published in serial form before being collected into book form. Griffith's use of language was engaging and accessible, making his works appealing to a wide range of readers.\n\n## In relation to H. G. Wells\n\nGriffith's relationship with H.G. Wells was complex and multifaceted. The two writers were friends and correspondents, and they shared a mutual interest in science fiction and social commentary. However, Griffith's work was often overshadowed by Wells' more famous novels, such as \"The Time Machine\" and \"The War of the Worlds.\" Despite this, Griffith's influence on Wells' work is evident, particularly in Wells' use of scientific and technological concepts.\n\n# Personal views\n\n## Religion\n\nGriffith was a spiritual person, and his work often explored themes of spirituality and mysticism. He was interested in theosophy and the occult, and he incorporated elements of these belief systems into his stories.\n\n## Politics\n\nGriffith was a socialist, and his work often reflected his left-wing views. He was interested in social justice and equality, and he explored these themes in many of his stories.\n\n## Social matters\n\nGriffith was a strong advocate for women's rights and social reform. He believed in the importance of education and social mobility, and he often explored these themes in his work.\n\n# Publications\n\n## Poetry collections\n\n* \"Poems\" (1886)\n\n## Novels\n\n* \"The Angel of the Revolution\" (1893)\n* \"Olga Romanoff\" (1894)\n* \"Valdar the Oft-Born\" (1895)\n* \"The Outlaws of the Air\" (1895)\n* \"The Lake of Gold\" (1898)\n* \"A Criminal Croesus\" (1899)\n* \"The World Peril of 1910\" (1907)\n* \"The Lord of Labour\" (1911)\n\n## Short stories\n\n* \"The Raid of Le Vengeur\" (1891)\n* \"The Doom of the Great City\" (1894)\n* \"The Black Magician\" (1895)\n* \"The Star-Worshipper\" (1896)\n\n## Short story collections\n\n* \"The Outlaws of the Air\" (1895)\n* \"The World Peril of 1910\" (1907)\n* \"The Lord of Labour\" (1911)\n\n## Non-fiction books\n\n* \"A Honeymoon in Space\" (1901)\n\n# Explanatory notes\n\nThis article is a comprehensive overview of George Griffith's life and work.

It is bordered by eight countries: Greece and Bulgaria to the northwest; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Iran to the east; Iraq to the southeast; and Syria to the south. The country has a diverse geography, with mountains, forests, and coastlines along the Mediterranean, Aegean, and Black Seas. With a rich history dating back to ancient times, Turkey has been a crossroads of cultures, empires, and civilizations.\n\nEtymology\n---------\n\nThe English name \"Turkey\" is derived from the Middle English word \"Turke,\" which referred to the Turkish people. The name \"Türkiye\" is derived from the Turkish word \"Türk,\" which means \"strong\" or \"brave.\" The country's official name, \"Republic of Türkiye,\" was adopted in 1923 after the establishment of the modern Turkish state.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### Prehistory and ancient history\n\nHuman habitation in Turkey dates back to the Paleolithic era, with archaeological evidence showing that the region was inhabited by various cultures, including the Hittites, Lydians, and Phrygians. The ancient city of Troy, famous for the Trojan War, is located in northwest Turkey. The Hittite Empire, which flourished from the 17th to the 12th centuries BCE, was a major power in the ancient Near East.\n\n### Early classical antiquity\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Hittite Empire, the region was conquered by the Lydians, who established their capital in Sardis. The Lydians were known for their advanced culture, including their use of coins and their love of luxury. In the 6th century BCE, the Persian Empire conquered Lydia, and the region became a satrapy (province) of the empire.\n\n### Rome and Byzantine Empire\n\nIn the 1st century BCE, the Roman Empire conquered the region, and it became a major center of early Christianity. The city of Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul) was founded by the Roman Emperor Constantine in 330 CE and became the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire, also known as the Byzantine Empire. The Byzantine Empire played a significant role in the development of Christianity and the preservation of classical Greek and Roman culture.\n\n### Seljuks and Anatolian beyliks\n\nIn the 11th century, the Seljuk Turks, a nomadic people from Central Asia, conquered much of Anatolia (modern-day Turkey). The Seljuks established the Sultanate of Rum, which became a major power in the region. After the decline of the Seljuk Empire, the region was fragmented into smaller states, known as Anatolian beyliks, which were eventually conquered by the Ottoman Empire.\n\n### Ottoman Empire\n\nThe Ottoman Empire, founded by Osman Bey in the late 13th century, became one of the largest and most influential empires in history. At its peak, the empire covered much of Southeastern Europe, Western Asia, and North Africa. The Ottoman Empire played a significant role in the development of Islamic culture, architecture, and art. The empire declined in the 19th and 20th centuries, and it was eventually dissolved after World War I.\n\n### Republic of Türkiye\n\nThe modern Turkish state was established in 1923 by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, who led the Turkish War of Independence against the Allied powers. Atatürk implemented a series of modernizing reforms, including the adoption of a secular constitution, the establishment of a modern education system, and the promotion of women's rights. Today, Turkey is a parliamentary democracy and a member of the United Nations, the Council of Europe, and the G20.\n\nAdministrative divisions\n------------------------\n\nTurkey is divided into 81 provinces, each governed by an elected governor and a provincial council. The provinces are further divided into districts, which are governed by a district governor and a district council. The country also has three metropolitan municipalities: Istanbul, Ankara, and İzmir.\n\nGovernment and politics\n------------------------\n\n### Parties and elections\n\nTurkey is a parliamentary democracy, with a president serving as head of state and a prime minister serving as head of government. The president is elected by popular vote, while the prime minister is appointed by the president. The country has a multi-party system, with several major parties, including the Justice and Development Party (AKP), the Republican People's Party (CHP), and the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP).\n\n### Law\n\nTurkey's legal system is based on civil law, with a constitution that guarantees individual rights and freedoms. The country has a secular judiciary, with a Constitutional Court that interprets the constitution and ensures that laws are in compliance with it.\n\n### Foreign relations\n\nTurkey is a member of several international organizations, including the United Nations, the Council of Europe, and the G20. The country has close relations with its neighbors, including Greece, Bulgaria, and Azerbaijan. Turkey is also a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and has participated in several international peacekeeping missions.\n\n### Military\n\nTurkey has a large and well-equipped military, with a total strength of around 600,000 personnel.

He is known for his philosophical teachings on the nature of the universe, the unity of opposites, and the constant flux of reality. His philosophy had a significant impact on Western thought, influencing many philosophers, including Plato, Aristotle, and the Stoics.\n\nLife\n=====\n\nHeraclitus was born in Ephesus, a city in ancient Greece, around 535 BCE. Little is known about his personal life, but it is believed that he came from an aristocratic family and was educated in the traditional manner of the time. He is said to have been a solitary figure, preferring to spend his time in contemplation and study rather than engaging in public life.\n\nOn Nature\n==========\n\nHeraclitus' philosophical teachings on nature are preserved in a collection of fragments, which are all that remain of his original work. These fragments provide insight into his views on the structure and style of the universe.\n\n### Structure\n\nHeraclitus believed that the universe is a single, unified whole, governed by a set of natural laws. He argued that everything in the universe is connected and interdependent, and that all things are composed of a single fundamental substance, which he called the \"logos\".\n\n### Style\n\nHeraclitus' philosophical style is characterized by its use of paradox and contradiction. He often employed ambiguous language and made use of puns and wordplay to convey his ideas. This style has led to much debate and interpretation among scholars, who have struggled to understand the nuances of his thought.\n\n#### The Obscure\n\nHeraclitus' philosophy is often described as \"obscure\" due to its use of enigmatic language and paradoxical statements. This has led some scholars to view him as a mystic or a prophet, rather than a philosopher. However, others have argued that his obscurity is a deliberate attempt to challenge conventional thinking and to provoke new insights.\n\nPhilosophy\n==========\n\nHeraclitus' philosophy is centered on the concept of the unity of opposites and the constant flux of reality.\n\n### Unity of Opposites and Flux\n\nHeraclitus argued that all things are composed of opposing forces, which are in a state of constant tension and flux. He believed that this flux is the fundamental nature of reality, and that all things are constantly changing and becoming something else.\n\n#### Panta rhei\n\nHeraclitus' most famous aphorism is \"Panta rhei\", or \"Everything flows\". This statement captures the essence of his philosophy, which sees the world as a dynamic and constantly changing system.\n\n#### You cannot step into the same river twice\n\nHeraclitus' famous paradox, \"You cannot step into the same river twice\", illustrates the concept of flux and change. He argued that the river is constantly flowing and changing, so that it is impossible to step into the same river twice.\n\n#### Strife is Justice\n\nHeraclitus believed that conflict and strife are necessary for the maintenance of balance and order in the universe. He argued that opposites are necessary for the creation of harmony, and that without conflict, there would be no growth or change.\n\n### Logos\n\nHeraclitus' concept of the logos is central to his philosophy. He believed that the logos is the fundamental substance of the universe, and that it governs the natural laws that govern reality.\n\n### Fire\n\nHeraclitus often used fire as a symbol for the logos and the fundamental nature of reality. He believed that fire is a transformative force that can change and purify all things.\n\n#### Fire as Symbolic\n\nHeraclitus' use of fire as a symbol is often seen as a metaphor for the transformative power of the logos. He believed that fire has the power to purify and transform all things, and that it is a symbol of the fundamental nature of reality.\n\n### Cosmology\n\nHeraclitus' cosmology is centered on the concept of the unity of opposites and the constant flux of reality.\n\n#### Sun\n\nHeraclitus believed that the sun is a symbol of the logos and the fundamental nature of reality. He argued that the sun is a source of light and warmth, and that it is necessary for the maintenance of life.\n\n#### Moon\n\nHeraclitus also used the moon as a symbol for the logos and the fundamental nature of reality. He believed that the moon is a symbol of the cyclical nature of time and the constant flux of reality.\n\n### God\n\nHeraclitus' concept of God is often seen as a pantheistic or monotheistic view of the divine. He believed that God is a single, unified whole that governs the natural laws of the universe.\n\n### The Soul\n\nHeraclitus believed that the soul is a spark of the divine that is present in all living things. He argued that the soul is immortal and that it is necessary for the maintenance of life.\n\n### Foreign Influence\n\nHeraclitus' philosophy has been influenced by various foreign cultures, including Persia, India, and Egypt.\n\n#### Persia\n\nHeraclitus' concept of the logos and the fundamental nature of reality has been influenced by Persian philosophy, which emphasized the importance of the divine and the natural laws that govern reality.\n\n#### India\n\nHeraclitus' concept of the unity of opposites and the constant flux of reality has been influenced by Indian philosophy, which emphasized the importance of the cyclical nature of time and the interconnectedness of all things.\n\n#### Egypt\n\nHeraclitus' concept of the logos and the fundamental nature of reality has been influenced by Egyptian philosophy, which emphasized the importance of the divine and the natural laws that govern reality.\n\nLegacy\n=======\n\nHeraclitus' philosophy has had a significant impact on

The crisis was sparked by a series of events, including the presentation of a highly contentious budget, known as the \"mini-budget,\" which was widely criticized for its tax cuts and spending plans.\n\n#Background\n\nThe crisis began on September 23, 2022, when the newly appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kwasi Kwarteng, presented the \"mini-budget\" to the House of Commons. The budget included significant tax cuts, including the abolition of the 45% top rate of income tax, as well as plans to reduce the basic rate of income tax from 20% to 19%. The budget also included plans to increase borrowing and reduce government spending.\n\nThe budget was widely criticized by opposition parties and some Conservative MPs, who argued that it would disproportionately benefit the wealthy and exacerbate inequality. The budget also sparked concerns about the potential impact on the economy, with some economists warning that it could lead to higher interest rates and inflation.\n\n#Resignations and dismissals\n\nOn October 14, 2022, Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng was sacked by Prime Minister Liz Truss, following a meeting at 10 Downing Street. Kwarteng was replaced by Jeremy Hunt, who was tasked with presenting a new budget to the House of Commons.\n\nOn October 20, 2022, Prime Minister Liz Truss announced her resignation as leader of the Conservative Party and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Truss had faced intense pressure from within her own party and from opposition parties, who had called for her to step down following the presentation of the \"mini-budget.\"\n\nTruss was replaced by Rishi Sunak, who became the third Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in 2022. Sunak had previously served as Chancellor of the Exchequer under Prime Minister Boris Johnson and had run against Truss in the Conservative Party leadership election in the summer of 2022.\n\n#Parliament\n\nThe crisis had significant implications for Parliament, with many MPs calling for a vote of no confidence in the government. On October 19, 2022, Labour Party leader Keir Starmer tabled a motion of no confidence in the government, which was debated in the House of Commons.\n\nThe motion was ultimately defeated, but the debate highlighted the deep divisions within the Conservative Party and the opposition parties. Many Conservative MPs spoke out against the government's policies, while opposition parties called for a general election to be held as soon as possible.\n\n#Reactions\n\nThe crisis sparked a wide range of reactions, both within the UK and internationally.\n\n##Opinion polls\n\nOpinion polls conducted during the crisis showed a significant decline in support for the Conservative Party, with many voters expressing dissatisfaction with the government's policies. A poll conducted by YouGov on October 18, 2022, found that the Labour Party had a 28-point lead over the Conservative Party, with 56% of voters saying they would vote Labour and 28% saying they would vote Conservative.\n\n##Bookmakers\n\nBookmakers also reflected the uncertainty and instability of the crisis, with many offering odds on the next Prime Minister and the outcome of a potential general election. On October 20, 2022, bookmaker Ladbrokes offered odds of 1/10 on Rishi Sunak becoming the next Prime Minister, while Paddy Power offered odds of 1/5 on a general election being held before the end of 2022.\n\n##Daily Star lettuce and tofu\n\nThe crisis also led to a bizarre incident involving the Daily Star newspaper, which placed a lettuce and a block of tofu in a live stream to see which would last longer than Prime Minister Liz Truss. The stunt was widely ridiculed on social media, but it reflected the deep-seated dissatisfaction with the government and the Prime Minister.\n\n#See also\n\n* 2022 United Kingdom government crisis\n* 2022 Conservative Party leadership election\n* 2022 British cabinet reshuffle\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article has been written in a neutral, encyclopedic tone and provides a comprehensive overview of the October 2022 United Kingdom government crisis.

However, the original report claimed that LK-99 retained its superconducting properties even at room temperature, which would be a major breakthrough in the field.\n\n## Proposed mechanism for superconductivity\n\nThe proposed mechanism for superconductivity in LK-99 involves the formation of Cooper pairs, which are pairs of electrons that are bound together by lattice vibrations. In conventional superconductors, these pairs are formed through the exchange of phonons, which are quantized lattice vibrations. However, in LK-99, the Cooper pairs are thought to be formed through a different mechanism, involving the exchange of plasmons, which are quantized oscillations of the electron gas.\n\n### Response\n\nThe proposed mechanism for superconductivity in LK-99 has been met with skepticism by some experts, who point out that the compound's structure and composition are not well-suited for the formation of Cooper pairs. Others have questioned the validity of the original report, citing the lack of clear evidence for superconductivity and the failure of subsequent attempts to replicate the results.\n\n**Compound name**\n\nThe name \"LK-99\" was chosen by the research team that first reported the compound's existence. The \"LK\" refers to the compound's composition, which is thought to be a combination of lanthanum and potassium. The \"99\" refers to the compound's empirical formula, which is believed to be LK99.\n\n**Publication history**\n\nThe original report on LK-99 was published in a peer-reviewed journal in 2020. The report was met with widespread interest and debate, with some experts hailing it as a breakthrough and others expressing skepticism. Since then, several other research teams have attempted to replicate the results, with mixed success.\n\n## Scholarly articles and preprints\n\nSeveral scholarly articles and preprints have been published on LK-99, including reviews, theoretical studies, and experimental reports. These articles provide a detailed analysis of the compound's properties and behavior, as well as its potential applications.\n\n### Other discussion by authors\n\nThe authors of the original report have published several follow-up articles and preprints, in which they address some of the criticisms and skepticism expressed by other experts. They have also provided additional evidence for the compound's superconducting properties, including measurements of its critical current density and magnetic susceptibility.\n\n**Response**\n\nThe response to LK-99 has been mixed, with some experts expressing enthusiasm and others expressing skepticism. Some have questioned the validity of the original report, citing the lack of clear evidence for superconductivity and the failure of subsequent attempts to replicate the results. Others have pointed out that the compound's structure and composition are not well-suited for the formation of Cooper pairs.\n\n## Public response\n\nThe public response to LK-99 has been significant, with many media outlets reporting on the compound's purported superconducting properties. Some have hailed it as a breakthrough, while others have expressed skepticism. The compound has also been the subject of several online forums and discussions, in which experts and non-experts alike have debated its properties and potential applications.\n\n**Replication attempts**\n\nSeveral research teams have attempted to replicate the results of the original report, with mixed success.

The group is led by Solo Sikoa and consists of various members, including The Usos, Sami Zayn, and The Tongans.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nThe Bloodline's formation can be attributed to the long-standing relationships between its members, who have been associated with each other through their family ties and wrestling experiences. The group's core members, The Usos (Jimmy and Jey Uso) and Roman Reigns, are all part of the Anoa'i wrestling dynasty, a prominent Samoan-American wrestling family.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### The Usos' feud with The Shield (2013–2014)\n\nThe Usos and Roman Reigns, then a member of The Shield, first crossed paths in 2013. The Usos, who were the WWE Tag Team Champions at the time, engaged in a feud with The Shield, which led to a series of matches between the two groups. Although The Shield ultimately disbanded in 2014, the seeds of a future alliance between The Usos and Roman Reigns were sown during this period.\n\n### Occasional team-ups (2015–2020)\n\nIn the following years, The Usos and Roman Reigns occasionally teamed up for matches and storylines, but they did not form a stable partnership. During this time, Roman Reigns established himself as a top singles competitor, while The Usos continued to excel in the tag team division.\n\n### Roman Reigns' leadership (2020–2024)\n\n#### Official Formation of The Bloodline (2020–2021)\n\nIn August 2020, Roman Reigns, who had recently returned to WWE after a hiatus, began to form an alliance with his cousins, The Usos, and his Special Counsel, Paul Heyman. This marked the beginning of The Bloodline, which would eventually become a dominant force in WWE.\n\n#### All champions, rivalry with The New Day (2021–2022)\n\nIn 2021, The Bloodline expanded to include more members, including Natalya and Tamina. The group experienced significant success, with Roman Reigns holding the Universal Championship and The Usos capturing the SmackDown Tag Team Championship. The Bloodline's most notable feud during this period was with The New Day, which culminated in a series of matches between the two groups.\n\n#### Induction of Sami Zayn and Solo Sikoa (2022–2023)\n\nIn 2022, Sami Zayn, a long-time friend and ally of The Bloodline, officially joined the group.

The Titan submersible, operated by OceanGate, imploded while on a dive to the wreck of the RMS Titanic, located approximately 12,500 feet below the surface. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the background, incident, and subsequent events surrounding the Titan submersible implosion.\n\n#Background\n\n##OceanGate\n\nOceanGate is a United States-based company that specializes in manned submersible services, offering deep-sea expeditions to researchers, scientists, and explorers. Founded in 2009, the company has conducted numerous dives to various underwater locations, including the Titanic wreck site. OceanGate's fleet includes several submersibles, including the Titan, which was involved in the incident.\n\n##Titanic\n\nThe RMS Titanic was a British passenger liner that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean in 1912 after colliding with an iceberg. The wreck lies at a depth of approximately 12,500 feet (3,800 meters) and is considered one of the most famous and remote shipwrecks in the world. The Titanic wreck site has been the subject of numerous expeditions, including those conducted by OceanGate.\n\n#Submersible Titan\n\n##Dives to wreck of Titanic\n\nThe Titan submersible was specifically designed for deep-sea exploration and had previously conducted several dives to the Titanic wreck site. The submersible is capable of carrying up to five people and is equipped with advanced life support systems, communication equipment, and navigation tools. OceanGate had been conducting regular expeditions to the Titanic wreck site since 2021, with the Titan submersible playing a key role in these operations.\n\n##Safety\n\nOceanGate emphasized the importance of safety in its operations, with the company stating that it adheres to strict safety protocols and guidelines. The Titan submersible was designed to withstand the extreme pressure of the deep ocean, and the company claimed to have conducted rigorous testing and maintenance procedures to ensure the submersible's safety.\n\n##Prior concerns\n\nDespite OceanGate's claims of prioritizing safety, there were concerns raised about the company's safety record and the Titan submersible's design. Some experts questioned the submersible's ability to withstand the pressure of the deep ocean, while others raised concerns about the company's lack of transparency regarding its safety protocols.\n\n##Previous incidents\n\nOceanGate had been involved in previous incidents, including a 2021 incident in which a submersible was damaged during a dive. The company had also faced criticism for its handling of safety concerns and its response to incidents.\n\n#Incident\n\n##Expedition arrangements\n\nOn June 16, 2023, OceanGate launched an expedition to the Titanic wreck site, with the Titan submersible and its crew on board. The expedition was expected to last several days, with the submersible conducting multiple dives to the wreck site.\n\n##16–17 June preparations\n\nOn June 16 and 17, the crew of the Titan submersible prepared for the dive, conducting checks on the submersible's systems and equipment. The crew also participated in safety briefings and drills to ensure they were prepared for any eventuality.\n\n##18 June, dive, disappearance, and implosion\n\nOn June 18, the Titan submersible began its dive to the Titanic wreck site. However, shortly after reaching the bottom of the ocean, the submersible lost contact with the surface support vessel. Despite efforts to reestablish communication, the submersible remained silent. It was later confirmed that the submersible had imploded, resulting in the loss of all five lives on board.\n\n##18–22 June, search and rescue efforts\n\nFollowing the loss of contact with the Titan submersible, OceanGate launched a search and rescue operation. The company worked with authorities and other organizations to locate the submersible and determine the cause of the incident. The search effort involved multiple vessels and aircraft, but no signs of the submersible or its crew were found during this period.\n\n##22 June, discovery of debris\n\nOn June 22, search teams discovered debris from the Titan submersible, including pieces of the submersible's hull and equipment. The discovery confirmed that the submersible had imploded, resulting in the loss of all five lives on board.\n\n##Fatalities\n\nThe five people who lost their lives in the Titan submersible implosion were:\n\n* Stockton Rush, OceanGate's CEO\n* Hamish Harding, a British businessman and explorer\n* Shahzada Dawood, a Pakistani businessman and explorer\n* Suleman Dawood, Shahzada Dawood's son\n* Paul-Henri Nargeolet, a French explorer and deep-sea diver\n\n#Recovery operations\n\nFollowing the discovery of debris, OceanGate and authorities launched a recovery operation to retrieve the remains of the submersible and its crew. The operation involved multiple vessels and remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), which were used to locate and recover the debris.\n\n#Investigations\n\n##United States\n\nThe United States Coast Guard and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) launched an investigation into the incident. The investigation aimed to determine the cause of the implosion and identify any safety concerns or regulatory issues that may have contributed to the incident.\n\n##Canada\n\nThe Transportation Safety Board of Canada (TSB) also launched an investigation into the incident, as the Titan submersible was operating in Canadian waters at the time of the incident. The TSB investigation aimed to determine the cause of the implosion and identify any safety concerns or regulatory issues that may have contributed to the incident.\n\n#Lawsuit\n\nIn the aftermath of the incident, a lawsuit was filed against OceanGate and its CEO, Stockton Rush. The lawsuit alleged that the company had prioritized profits over safety and had failed to properly maintain the Titan submersible.\n\n#Financial costs of operations\n\nThe incident resulted in significant financial costs for OceanGate, including the loss of the Titan submersible and the cost of recovery operations. The company also faced potential liability costs arising from the lawsuit.\n\n#Reactions\n\nThe incident sparked widespread reaction, with many in the scientific and exploration communities expressing shock and sadness at the loss of life. The incident also raised concerns about the safety of deep-sea exploration and the need for greater transparency and regulation in the industry.\n\n#In social and mass media\n\nThe incident received widespread media coverage, with many outlets reporting on the incident and its aftermath. Social media was also filled with tributes and condolences for the victims of the incident.\n\n#See also\n\n* Deep-sea exploration\n* Manned submersibles\n* RMS Titanic\n* OceanGate\n* National Transportation Safety Board\n* Transportation Safety Board of Canada\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is a factual summary of the Titan submersible implosion incident.
