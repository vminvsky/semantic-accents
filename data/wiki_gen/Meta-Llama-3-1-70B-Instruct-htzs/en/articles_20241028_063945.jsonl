Despite their importance, federal judges are not immune to mortality, and over the years, many have died while still in active service. This article provides an overview of the deaths of United States federal judges in active service, including their background, political and logistical consequences, and a list of judges who have died in active service since 1789.\n\n# Background\n\nFederal judges in the United States are appointed for life, which means that they serve until they resign, retire, or die. The Constitution requires that federal judges be appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, and they are expected to serve for as long as they are able. However, despite their lifetime appointments, federal judges are not immune to mortality, and many have died while still in active service.\n\nThe death of a federal judge can have significant consequences, both politically and logistically. Politically, the death of a judge can create a vacancy that must be filled by the President and confirmed by the Senate, which can be a contentious process. Logistically, the death of a judge can create a significant workload for the remaining judges on the court, who must absorb the deceased judge's caseload and responsibilities.\n\n# Political consequences\n\nThe death of a federal judge can have significant political consequences, particularly if the judge was serving on a court that is closely divided or has a significant impact on the country's jurisprudence. When a judge dies, the President must nominate a replacement, who must then be confirmed by the Senate. This process can be contentious, particularly if the President and the Senate are controlled by different parties.\n\nIn some cases, the death of a judge can create a vacancy that is difficult to fill. For example, if a judge dies during a presidential election year, the President may have difficulty getting a nominee confirmed by the Senate, particularly if the Senate is controlled by the opposing party. In other cases, the death of a judge can create a vacancy that is filled by a judge who has a significantly different judicial philosophy, which can shift the balance of the court.\n\n# Logistical consequences\n\nThe death of a federal judge can also have significant logistical consequences, particularly if the judge was serving on a court with a heavy caseload. When a judge dies, the remaining judges on the court must absorb the deceased judge's caseload and responsibilities, which can create a significant workload.\n\nIn some cases, the death of a judge can create a backlog of cases that must be decided by the remaining judges on the court. This can lead to delays and inefficiencies, particularly if the court is already operating at full capacity. In other cases, the death of a judge can create a vacancy that is filled by a visiting judge, who may not be familiar with the court's procedures or the cases that are pending.\n\n# Lists\n\nThe following lists include federal judges who have died in active service since 1789.\n\n## 1789–1869\n\n* John Blair (1790–1795)\n* James Iredell (1790–1799)\n* William Paterson (1793–1806)\n* Thomas Johnson (1792–1793)\n* John Jay (1795–1796)\n* Oliver Ellsworth (1796–1800)\n* Bushrod Washington (1799–1829)\n* Alfred Moore (1799–1804)\n* John Marshall (1801–1835)\n* Joseph Story (1812–1845)\n* Brockholst Livingston (1806–1823)\n* Thomas Todd (1807–1826)\n* Gabriel Duvall (1811–1835)\n* Smith Thompson (1823–1843)\n* Robert Trimble (1826–1828)\n* John McLean (1830–1861)\n* Henry Baldwin (1830–1844)\n* James Wayne (1835–1867)\n* Roger Taney (1836–1864)\n* Philip Barbour (1836–1841)\n* John Catron (1837–1865)\n* John McKinley (1838–1852)\n* Peter Daniel (1841–1860)\n* Samuel Nelson (1845–1872)\n* Levi Woodbury (1845–1851)\n* Robert Grier (1846–1870)\n* Benjamin Curtis (1851–1857)\n* John Campbell (1853–1861)\n* Nathan Clifford (1858–1881)\n* Noah Haynes Swayne (1862–1881)\n* Stephen Field (1863–1897)\n* David Davis (1862–1877)\n* Salmon Chase (1864–1873)\n* Samuel Miller (1862–1890)\n* Joseph Bradley (1870–1892)\n\n## 1870–1919\n\n* Noah Haynes Swayne (1862–1881)\n* Samuel Nelson (1845–1872)\n* Robert Grier (1846–1870)\n* Salmon Chase (1864–1873)\n* Nathan Clifford (1858–1881)\n* Stephen Field (1863–1897)\n* David Davis (1862–1877)\n* Joseph Bradley (1870–1892)\n* Ward Hunt (1873–1882)\n* John Harlan (1877–1911)\n* William Strong (1870–1880)\n* John M.

The protests were sparked by the country's worst economic crisis in decades, which led to widespread shortages of food, fuel, and medicine. The protests soon turned into a broader movement calling for the resignation of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and his government.\n\n#Background\n\nSri Lanka has been facing a severe economic crisis since 2020, with a significant decline in foreign exchange reserves, a large trade deficit, and high inflation. The crisis was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which had a devastating impact on the country's tourism industry, a major source of foreign exchange earnings. The situation was further complicated by a series of policy mistakes, including a ban on chemical fertilizers, which led to a sharp decline in agricultural production.\n\nIn early 2022, the economic situation in Sri Lanka began to deteriorate rapidly, with long queues for fuel, cooking gas, and other essential goods. The prices of food and other necessities skyrocketed, making it difficult for ordinary people to afford even the basics. The government's response to the crisis was widely criticized as inadequate, and public anger began to build.\n\n#Timeline\n\n##March\n\nThe protests began in March 2022, with small demonstrations in several parts of the country. The protests were initially led by students, activists, and opposition politicians, but soon gained momentum as more and more people joined in. The protesters demanded the resignation of the government, the reversal of austerity measures, and the provision of basic necessities such as food and fuel.\n\n##April\n\n###Declaration of state of emergency\n\nOn April 1, 2022, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa declared a state of emergency, giving the military sweeping powers to quell the protests. The move was widely criticized as an attempt to silence dissent and suppress the protests.\n\n###Social media blocks\n\nThe government also blocked social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, in an attempt to prevent the spread of information about the protests. The move was widely condemned as a violation of freedom of expression.\n\n###Cabinet resignation\n\nOn April 3, 2022, the entire cabinet resigned, except for the president and the prime minister. The move was seen as an attempt to reconstitute the government and regain public trust.\n\n###Reconvening of Parliament\n\nParliament was reconvened on April 5, 2022, after a brief adjournment. The opposition demanded the resignation of the government and the establishment of an interim administration.\n\n###\"Occupy Galle Face\"\n\nOn April 9, 2022, protesters began an \"Occupy Galle Face\" movement, setting up a protest camp near the presidential secretariat in Colombo.

The protests were marked by clashes between protesters and police, resulting in several injuries and arrests.\n\n###Black Monday attacks on protesters\n\nOn May 9, 2022, protesters were attacked by government supporters in several parts of the country.

She was widely recognized for her coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and was considered one of the most prominent Palestinian journalists. Abu Akleh's life was cut short when she was killed while reporting on an Israeli military operation in the West Bank.\n\n#Early life and education\n\nShireen Abu Akleh was born on April 3, 1971, in Jerusalem, to a Palestinian Christian family. Her family was originally from Bethlehem, but her parents had moved to Jerusalem for work. Abu Akleh grew up in the city and attended the Rosary Sisters' school, a Catholic school in the Old City. After completing her secondary education, she enrolled at Yarmouk University in Jordan, where she studied architecture. However, she soon became interested in journalism and began working as a journalist while still a student.\n\n#Career\n\nAbu Akleh began her career in journalism in the 1990s, working for several Palestinian media outlets, including the Voice of Palestine radio station and the Amman Satellite Channel. In 1997, she joined Al Jazeera's Arabic-language channel, where she quickly became a prominent reporter, known for her fearless and objective coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Over the years, Abu Akleh reported on numerous conflicts and events, including the Second Intifada, the Gaza War, and the Israeli disengagement from Gaza. She was also a regular contributor to other media outlets, including the BBC and CNN.\n\nAbu Akleh's reporting style was characterized by her ability to convey complex issues in a clear and concise manner, often from the perspective of ordinary Palestinians. She was widely respected by her colleagues and peers, who praised her professionalism, courage, and dedication to her work. In 2020, she received the Arab Media Award for her coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\n#Death\n\nOn May 11, 2022, Abu Akleh was reporting on an Israeli military operation in the Jenin refugee camp in the West Bank, when she was shot and killed. The Israeli military had launched a raid on the camp, in an effort to arrest suspected Palestinian militants. Abu Akleh was wearing a press vest and a helmet, and was standing with other journalists, when she was hit by a bullet. She was rushed to a nearby hospital, where she was pronounced dead.\n\n##Aftermath\n\nThe killing of Abu Akleh sparked widespread outrage and condemnation, both locally and internationally. The Palestinian Authority, the Arab League, and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation all denounced the killing, and called for an independent investigation. The Israeli government initially claimed that Abu Akleh had been killed by Palestinian gunfire, but later said that it was investigating the incident.\n\n#Funeral\n\nAbu Akleh's funeral was held on May 13, 2022, in Jerusalem. The funeral procession, which was attended by thousands of people, was violently dispersed by Israeli police, who fired tear gas and stun grenades at the mourners. The police claimed that the mourners had thrown stones and had attempted to reach the Western Wall, a sacred Jewish site. However, eyewitnesses disputed this account, saying that the police had attacked the mourners without provocation.\n\n#Reaction\n\nThe killing of Abu Akleh sparked widespread condemnation from governments, media organizations, and human rights groups around the world. The United Nations, the European Union, and the United States all called for an independent investigation into the incident. The Committee to Protect Journalists, a New York-based media advocacy group, denounced the killing as a \"heinous crime\" and called for those responsible to be held accountable.\n\n#Investigations\n\n##Initial Israel investigations\n\nThe Israeli military initially claimed that Abu Akleh had been killed by Palestinian gunfire, but later said that it was investigating the incident. On May 12, 2022, the Israeli military announced that it had launched an investigation into the killing, which would be led by a senior military officer. However, the investigation was widely criticized as inadequate, and many called for an independent inquiry.\n\n##Subsequent investigations\n\nOn May 24, 2022, the Palestinian Authority announced that it had completed its own investigation into the killing, which concluded that Abu Akleh had been deliberately targeted by Israeli soldiers. The investigation found that the soldiers had fired 16 bullets at Abu Akleh, and that she had been killed by a bullet to the head. The report was widely publicized, and was seen as a rebuke to the Israeli government's claims that the killing had been an accident.\n\n##Announcement of US investigation\n\nOn July 4, 2022, the United States Department of State announced that it had launched its own investigation into the killing of Abu Akleh. The investigation, which was led by the FBI, aimed to determine whether Abu Akleh had been deliberately targeted by Israeli soldiers, and whether any US laws had been broken. The announcement was seen as a significant development, and was widely welcomed by human rights groups and media organizations.\n\n##Referral of case to the International Criminal Court\n\nOn August 10, 2022, the Palestinian Authority referred the case of Abu Akleh's killing to the International Criminal Court, which is based in The Hague. The referral was seen as a significant development, and was widely welcomed by human rights groups and media organizations. The ICC is expected to launch its own investigation into the killing, which could potentially lead to charges against those responsible.\n\n#Remembrance and legacy\n\nShireen Abu Akleh's legacy as a journalist and a Palestinian icon continues to be celebrated around the world. Her reporting on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict helped to humanize the Palestinian experience, and to bring attention to the struggles of ordinary Palestinians. Her death has sparked widespread outrage and condemnation, and has led to renewed calls for an end to the Israeli occupation of the West Bank.\n\n#Honors and awards\n\nAbu Akleh received numerous awards and honors for her reporting, including the Arab Media Award, the Palestinian Journalists' Syndicate Award, and the Committee to Protect Journalists' International Press Freedom Award.\n\n#See also\n\n* Israeli-Palestinian conflict\n* Al Jazeera\n* Committee to Protect Journalists\n* International Criminal Court\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is based on information available up to August 2022.\n\n#External links\n\n* Al Jazeera's tribute to Shireen Abu Akleh\n* Committee to Protect Journalists' report on the killing of Shireen Abu Akleh\n* Human Rights Watch's report on the killing of Shireen Abu Akleh", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Shireen_Abu_Akleh\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and education\n#Career\n#Death\n##Aftermath\n#Funeral\n#Reaction\n#Investigations\n##Initial Israel investigations\n##Subsequent investigations\n##Announcement of US investigation\n##Referral of case to the International Criminal Court\n#Remembrance and legacy\n#Honors and awards\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The project has been conducted three times, in 2017, 2022, and 2023, with each iteration featuring a large, blank canvas that users can contribute to in real-time.\n\nOverview\n--------\n\nr/place is a unique experiment in online collaboration and creativity, allowing users to work together to create a massive, shared image. The project is hosted on a dedicated subreddit, where users can place colored pixels on a grid to create a larger image. The canvas is typically divided into a large number of smaller squares, each of which can be claimed and colored by a user.\n\nThe project has been described as a social experiment, allowing users to collaborate and interact with each other in real-time. Users can work together to create complex images and designs, or they can sabotage each other's efforts by placing pixels in opposing colors. The project has also been used to create memes and other forms of internet humor.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### 2017 experiment\n\nThe first r/place experiment was conducted in 2017, to celebrate April Fool's Day. The project featured a 1,000x1,000 pixel canvas, which was divided into 1,000,000 individual squares. Users could place colored pixels on the canvas, which would remain in place for a short period of time before being overwritten by other users.\n\nThe 2017 experiment was a surprise hit, attracting millions of users and generating widespread media attention. The project was covered by major news outlets, including The New York Times, CNN, and BBC News.\n\n### 2022 experiment\n\nThe second r/place experiment was conducted in 2022, five years after the original project. The 2022 experiment featured a 2,000x2,000 pixel canvas, which was divided into 4,000,000 individual squares. The project was launched on April 1, 2022, and ran for 4 days.\n\nThe 2022 experiment was an even bigger success than the original project, attracting over 20 million users and generating widespread media attention. The project was covered by major news outlets, including The Verge, TechCrunch, and Gizmodo.\n\n### 2023 experiment\n\nThe third r/place experiment was conducted in 2023, a year after the previous project. The 2023 experiment featured a 2,500x2,500 pixel canvas, which was divided into 6,250,000 individual squares. The project was launched on March 22, 2023, and ran for 5 days.\n\nThe 2023 experiment was another success, attracting millions of users and generating widespread media attention. The project was covered by major news outlets, including CNN, BBC News, and The New York Times.\n\nMedia response\n-------------\n\nThe r/place project has generated widespread media attention, with major news outlets covering the project and its results. The project has been described as a social experiment, allowing users to collaborate and interact with each other in real-time.\n\nThe project has also been covered by technology and internet media outlets, including TechCrunch, The Verge, and Gizmodo. These outlets have focused on the technical aspects of the project, including the use of Reddit's API and the creation of bots to manipulate the canvas.\n\nAtlas\n-----\n\nThe r/place Atlas is a website that tracks the creation and evolution of the r/place canvas. The Atlas provides a detailed history of the project, including the creation of individual pixels and the changes made to the canvas over time.\n\nThe Atlas is created by a team of volunteers, who use Reddit's API to collect data on the project and create a detailed history of the canvas. The Atlas is available online, and can be used to explore the creation and evolution of the r/place canvas.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Reddit\n* Social experimentation\n* Collaborative art\n* Internet memes\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n[Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements.]\n\nExternal links\n---------------\n\n* r/place subreddit\n* r/place Atlas\n* Reddit API documentation", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"R/place\" following this outline:\n\n#Overview\n#History\n##2017 experiment\n##2022 experiment\n##2023 experiment\n#Media response\n#Atlas\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

These standards define the number of pixels and the arrangement of those pixels on a display, which in turn affect the image quality and overall viewing experience. In this article, we will explore the various display resolution standards, including their history, evolution, and current applications.\n\n# Overview\n\nThe history of display resolution standards dates back to the early days of computing, when monochrome displays were the norm. With the advent of color graphics and the widespread adoption of personal computers, the need for standardized display resolutions became increasingly important. In the 1980s and 1990s, the Video Graphics Array (VGA) and Extended Graphics Array (XGA) standards emerged as the dominant display resolutions for computer monitors. Since then, numerous other standards have been developed to accommodate the growing demands of digital displays, including high-definition (HD) and ultra-high-definition (UHD) resolutions.\n\n# Aspect Ratio\n\nAspect ratio refers to the ratio of a display's width to its height. The most common aspect ratios used in digital displays are 4:3, 16:9, and 16:10. The 4:3 aspect ratio was widely used in older computer monitors and televisions, while the 16:9 aspect ratio has become the standard for modern HDTVs and many computer monitors. The 16:10 aspect ratio is commonly used in widescreen computer monitors and some mobile devices.\n\n# High-definition\n\nHigh-definition (HD) resolutions are characterized by a higher pixel density and a wider aspect ratio than traditional standard-definition (SD) resolutions. HD resolutions are typically used in HDTVs, computer monitors, and mobile devices.\n\n## 640 × 360 (nHD)\n\nnHD, or near-HD, is a resolution that is roughly half the resolution of HD. It is commonly used in mobile devices and some computer monitors.\n\n## 960 × 540 (qHD)\n\nqHD, or quarter-HD, is a resolution that is roughly a quarter of the resolution of HD. It is commonly used in mobile devices and some computer monitors.\n\n## 1280 × 720 (HD)\n\nHD, or high-definition, is a resolution that is commonly used in HDTVs, computer monitors, and mobile devices.\n\n## 1600 × 900 (HD+)\n\nHD+, or high-definition plus, is a resolution that is slightly higher than HD.

The film stars Robert Pattinson as the titular character and is a reboot of the Batman film series. The movie follows Batman as he investigates a series of murders committed by the Riddler, uncovering a larger conspiracy that threatens the city of Gotham.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe film takes place in the second year of Batman's career as a crimefighter. The city of Gotham is plagued by a series of murders committed by the Riddler (Paul Dano), who targets wealthy and influential individuals. As Batman delves deeper into the case, he discovers that the Riddler is not just a serial killer, but a symptom of a larger problem in Gotham. The city is corrupt and rotten to the core, with many of its leaders and institutions complicit in the Riddler's crimes.\n\nBatman's investigation leads him to cross paths with other characters, including Selina Kyle (Zoë Kravitz), a cat burglar with a complicated past, and Oswald Cobblepot (Colin Farrell), a nightclub owner with ties to organized crime. As the story unfolds, Batman must navigate the complex web of alliances and rivalries in Gotham, all while staying one step ahead of the Riddler.\n\n# Cast\n\n* Robert Pattinson as Bruce Wayne / Batman\n* Zoë Kravitz as Selina Kyle / Catwoman\n* Paul Dano as Edward Nashton / Riddler\n* Colin Farrell as Oswald Cobblepot / Penguin\n* Jeffrey Wright as James Gordon\n* John Turturro as Carmine Falcone\n* Andy Serkis as Alfred Pennyworth\n* Peter Sarsgaard as District Attorney Gil Colson\n\n# Production\n\n## Development\n\n### Early work and initial plans from Ben Affleck\n\nThe development of The Batman began in 2014, when Ben Affleck was announced as the star and director of a new Batman film. Affleck had previously played the role of Bruce Wayne / Batman in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016) and Justice League (2017), but his version of the character was met with mixed reviews.\n\nAffleck's plan was to create a standalone Batman film that would explore the character's detective skills and his relationship with other characters in the DC Universe. However, Affleck eventually dropped out of the project due to creative differences and a desire to focus on other projects.\n\n### Redevelopment under Matt Reeves\n\nAfter Affleck's departure, Warner Bros. began searching for a new director to take over the project. Matt Reeves, who had previously directed Cloverfield (2008) and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014), was eventually hired to direct and co-write the film.\n\nReeves brought a new vision to the project, drawing inspiration from classic detective films and comic book stories. He worked closely with writer Peter Craig to develop a script that would focus on Batman's detective skills and his investigation of the Riddler's crimes.\n\n## Writing\n\nThe script for The Batman was written by Matt Reeves and Peter Craig, with a story credit going to Reeves and Craig. The script drew inspiration from a number of sources, including the comic book series \"The Long Halloween\" and \"Batman: Year One\".\n\nReeves and Craig worked closely to develop a script that would explore the complexities of Batman's character and his relationships with other characters in the DC Universe. The script also delved into the themes of class conflict and inequality, highlighting the corruption and decay of the city of Gotham.\n\n## Casting\n\nThe casting process for The Batman began in 2019, with Robert Pattinson being announced as the new Batman. Pattinson was a surprise choice for the role, but he had impressed Reeves with his performance in Good Time (2017).\n\nOther cast members were announced over the course of 2019 and 2020, including Zoë Kravitz as Selina Kyle / Catwoman, Paul Dano as Edward Nashton / Riddler, and Colin Farrell as Oswald Cobblepot / Penguin.\n\n## Design\n\n### Sets and props\n\nThe sets and props for The Batman were designed by James Chinlund, who had previously worked on films such as Dunkirk (2017) and The Last Jedi (2017). Chinlund worked closely with Reeves to create a dark and gritty version of Gotham City, drawing inspiration from classic detective films and comic book stories.\n\nThe sets were built at Warner Bros. Studios in Leavesden, England, with additional filming taking place on location in London and Liverpool.\n\n### Batsuit\n\nThe Batsuit for The Batman was designed by Glyn Dillon, who had previously worked on films such as The Dark Knight Rises (2012) and Interstellar (2014). Dillon worked closely with Reeves to create a new version of the Batsuit that would reflect Batman's detective skills and his connection to the city of Gotham.\n\nThe Batsuit was made from a combination of materials, including leather and Kevlar. It featured a distinctive new design for the cowl, with a more angular and aggressive look.\n\n### Other costumes\n\nThe costumes for The Batman were designed by Jacqueline Durran, who had previously worked on films such as Anna Karenina (2012) and Beauty and the Beast (2017). Durran worked closely with Reeves to create a range of costumes that would reflect the characters' personalities and backgrounds.\n\nThe costumes were made from a range of materials, including wool, cotton, and leather. They were designed to be functional and practical, as well as visually striking.\n\n## Filming\n\n### Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nThe filming of The Batman was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused a number of delays and disruptions. The film was originally scheduled to start shooting in March 2020, but production was delayed until September 2020.\n\nThe cast and crew worked closely to follow safety protocols and minimize the risk of infection. The film was eventually completed in March 2021, with additional filming taking place in April and May 2021.\n\n## Editing\n\nThe editing of The Batman was done by William Hoy, who had previously worked on films such as The Dark Knight (2008) and The Dark Knight Rises (2012). Hoy worked closely with Reeves to create a fast-paced and action-packed edit that would reflect the film's dark and gritty tone.\n\nThe edit was done using Avid Media Composer, with a team of editors working on the film over the course of several months.\n\n## Visual effects\n\nThe visual effects for The Batman were created by Weta Digital, who had previously worked on films such as Avengers: Endgame (2019) and The Lord of the Rings trilogy. The visual effects team was led by Dan Lemmon, who had previously worked on films such as Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014) and The Jungle Book (2016).\n\nThe visual effects were used to create a range of elements, including the Batmobile, the Riddler's puzzles, and the city of Gotham. The team used a combination of techniques, including CGI and practical effects, to create a visually striking and realistic look.\n\n## Music\n\nThe music for The Batman was composed by Michael Giacchino, who had previously worked on films such as Up (2009) and The Incredibles (2004). Giacchino worked closely with Reeves to create a dark and atmospheric score that would reflect the film's tone and themes.\n\nThe score was performed by the London Symphony Orchestra, with additional music being provided by the Bat-signal sound design team. The soundtrack was released in March 2022, to coincide with the film's release.\n\n# Marketing\n\nThe marketing campaign for The Batman began in August 2020, with the release of a teaser trailer at the DC FanDome event. The trailer featured a dark and atmospheric look at the film, with a focus on Batman's detective skills and his investigation of the Riddler's crimes.\n\nAdditional trailers and TV spots were released over the course of 2021 and 2022, with a focus on the film's action sequences and its cast of characters. The marketing campaign also included a range of promotional partnerships, including a tie-in with the video game Batman: Arkham City.\n\n# Release\n\n## Theatrical\n\nThe Batman was released in theaters on March 4, 2022, in the United States and the United Kingdom.

It is one of the last steam locomotives built in the United States and one of the most iconic locomotives in American railroading history.\n\n#Design and abilities\n\nThe Norfolk and Western 611 is a Class J 4-8-4 steam locomotive, meaning it has a 4-8-4 wheel arrangement, with four leading wheels, eight driving wheels, and four trailing wheels. It was designed to haul passenger trains at high speeds, with a top speed of 110 miles per hour. The locomotive is 109 feet 2 inches long and weighs 494,000 pounds. It has a boiler pressure of 300 pounds per square inch and can produce 5,500 horsepower. The locomotive is equipped with a feedwater heater, which helps to improve its efficiency.\n\n#History\n\n##Revenue service\n\nThe Norfolk and Western 611 was built in 1950 and entered revenue service on May 29, 1950. It was assigned to haul the Powhatan Arrow, a passenger train that ran between Norfolk, Virginia, and Cincinnati, Ohio. The locomotive was known for its reliability and speed, and it quickly became a favorite among railfans. During its revenue service, the 611 was based in Roanoke, Virginia, and was maintained by the Norfolk and Western Railway's Roanoke Shops.\n\n##First retirement\n\nThe Norfolk and Western 611 was retired from revenue service in 1959, as the Norfolk and Western Railway began to dieselize its passenger operations. The locomotive was stored in the Roanoke Shops, where it remained for several years.\n\n##First mainline excursion service\n\nIn 1966, the Norfolk and Western 611 was restored to operating condition and began its first mainline excursion service. The locomotive was used to haul excursion trains throughout the eastern United States, and it quickly became a popular attraction. The 611 was known for its powerful running and its distinctive whistle, which could be heard for miles.\n\n##Second retirement\n\nThe Norfolk and Western 611 was retired from excursion service in 1994, due to increasing maintenance costs and declining ridership. The locomotive was stored in the Roanoke Shops, where it remained for several years.\n\n##Second mainline excursion service\n\nIn 2015, the Norfolk and Western 611 was restored to operating condition and began its second mainline excursion service. The locomotive was used to haul excursion trains throughout the eastern United States, and it quickly became a popular attraction once again. The 611 was known for its powerful running and its distinctive whistle, which could be heard for miles.\n\n##Post-NS excursion service\n\nIn 2020, the Norfolk and Western 611 began operating excursion trains under the auspices of the Virginia Museum of Transportation, rather than Norfolk Southern. This marked a new era for the locomotive, as it continued to haul excursion trains throughout the eastern United States.\n\n#Accidents and incidents\n\nDuring its operating career, the Norfolk and Western 611 has been involved in several accidents and incidents. In 1956, the locomotive was involved in a minor derailment in Virginia, but it was quickly repaired and returned to service. In 1973, the locomotive was involved in a more serious accident, when it collided with a freight train in North Carolina. The locomotive suffered significant damage, but it was eventually repaired and returned to service.\n\n#In popular culture\n\nThe Norfolk and Western 611 has appeared in several films and television shows, including the 1966 film \"The Fugitive\" and the 1970s television show \"The Waltons\". The locomotive has also been the subject of several books and articles, and it has been featured on several postage stamps.\n\n#See also\n\n* Norfolk and Western Railway\n* Class J 4-8-4\n* Roanoke Shops\n* Powhatan Arrow\n\n#Notes\n\n* The Norfolk and Western 611 is one of the last steam locomotives built in the United States.\n* The locomotive is known for its powerful running and its distinctive whistle.\n* The 611 has been in operation for over 70 years, and it continues to haul excursion trains throughout the eastern United States.\n\n#References\n\n* None\n\n#Bibliography\n\n* None\n\n#External links\n\n* None", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Norfolk_and_Western_611\" following this outline:\n\n#Design and abilities\n#History\n##Revenue service\n##First retirement\n##First mainline excursion service\n##Second retirement\n##Second mainline excursion service\n##Post-NS excursion service\n#Accidents and incidents\n#In popular culture\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Jackson Women's Health Organization\n\nDobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization is a landmark United States Supreme Court case that overturned the constitutional right to abortion established in Roe v. Wade (1973) and Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992). The case involved a challenge to the Gestational Age Act, a Mississippi law that banned most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The Supreme Court's decision, issued on June 24, 2022, effectively gave individual states the authority to regulate or ban abortion, leading to a significant shift in the country's abortion laws.\n\n**Background**\n\n## Common law\n\nPrior to the Roe v. Wade decision, abortion laws in the United States were primarily based on common law, which prohibited abortion after quickening, the point at which a woman can feel the fetus move. However, many states had enacted laws that restricted or banned abortion, often with exceptions for cases where the woman's life was at risk.\n\n## Constitutional right\n\nIn Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court established a woman's constitutional right to abortion, holding that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protected a woman's decision to terminate her pregnancy. The Court also created a trimester framework, allowing states to regulate or ban abortion in the second and third trimesters. In Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the Court reaffirmed the core holding of Roe and established the undue burden standard, which prohibited states from imposing substantial obstacles to a woman's ability to obtain an abortion.\n\n## Evolution of the composition of the Supreme Court\n\nIn the years following the Casey decision, the composition of the Supreme Court underwent significant changes, with the appointments of conservative justices by Republican presidents. The Court's conservative majority grew with the appointments of Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett, setting the stage for a potential re-examination of the Court's abortion precedents.\n\n**Gestational Age Act**\n\n## Lower courts\n\nIn 2018, Mississippi enacted the Gestational Age Act, which banned most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The law was challenged by Jackson Women's Health Organization, the state's only abortion clinic, and a federal district court enjoined the law, holding that it was unconstitutional under the Casey precedent. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court's decision, and the state of Mississippi petitioned the Supreme Court for review.\n\n**Supreme Court**\n\n## Oral argument\n\nThe Supreme Court heard oral argument in the case on December 1, 2021. During the argument, the justices questioned the parties about the constitutionality of the Gestational Age Act and the Court's abortion precedents. The justices also explored the potential implications of overturning Roe and Casey, including the impact on women's health and the role of the states in regulating abortion.\n\n## Leaked draft opinion\n\nOn May 2, 2022, a draft opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito was leaked to the press, indicating that the Court was poised to overturn Roe and Casey. The draft opinion argued that the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion and that the issue should be returned to the states.\n\n### Reactions\n\nThe leak sparked widespread reaction, with abortion rights supporters condemning the potential decision and anti-abortion groups celebrating the prospect of Roe's reversal.\n\n### Investigation\n\nThe Court launched an investigation into the leak, which was widely condemned as a breach of the Court's confidentiality.\n\n**Opinions**\n\n## Majority opinion\n\nOn June 24, 2022, the Supreme Court issued its decision in Dobbs, with Justice Alito writing the majority opinion. The opinion held that the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion and that the authority to regulate abortion should be returned to the states. The majority opinion also overruled Roe and Casey, effectively ending the constitutional right to abortion.\n\n## Concurrences\n\nJustices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett concurred in the majority opinion, with Justice Thomas writing a separate concurrence arguing that the Court should reconsider other substantive due process precedents.\n\n## Conurrence in judgment\n\nChief Justice John Roberts concurred in the judgment, but wrote a separate opinion arguing that the Court should not have overruled Roe and Casey.\n\n## Dissent\n\nJustices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan dissented, arguing that the majority opinion would have devastating consequences for women's health and equality.\n\n**Impact**\n\n## Pre-decision\n\nPrior to the decision, many states had enacted laws restricting or banning abortion, anticipating the potential reversal of Roe. Other states had enacted laws protecting abortion access, preparing for the possibility that the Court would uphold the constitutional right to abortion.\n\n## Post-decision\n\n### State laws restricting abortion\n\nFollowing the decision, many states moved to restrict or ban abortion, with some laws taking effect immediately. Other states, such as Texas, had \"trigger laws\" that would ban abortion if Roe were overturned.\n\n#### EMTALA and federal preemption\n\nThe Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) requires hospitals to provide emergency medical treatment, including abortion care, to patients in emergency situations. However, the relationship between EMTALA and state abortion laws is unclear, and there is ongoing debate about whether EMTALA preempts state laws restricting abortion.\n\n### State laws expanding abortion access\n\nSome states, such as California and New York, moved to expand abortion access, enacting laws that protect abortion providers and patients from out-of-state lawsuits.\n\n### Congressional proposals\n\nCongressional Democrats proposed legislation to codify the right to abortion, but the bills were met with Republican opposition.\n\n### Executive action by President Biden\n\nPresident Biden issued an executive order directing the Department of Health and Human Services to take steps to protect access to abortion, including ensuring that patients have access to abortion medication.\n\n### Medical abortion, in vitro fertilization, and other processes\n\nThe decision also raised questions about the impact on medical abortion, in vitro fertilization, and other reproductive health services.\n\n### Data privacy\n\nThe decision raised concerns about data privacy, as patients seeking abortion care may be vulnerable to online surveillance and data collection.\n\n### 2022 and 2024 United States election seasons\n\nThe decision is expected to have significant implications for the 2022 and 2024 election seasons, with abortion rights likely to be a major issue in many campaigns.\n\n### Effects on abortion rates\n\nThe decision is likely to have significant effects on abortion rates, as many women may be forced to travel out of state or carry unwanted pregnancies to term.\n\n### Effects on infant mortality\n\nThe decision may also have effects on infant mortality, as many women may be forced to carry pregnancies to term despite lacking access to adequate prenatal care.\n\n**Reaction**\n\n## Legal journalists\n\nLegal journalists widely condemned the decision, arguing that it would have devastating consequences for women's health and equality.\n\n## Political\n\n### Support\n\nAnti-abortion groups celebrated the decision, arguing that it would protect the lives of unborn children.\n\n### Opposition\n\nAbortion rights supporters condemned the decision, arguing that it would undermine women's reproductive autonomy and equality.\n\n## Religious\n\nMany religious leaders weighed in on the decision, with some supporting the reversal of Roe and others opposing it.\n\n## Civil rights\n\nCivil rights groups condemned the decision, arguing that it would disproportionately harm women of color and low-income women.\n\n## Health and education\n\nHealth and education professionals widely condemned the decision, arguing that it would undermine access to reproductive health care and education.\n\n## International\n\nThe decision was widely condemned by international human rights organizations, which argued that it would undermine women's reproductive rights and autonomy.\n\n## News organizations\n\nNews organizations widely covered the decision, with many editorial boards condemning the reversal of Roe.\n\n## Public\n\nPublic reaction to the decision was intense, with many protesters taking to the streets to condemn the reversal of Roe.\n\n## Corporate and celebrity\n\nMany corporations and celebrities weighed in on the decision, with some supporting abortion rights and others opposing them.\n\n**Legacy**\n\n## Cultural and political effects\n\nThe decision is likely to have significant cultural and political effects, as it marks a major shift in the country's abortion laws and politics.\n\n## Medical and sociological effects\n\nThe decision may also have significant medical and sociological effects, as it may lead to increased rates of unintended pregnancy and maternal mortality.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Roe v.

The protests began as a response to COVID-19 vaccine mandates and passports, and eventually grew to include a wide range of grievances against the government. The protests were marked by blockades of major border crossings, as well as demonstrations in cities across the country.\n\n# Background\n\n## Protest goals\n\nThe initial goal of the protest was to oppose COVID-19 vaccine mandates and passports, which had been implemented by the Canadian government. However, as the protest grew, it began to encompass a wide range of grievances, including opposition to mask mandates, lockdowns, and other government restrictions related to the pandemic. Some protesters also expressed opposition to the government's overall handling of the pandemic, as well as broader concerns about government overreach and the erosion of civil liberties.\n\n## Initial events and the start of the protest\n\nThe protest began on January 15, 2022, when a group of truckers and other protesters set out from Vancouver, British Columbia, bound for Ottawa, Ontario. The group was initially organized through social media, and was spurred on by a series of online fundraising campaigns.\n\n### American influence\n\nSome of the initial organizers of the protest had ties to far-right groups in the United States, and the protest received significant support and attention from American conservative media outlets and politicians.\n\n### Fundraising\n\nThe protest was funded in part through online fundraising campaigns, which raised millions of dollars in donations. However, some of the fundraising campaigns were later shut down by crowdfunding platforms, citing concerns about the use of funds.\n\n### Donor list hacked\n\nIn February 2022, a group of hackers released a list of donors to one of the protest's main fundraising campaigns, sparking concerns about the potential for harassment or intimidation of donors.\n\n## Vaccine mandates and passports\n\nThe Canadian government had implemented a series of vaccine mandates and passports in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These measures required individuals to show proof of vaccination in order to access certain public spaces, such as restaurants and shopping malls.\n\n### Vaccination requirements for US–Canada cross-border travel\n\nIn November 2021, the Canadian government announced that it would require truckers crossing the border from the United States to show proof of vaccination. This measure was opposed by some truckers and other protesters, who argued that it would unfairly penalize unvaccinated individuals.\n\n# Convoy to Ottawa\n\nThe convoy of truckers and other protesters arrived in Ottawa on January 28, 2022, and was met by a large crowd of supporters. The convoy was initially peaceful, but eventually grew to include more confrontational elements.\n\n# Ottawa protest\n\nThe Ottawa protest was marked by a series of confrontations between protesters and police, as well as clashes between protesters and local residents.\n\n## Peak size of Parliament Hill demonstration\n\nAt its peak, the demonstration on Parliament Hill drew an estimated 50,000 people.\n\n## Desecration and community harassment\n\nSome protesters were accused of desecrating war memorials and harassing local residents, sparking widespread condemnation.\n\n## Ottawa protests and entrenchment\n\nThe protest in Ottawa became increasingly entrenched, with some protesters setting up tents and other infrastructure in the city's downtown core.\n\n## After clearance\n\nIn February 2022, police cleared out the last of the protesters from the city's downtown core, marking the end of the Ottawa protest.\n\n# Major blockades\n\nIn addition to the protest in Ottawa, the convoy protest also included blockades of several major border crossings.\n\n## Alberta–Montana\n\nA blockade of the Coutts border crossing in Alberta, which connects to Montana in the United States, lasted for several days and caused significant disruptions to trade and travel.\n\n## Ontario–Michigan\n\nA blockade of the Ambassador Bridge, which connects Windsor, Ontario to Detroit, Michigan, also lasted for several days and caused significant disruptions to trade and travel.\n\n# Participants and response\n\n## Groups\n\nA wide range of groups participated in the protest, including truckers, farmers, and other individuals opposed to vaccine mandates and passports.\n\n## Counter-protests\n\nCounter-protests were held in several cities, including Ottawa, Toronto, and Vancouver.\n\n## Ottawa Police Service response\n\nThe Ottawa Police Service was criticized for its response to the protest, which some argued was too slow and inadequate.\n\n## Integrated Command Centre response\n\nThe Integrated Command Centre, which was established to coordinate the response to the protest, was also criticized for its handling of the situation.\n\n### Clearance\n\nThe clearance of the protest was carried out by a combination of local, provincial, and federal police forces.\n\n## Municipal response\n\nMunicipal governments, including the City of Ottawa, responded to the protest by declaring states of emergency and implementing other measures to maintain public order.\n\n## Provincial response\n\nProvincial governments, including the Government of Ontario, also responded to the protest by declaring states of emergency and implementing other measures to maintain public order.\n\n## Federal response\n\nThe federal government responded to the protest by invoking the Emergencies Act, which gave police and other authorities sweeping powers to deal with the situation.\n\n### Emergencies Act\n\nThe Emergencies Act was invoked on February 14, 2022, and remained in place for several weeks.\n\n# Related events\n\n## Other border crossing obstructions\n\nIn addition to the blockades of the Coutts and Ambassador Bridge border crossings, there were also obstructions at several other border crossings.\n\n### British Columbia–Washington\n\nA blockade of the Pacific Highway border crossing in British Columbia, which connects to Washington state in the United States, lasted for several days.\n\n### Manitoba–North Dakota\n\nA blockade of the Emerson border crossing in Manitoba, which connects to North Dakota in the United States, also lasted for

Born on January 8, 1947, in Willimantic, Connecticut, Bonin would go on to become one of the most notorious serial killers in American history.\n\n# Early life\n\n## Childhood\n\nWilliam Bonin was born to George and Alice Bonin, a troubled couple who frequently argued and eventually divorced when Bonin was just eight years old. His father, a World War II veteran, was known to be physically and emotionally abusive to his children. Bonin's mother, Alice, was described as neglectful and often left her children unattended for extended periods. This tumultuous childhood environment had a significant impact on Bonin's psychological development.\n\n## Adolescence\n\nBonin's adolescence was marked by behavioral problems and a lack of academic success. He was repeatedly expelled from school for disciplinary issues and eventually dropped out in the tenth grade. At 16, Bonin was arrested for molesting a younger boy, but the charges were later dropped. This incident foreshadowed the heinous crimes Bonin would commit later in life.\n\n## Engagement and U.S. Air Force\n\nIn 1965, Bonin enlisted in the U.S. Air Force, where he met his future wife, Mary. The couple married in 1968, but their relationship was short-lived, as Bonin's deviant behavior soon resurfaced. While stationed in the Philippines, Bonin was court-martialed for sodomy with a fellow serviceman. He was dishonorably discharged in 1969.\n\n# First convictions\n\nBonin's first conviction occurred in 1969, when he was arrested for molesting several young boys. He was sentenced to five years in prison but served only 16 months. Following his release, Bonin was arrested again in 1971 for kidnapping and assaulting a 17-year-old boy. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison but served only three years before being paroled in 1974.\n\n# Incarceration at Atascadero and Vacaville prison\n\nBonin was incarcerated at Atascadero State Hospital, a maximum-security psychiatric facility, where he was diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder. During his time at Atascadero, Bonin was known to be a model prisoner, participating in group therapy and displaying good behavior. In 1975, Bonin was transferred to Vacaville Prison, where he continued to exhibit good behavior and was eventually paroled in 1978.\n\n## Further offenses and imprisonment\n\nFollowing his release from Vacaville, Bonin continued to commit crimes, including an attempted rape and an assault on a 12-year-old boy. He was arrested again in 1978 and sentenced to three years in prison. Bonin was paroled in 1979, but his release was short-lived, as he would soon embark on a killing spree that would earn him notoriety as the \"Freeway Killer.\"\n\n# Release\n\n## Acquainta", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"William_Bonin\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n##Childhood\n##Adolescence\n##Engagement and U.S. Air Force\n#First convictions\n#Incarceration at Atascadero and Vacaville prison\n##Further offenses and imprisonment\n#Release\n##Acquaintance with Vernon Butts and Gregory Miley\n#Murders\n##1979\n###May\n###August\n###September through December\n##1980\n###January and February\n###March\n###April\n###May\n###June\n#Arrest\n##Confession\n##Accomplices' arrest\n#Preliminary hearings\n#Murder trials\n##Los Angeles County\n###Closing arguments\n###Conviction\n###Sentencing\n##Orange County\n###Second conviction\n#Death row\n##Appeals\n#Execution\n#Aftermath\n#Known victims\n##1979\n##1980\n#Media\n##Film\n##Bibliography\n##Television\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Cited works and further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The film follows the story of four elemental beings, each representing one of the four classical elements: earth, air, fire, and water. The movie takes place in a world where these elemental beings coexist with humans, and the story revolves around their interactions and conflicts.\n\n# Plot\n\nIn the world of Elemental, the four elemental beings live in separate cities, each designed to accommodate their unique abilities and characteristics. The earth elemental, Bernie, lives in a city built into the side of a mountain, while the air elemental, Wade, resides in a city that floats in the sky. The fire elemental, Ember, lives in a city made of lava and flames, and the water elemental, Luna, inhabits a city built underwater.\n\nThe story begins with Bernie, who is struggling to find his place in the world. He feels like an outcast among his fellow earth elementals and longs for adventure and excitement. One day, he meets Ember, who is on a mission to explore the world beyond her city. The two elementals quickly become friends and embark on a journey to discover new lands and meet new people.\n\nHowever, their adventure is cut short when they stumble upon a group of rogue elementals who seek to disrupt the balance of nature. The rogue elementals, led by a powerful and mysterious figure, aim to destroy the harmony between the elemental cities and plunge the world into chaos.\n\nBernie and Ember soon find themselves at the forefront of a battle to save their world. Along the way, they meet Wade and Luna, who join forces with them to defeat the rogue elementals.

Docter teamed up with writer and director Peter Sohn to develop the story and characters.\n\n## Writing\n\nThe screenplay for Elemental was written by Peter Sohn and Brenda Chapman. The two writers drew inspiration from various mythologies and folklores that feature elemental beings.

Levi Miller, Mamoudou Athie, Ronnie del Carmen, and Shila Ommi were chosen to play the four elemental beings, while Mason Cook and Catherine O'Hara joined the cast as human characters.\n\n## Inspiration\n\nThe filmmakers drew inspiration from various sources, including mythology, folklore, and science. They studied the properties and behaviors of the four classical elements, as well as the ways in which humans interact with the natural world. The film's visuals were also inspired by the works of artists such as Hayao Miyazaki and Jean Giraud.\n\n## Animation and design\n\nThe animation and design for Elemental were handled by Pixar Animation Studios. The studio's team of artists and animators used a combination of computer-generated imagery (CGI) and traditional animation techniques to bring the film's world and characters to life. The film's visuals were designed to be highly stylized and fantastical, with a focus on capturing the unique qualities of each elemental being.\n\n# Music\n\nThe score for Elemental was composed by Michael Giacchino. The composer drew inspiration from various musical traditions, including folk, classical, and electronic music. The score features a mix of orchestral and choral pieces, as well as electronic and ambient soundscapes.\n\n# Release\n\n## Marketing\n\nThe marketing campaign for Elemental began in 2022, with the release of the film's first trailer.

Additional trailers and promotional materials were released in the months leading up to the film's release.\n\n## Streaming and home media\n\nElemental was released in theaters on June 16, 2023. The film was also made available for streaming on Disney+, where it premiered on July 21, 2023. The film will be released on home media, including DVD and Blu-ray, in the fall of 2023.\n\n# Reception\n\n## Box office\n\nElemental opened at number one at the box office, grossing $60 million in its opening weekend.

The show premiered on 30 January 2022 on Disney+ Hotstar and concluded on 10 April 2022. The show was hosted by Kamal Haasan and produced by Endemol Shine India.\n\n# Production\n\nThe show was announced on 20 January 2022, and the contestants were revealed on 25 January 2022. The show was filmed at the EVP Film City in Chembarambakkam, Chennai. The show's format was similar to the original Bigg Boss Tamil series, with a group of contestants living together in a specially designed house with cameras and microphones recording their every move.\n\n# Concept\n\nThe concept of Bigg Boss Ultimate Season 1 was similar to the original Bigg Boss Tamil series. A group of contestants, known as \"housemates,\" lived together in a specially designed house with cameras and microphones recording their every move. Each week, the housemates would nominate two of their fellow contestants for eviction, and the contestant with the most nominations would be evicted from the house. The last contestant standing would win the title of Bigg Boss Ultimate and a cash prize of ₹50 lakh.\n\n# Twist in Finale Week\n\nIn the finale week, a twist was introduced where the contestants were given a chance to win a cash prize of ₹25 lakh by completing a task. The task was to stay in a special room in the house for 24 hours without any contact with the outside world. The contestant who completed the task would win the cash prize, but would also be eliminated from the competition.\n\n# Housemates status\n\nThe housemates' status in the show was determined by their performance in the tasks and their behavior in the house. The contestants were given a status of \"safe\" or \"nominated\" each week, depending on whether they were nominated for eviction or not. The contestants who were nominated for eviction were given a chance to save themselves by winning a task or by being saved by their fellow contestants.\n\n# Most Nominated in Eviction\n\nThe contestant who was nominated for eviction the most number of times was Balaji Murugadoss. He was nominated for eviction a total of 6 times during the season.\n\n# Housemates with status improvements\n\nSeveral housemates had their status improved during the season. Abhirami Venkatachalam, who was initially nominated for eviction, was saved by her fellow contestants and later became one of the finalists. Similarly, Thamarai Selvi, who was initially nominated for eviction, was saved by her fellow contestants and later became one of the finalists.\n\n# Overall previous season status\n\nThe contestants who had participated in the previous season of Bigg Boss Tamil had an advantage in the show. They were familiar with the format of the show and had already established themselves as strong contestants. However, they also faced a disadvantage as they were seen as strong contestants by their fellow contestants and were often targeted for nomination.\n\n# Housemates\n\nThe housemates of Bigg Boss Ultimate Season 1 were:\n\n* Abhirami Venkatachalam\n* Anitha Sampath\n* Balaji Murugadoss\n* Julie\n* Niroop Nandakumar\n* Ramya Pandian\n* Rio Raj\n* Shariq Hassan\n* Suresh Chakravarthy\n* Thamarai Selvi\n* Vanitha Vijayakumar\n\n## Wildcard contestants\n\nTwo wildcard contestants, Snehan and Suja Varunee, entered the show on day 14.\n\n# Bigg Boss Ultimate Prison\n\nThe Bigg Boss Ultimate Prison was a special room in the house where contestants who broke the rules of the show were sent. The contestants who were sent to the prison were not allowed to participate in the tasks and were not allowed to interact with their fellow contestants.\n\n# Trending Player\n\nThe Trending Player of the week was awarded to the contestant who was the most popular among the audience. The contestant who was awarded the Trending Player of the week was given a special advantage in the show.\n\n# Cash Reward and Bomb\n\nThe Cash Reward and Bomb was a task where contestants had to search for a cash prize in a room filled with obstacles. The contestants who found the cash prize were awarded a certain amount of money, but the contestants who failed to find the cash prize were given a \"bomb\" which would deduct a certain amount of money from their total earnings.\n\n# Weekly summary\n\nHere is a weekly summary of the show:\n\n* Week 1: The show premiered on 30 January 2022, and the contestants were introduced.\n* Week 2: The first eviction took place, and Julie was evicted from the show.\n* Week 3: The contestants participated in the Cash Reward and Bomb task, and Abhirami Venkatachalam was awarded the Trending Player of the week.\n* Week 4: The contestants participated in the Bigg Boss Ultimate Prison task, and Balaji Murugadoss was sent to the prison.\n* Week 5: The contestants participated in the task to save themselves from nomination, and Thamarai Selvi was saved by her fellow contestants.\n* Week 6: The contestants participated in the task to win a cash prize, and Rio Raj was awarded the cash prize.\n* Week 7: The contestants participated in the task to save themselves from nomination, and Suresh Chakravarthy was saved by his fellow contestants.\n* Week 8: The contestants participated in the task to win a cash prize, and Abhirami Venkatachalam was awarded the cash prize.\n* Week 9: The contestants participated in the task to save themselves from nomination, and Niroop Nandakumar was saved by his fellow contestants.\n* Week 10: The contestants participated in the task to win a cash prize, and Ramya Pandian was awarded the cash prize.\n\n# Nominations table\n\nHere is the nominations table:\n\n| Week | Nominated Contestants | Evicted Contestant |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Julie, Anitha Sampath | None |\n| 2 | Julie, Balaji Murugadoss | Julie |\n| 3 | Abhirami Venkatachalam, Thamarai Selvi | None |\n| 4 | Balaji Murugadoss, Suresh Chakravarthy | None |\n| 5 | Thamarai Selvi, Niroop Nandakumar | None |\n| 6 | Rio Raj, Ramya Pandian | None |\n| 7 | Suresh Chakravarthy, Abhirami Venkatachalam | None |\n| 8 | Niroop Nandakumar, Balaji Murugadoss | None |\n| 9 | Ramya Pandian, Thamarai Selvi | None |\n| 10 | Abhirami Venkatachalam, Rio Raj | Abhirami Venkatachalam |\n\n## Notes\n\n* The nominations table only includes the contestants who were nominated for eviction each week.\n* The contestants who were saved by their fellow contestants are not included in the nominations table.\n\n## Nominations notes\n\n* In week 1, Julie and Anitha Sampath were nominated for eviction, but no one was evicted.\n* In week 2, Julie and Balaji Murugadoss were nominated for eviction, and Julie was evicted.\n* In week 3, Abhirami Venkatachalam and Thamarai Selvi were nominated for eviction, but no one was evicted.\n* In week 4, Balaji Murugadoss and Suresh Chakravarthy were nominated for eviction, but no one was evicted.\n* In week 5, Thamarai Selvi and Niroop Nandakumar were nominated for eviction, but no one was evicted.\n* In week 6, Rio Raj and Ramya Pandian were nominated for eviction, but no one was evicted.\n* In week 7, Suresh Chakravarthy and Abhirami Venkatachalam were nominated for eviction, but no one was evicted.\n* In week 8, Niroop Nandakumar and Balaji Murugadoss were nominated for eviction, but no one was evicted.\n* In week 9, Ramya Pandian and Thamarai Selvi were nominated for eviction, but no one was evicted.\n* In week 10, Abhirami Venkatachalam and Rio Raj were nominated for eviction, and Abhirami Venkatachalam was evicted.\n\n# Guest appearance\n\nSeveral celebrities made guest appearances on the show, including:\n\n* Suriya\n* Karthi\n* Vijay Sethupathi\n* Trisha Krishnan\n* Hansika Motwani\n\n# References\n\nNone\n\n# External links\n\nNone", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Bigg_Boss_Ultimate_season_1\" following this outline:\n\n#Production\n#Concept\n#Twist in Finale Week\n#Housemates status\n#Most Nominated in Eviction\n#Housemates with status improvements\n#Overall previous season status\n#Housemates\n##Wildcard contestants\n#Bigg Boss Ultimate Prison\n#Trending Player\n#Cash Reward and Bomb\n#Weekly summary\n#Nominations table\n##Notes\n##Nominations notes\n#Guest appearance\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The shortage was caused by a combination of factors, including supply chain issues, a recall and plant shutdown, import restrictions, and market concentration. The shortage had significant effects on families with infants, including increased costs, hospitalizations, and the use of alternative foods.\n\n# Causes\n\n## Supply chain issues\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on global supply chains, leading to shortages of many essential goods, including infant formula. The pandemic caused disruptions in production, transportation, and distribution, making it difficult for manufacturers to keep up with demand. Additionally, the pandemic led to an increase in demand for infant formula, as more families turned to formula feeding due to concerns about breastfeeding and the transmission of the virus.\n\n## Recall and plant shutdown\n\nIn February 2022, Abbott Nutrition, a leading manufacturer of infant formula, recalled several of its products due to concerns about contamination with Cronobacter sakazakii, a bacterium that can cause serious illness in infants. The recall included several popular brands, including Similac and EleCare. As a result of the recall, Abbott's plant in Sturgis, Michigan, was shut down for several weeks, further exacerbating the shortage.\n\n### Alleged problems at Sturgis plant\n\nThe Sturgis plant had been the subject of concerns about safety and sanitation prior to the recall. In 2021, the FDA had issued a warning letter to Abbott about alleged problems at the plant, including inadequate cleaning and sanitizing procedures, as well as a lack of proper testing for Cronobacter sakazakii. The FDA also alleged that Abbott had failed to properly investigate complaints about the plant's products.\n\n## Import restrictions\n\nThe United States has strict regulations on the importation of infant formula, which made it difficult for foreign manufacturers to fill the gap in supply caused by the recall and plant shutdown. The FDA requires that imported infant formula meet strict safety and nutritional standards, which can be a barrier to entry for foreign manufacturers.\n\n## Market concentration\n\nThe infant formula market in the United States is highly concentrated, with only a few major manufacturers, including Abbott, Mead Johnson, and Nestle. This concentration can make it difficult for new manufacturers to enter the market, which can exacerbate shortages.\n\n# Effects\n\n## Sale and donation of breast milk\n\nThe shortage led to an increase in the sale and donation of breast milk, as some families turned to alternative sources of nutrition for their infants. However, the sale of breast milk is largely unregulated, which can raise concerns about safety and quality.\n\n## Use of alternative foods\n\nSome families turned to alternative foods, such as cow's milk or goat's milk, as a substitute for infant formula. However, these foods are not nutritionally equivalent to infant formula and can be hazardous for infants if not properly prepared.\n\n## Hospitalizations\n\nThe shortage led to an increase in hospitalizations of infants who were not receiving adequate nutrition. In some cases, infants were hospitalized due to dehydration or malnutrition caused by the lack of access to infant formula.\n\n## Bot usage\n\nThe shortage also led to an increase in the use of bots to buy up infant formula, which can exacerbate the shortage and drive up prices.\n\n## Shortage in Canada\n\nThe shortage also affected Canada, where infant formula is also in short supply. The Canadian government took steps to restrict the export of infant formula to the United States, which further exacerbated the shortage.\n\n# Responses\n\n## Efforts to prevent price gouging\n\nSeveral states and cities took steps to prevent price gouging, including imposing price controls and fines on retailers who were found to be price gouging.\n\n## Efforts to increase supply\n\nThe FDA took steps to increase the supply of infant formula, including allowing the importation of foreign formula and relaxing labeling requirements.\n\n## Efforts to restore production\n\nAbbott Nutrition took steps to restore production at its Sturgis plant, including implementing new safety and sanitation procedures.\n\n## Investigations\n\n### Congressional investigation\n\nCongress launched an investigation into the shortage, including hearings and a report on the causes of the shortage.\n\n### FDA investigation\n\nThe FDA launched an investigation into the recall and plant shutdown, including an inspection of the Sturgis plant.\n\n### ABC News investigation\n\nABC News launched an investigation into the shortage, including a report on the alleged problems at the Sturgis plant.\n\n### DOJ investigation\n\nThe Department of Justice launched an investigation into price gouging and other alleged wrongdoing related to the shortage.\n\n# Commentary\n\n## Breast milk vs. formula debate\n\nThe shortage reignited the debate about breast milk vs. formula, with some advocates arguing that breastfeeding is the best option for infants, while others argue that formula is a necessary and safe alternative.\n\n## Criticism of federal response\n\nThe federal response to the shortage was criticized by some, who argued that the government did not act quickly enough to address the shortage.\n\n### White House response\n\nThe White House was criticized for its response to the shortage, including a statement by Press Secretary Jen Psaki that the administration was \"working to address\" the shortage.\n\n### Formula availability at the Southern border\n\nThe shortage also raised questions about the availability of formula at the Southern border, where migrant families are often unable to access infant formula.\n\n# See also\n\n* Infant formula\n* Breast milk\n* Cronobacter sakazakii\n* FDA\n* Abbott Nutrition\n* Mead Johnson\n* Nestle", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_United_States_infant_formula_shortage\" following this outline:\n\n#Causes\n##Supply chain issues\n##Recall and plant shutdown\n###Alleged problems at Sturgis plant\n##Import restrictions\n##Market concentration\n#Effects\n##Sale and donation of breast milk\n##Use of alternative foods\n##Hospitalizations\n##Bot usage\n##Shortage in Canada\n#Responses\n##Efforts to prevent price gouging\n##Efforts to increase supply\n##Efforts to restore production\n##Investigations\n###Congressional investigation\n###FDA investigation\n###ABC News investigation\n###DOJ investigation\n#Commentary\n##Breast milk vs. formula debate\n##Criticism of federal response\n###White House response\n###Formula availability at the Southern border\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He gained widespread recognition and acclaim for his record-breaking swims, particularly his successful crossing of the Catalina Channel in 1927.\n\n# Early swimming achievements\n\nYoung's passion for swimming began at a young age, and he quickly demonstrated a natural talent for the sport. He began competing in local swimming events and soon gained a reputation as a formidable long-distance swimmer.\n\n## Catalina swim training\n\nIn the mid-1920s, Young set his sights on the prestigious Catalina Channel swim, a 22-mile stretch of water separating Catalina Island from the California mainland. To prepare for this daunting task, Young embarked on an intensive training program, swimming lengthy distances in Lake Ontario and honing his endurance.\n\n# Catalina channel swim\n\nOn August 15, 1927, Young successfully completed the Catalina Channel swim, finishing in a time of 22 hours and 45 minutes. This remarkable achievement garnered widespread attention and solidified Young's position as one of the world's top long-distance swimmers.\n\n## Swam with tides\n\nYoung's strategy for the Catalina Channel swim involved carefully planning his route to take advantage of the strong tidal currents. By swimming with the tides, he was able to significantly reduce his swimming time and conserve energy.\n\n## Competition from Norman Ross\n\nYoung's achievement was all the more impressive given the strong competition he faced from Norman Ross, a highly accomplished Australian swimmer who had attempted the Catalina Channel swim several times. Ross was known for his exceptional endurance and had previously set several long-distance swimming records.\n\n## Public acclaim, with limited financial gain\n\nDespite the widespread recognition and acclaim Young received for his Catalina Channel swim, he struggled to capitalize financially on his achievement. At the time, there were limited sponsorship opportunities and prize purses for long-distance swimming events, leaving Young to rely on modest winnings and donations from supporters.\n\n# Inconsistent swimming career\n\nYoung's swimming career was marked by inconsistency, with periods of intense competition and training followed by periods of relative inactivity. This inconsistency was likely due to a combination of factors, including limited financial resources, personal commitments, and the physical and mental demands of long-distance swimming.\n\n## 1927, 21-Mile Lake Ontario swim\n\nIn 1927, Young competed in a 21-mile Lake Ontario swim, finishing in a respectable time of 11 hours and 30 minutes. This event marked one of the few times Young swam in a shorter distance event, and his performance demonstrated his versatility as a swimmer.\n\n## 1928, 15-Mile Lake Ontario swim\n\nIn 1928, Young competed in a 15-mile Lake Ontario swim, finishing in a time of 7 hours and 30 minutes. This event was one of several shorter distance swims Young participated in during this period, as he sought to maintain his fitness and competitive edge.\n\n## Wins Sept 1928 Montreal to Repentigney Marathon\n\nOn September 15, 1928, Young won the prestigious Montreal to Repentigney Marathon, a 25-mile swim down the St. Lawrence River. This victory marked one of the highlights of Young's swimming career and cemented his reputation as one of the world's top long-distance swimmers.\n\n## 1929, 15-mile Lake Ontario swim\n\nIn 1929, Young competed in another 15-mile Lake Ontario swim, finishing in a time of 7 hours and 15 minutes. This event marked one of the few times Young swam in a shorter distance event during this period, and his performance demonstrated his continued fitness and competitive edge.\n\n## 1930, 15-mile Lake Ontario swim\n\nIn 1930, Young competed in a 15-mile Lake Ontario swim, finishing in a time of 7 hours and 30 minutes. This event was one of several shorter distance swims Young participated in during this period, as he sought to maintain his fitness and competitive edge.\n\n## Wins 1931 Lake Ontario win\n\nOn August 15, 1931, Young won a 26-mile Lake Ontario swim, finishing in a time of 17 hours and 30 minutes. This victory marked one of the highlights of Young's swimming career and cemented his reputation as one of the world's top long-distance swimmers.\n\n## Late swim career\n\nYoung's swimming career began to wind down in the mid-1930s, as he faced increased competition from younger swimmers and struggled to maintain his fitness and competitive edge. Despite this, Young continued to participate in occasional swimming events and maintained a strong connection to the swimming community.\n\n# Swim retirement and marriage\n\nIn the late 1930s, Young officially retired from competitive swimming, citing a combination of physical and mental exhaustion. He went on to marry twice, first to a woman named Margaret and later to a woman named Helen.\n\n## Marriages\n\nYoung's first marriage to Margaret was a long and happy one, lasting over 30 years until her passing in the 1970s. His second marriage to Helen was a shorter one, lasting only a few years until his passing in the 1970s.\n\n# Late professional life\n\nFollowing his retirement from swimming, Young went on to pursue a career in business, working in various management roles for several companies. He also remained involved in the swimming community, serving as a coach and mentor to younger swimmers.\n\n# Honors\n\nYoung's numerous achievements in long-distance swimming earned him widespread recognition and accolades. He was inducted into the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame in 1958 and the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 1968.\n\n# See also\n\n* Long-distance swimming\n* Open water swimming\n* Catalina Channel swim\n\n# External links\n\n* International Swimming Hall of Fame\n* Canadian Sports Hall of Fame\n* Catalina Channel Swimming Federation", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"George_Young_(swimmer)\" following this outline:\n\n#Early swimming achievements\n##Catalina swim training\n#Catalina channel swim\n##Swam with tides\n##Competition from Norman Ross\n##Public acclaim, with limited financial gain\n#Inconsistent swimming career\n##1927, 21-Mile Lake Ontario swim\n##1928, 15-Mile Lake Ontario swim\n##Wins Sept 1928 Montreal to Repentigney Marathon\n##1929, 15-mile Lake Ontario swim\n##1930, 15-mile Lake Ontario swim\n##Wins 1931 Lake Ontario win\n##Late swim career\n#Swim retirement and marriage\n##Marriages\n#Late professional life\n#Honors\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The league is considered one of the premier country football competitions in New South Wales, attracting players from across the state and providing a high level of competition for local footballers.\n\n## Merger with the Farrer Football League\n\nIn 2019, the CRFL merged with the Farrer Football League to form a new competition, known as the Riverina Football League. The merger was intended to strengthen country football in the Riverina region and provide a more competitive and sustainable competition for local clubs. However, the merger was met with resistance from some clubs, and in 2020, the CRFL was re-established as a standalone competition.\n\n# Football Clubs\n\nThe following clubs currently participate in the Central Riverina Football League:\n\n* Ariah Park-Mirrool Rams\n* Barellan Two Blues\n* Binya-Grong Grong-Matong Saints\n* Coolamon Rovers\n* Ganmain-Grong Grong-Matong Lions\n* Leeton Whippets\n* Narrandera Imperials\n* North Wagga Kangaroos\n* Turvey Park Bulldogs\n* Wagga Tigers\n* Whitton-Tullibigeal Bombers\n* Yanco-Wamoon Saints\n\nEach club has its own unique history, culture, and traditions, and the CRFL is proud to promote and celebrate the diversity of its member clubs.\n\n# Football Grand Finals\n\nThe Central Riverina Football League has a rich history of exciting and closely contested grand finals.

The acquisition process began in April 2022 and was completed on October 27, 2022. This article will provide an overview of the events leading up to the acquisition, the buyout offer, the attempted termination, and the eventual completion of the purchase.\n\n# Prelude\n\n## Background\n\nTwitter, founded in 2006, had become one of the most widely used social media platforms in the world. The company had gone public in 2013 and had struggled to maintain profitability in the face of increased competition from other social media platforms. In 2022, Twitter's market capitalization was around $40 billion.\n\nElon Musk, a prolific user of Twitter, had been a vocal critic of the platform's moderation policies and had expressed interest in acquiring the company. Musk had previously acquired Instagram and had expressed interest in acquiring other social media platforms.\n\n## Early developments\n\nIn January 2022, Elon Musk began acquiring shares of Twitter, eventually amassing a 9.2% stake in the company. Musk's stake in Twitter made him the company's largest shareholder, surpassing the stake held by Twitter's CEO, Parag Agrawal.\n\nMusk's acquisition of Twitter shares sparked speculation about his intentions for the company. Some speculated that Musk would attempt to take control of the company, while others believed that he would use his stake to influence Twitter's moderation policies.\n\n# Buyout offer\n\n## Takeover bid\n\nOn April 14, 2022, Elon Musk announced a takeover bid for Twitter, offering to purchase the company for $54.20 per share. The offer valued Twitter at around $43 billion.\n\nMusk's takeover bid was seen as a surprise move by many in the tech industry. Twitter's board of directors initially rejected Musk's offer, citing concerns about the company's value and the potential impact on shareholders.\n\n## Acquisition announcement\n\nOn April 25, 2022, Twitter's board of directors announced that the company had accepted Musk's offer. The acquisition was subject to regulatory approval and was expected to be completed by the end of 2022.\n\nMusk's acquisition of Twitter was seen as a major development in the tech industry. Many speculated about the potential implications of Musk's ownership of Twitter, including the potential impact on the company's moderation policies and the potential for increased censorship.\n\n# Attempted termination\n\n## Alleged hold\n\nIn May 2022, Elon Musk announced that the acquisition of Twitter was \"on hold\" due to concerns about the number of fake accounts on the platform. Musk claimed that Twitter's estimates of the number of fake accounts on the platform were too low and that he needed more information before proceeding with the acquisition.\n\nTwitter's board of directors pushed back against Musk's claims, stating that the company had provided Musk with accurate information about the number of fake accounts on the platform.\n\n## Attempted withdrawal by Musk\n\nOn July 8, 2022, Elon Musk announced that he was withdrawing his offer to acquire Twitter. Musk claimed that Twitter had breached its obligations under the merger agreement and that he was no longer interested in acquiring the company.\n\nTwitter's board of directors responded by filing a lawsuit against Musk, seeking to compel him to complete the acquisition. The lawsuit claimed that Musk had breached his obligations under the merger agreement and that he was attempting to use fake account concerns as a pretext to withdraw from the deal.\n\n# Revival and closing\n\n## Revitalization of bid\n\nOn October 4, 2022, Elon Musk announced that he was reviving his bid to acquire Twitter. Musk's decision to revive the bid came after a Delaware court ruled that Twitter's lawsuit against him could proceed.\n\nMusk's decision to revive the bid was seen as a surprise move by many in the tech industry. Some speculated that Musk had realized that he would be unable to withdraw from the deal without facing significant financial penalties.\n\n## Completion of purchase\n\nOn October 27, 2022, Elon Musk completed his acquisition of Twitter. Musk's acquisition of the company was valued at around $44 billion.\n\nMusk's acquisition of Twitter was seen as a major development in the tech industry. Many speculated about the potential implications of Musk's ownership of Twitter, including the potential impact on the company's moderation policies and the potential for increased censorship.\n\n## Post-acquisition\n\nFollowing the completion of the acquisition, Elon Musk announced that he would be taking over as CEO of Twitter. Musk's decision to take over as CEO was seen as a surprise move by many in the tech industry.\n\nMusk's first moves as CEO of Twitter included the firing of several top executives, including the company's CEO, Parag Agrawal. Musk also announced plans to reduce Twitter's workforce and to introduce new features to the platform.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## Takeover bid\n\nElon Musk's takeover bid for Twitter was met with a mixed reaction from the tech industry. Some praised Musk's decision to acquire the company, citing his ability to bring innovation and disruption to the platform.\n\nOthers were more skeptical, citing concerns about Musk's ability to manage a company with a large workforce and complex moderation policies.\n\n## Acquisition announcement\n\nThe announcement that Twitter had accepted Musk's takeover bid was met with a mixed reaction from investors. Twitter's stock price rose sharply following the announcement, but some investors expressed concerns about the potential implications of Musk's ownership of the company.\n\n## Attempted termination\n\nElon Musk's decision to put the acquisition of Twitter \"on hold\" was met with a negative reaction from investors. Twitter's stock price fell sharply following the announcement, and some investors expressed concerns about Musk's ability to complete the deal.\n\n## Completion of purchase\n\nThe completion of Musk's acquisition of Twitter was met with a mixed reaction from the tech industry. Some praised Musk's decision to acquire the company, citing his ability to bring innovation and disruption to the platform.\n\nOthers were more skeptical, citing concerns about Musk's ability to manage a company with a large workforce and complex moderation policies.\n\n# Critical analysis\n\n## Takeover bid and acquisition announcement\n\nElon Musk's takeover bid for Twitter was seen as a surprise move by many in the tech industry.

The film is the long-awaited sequel to the 2009 film Avatar, which became the highest-grossing film of all time upon its release. The Way of Water continues the story of Jake Sully and Neytiri as they navigate the consequences of their actions in the first film and face new challenges in the world of Pandora.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe film takes place 13 years after the events of the first film and follows Jake Sully and Neytiri as they build a life together in the forest of Pandora. However, their tranquility is disrupted by the return of human colonizers, led by Colonel Miles Quaritch, who seeks revenge against Jake for his role in the humans' defeat in the first film. As tensions rise, Jake and Neytiri must protect their family and the Na'vi people from the human threat.\n\nMeanwhile, Jake and Neytiri's son, Neteyam, becomes increasingly restless and seeks to prove himself as a worthy successor to his parents' legacy. The family is also joined by a young boy named Spider, a human who was left behind during the human evacuation of Pandora and has been adopted by the Sully family.\n\nAs the conflict between humans and Na'vi escalates, Jake and Neytiri take their family to the underwater realm of the Metkayina, a group of Na'vi who live in harmony with the sea creatures of Pandora.
