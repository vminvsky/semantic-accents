It is the sequel to Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (2018) and the sixth installment in the Jurassic Park franchise. The film takes place four years after the events of the previous installment and follows a group of characters as they navigate a world where dinosaurs and humans coexist.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film takes place in a world where dinosaurs have been released into the wild and are living among humans. The story follows Owen Grady (Chris Pratt), a former Velociraptor trainer who is now living in the wilderness with his partner, Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard). The two are tasked with rescuing a group of genetically engineered dinosaurs, including a young Velociraptor named Beta, who have been stolen by a group of mercenaries.\n\nMeanwhile, a new threat emerges in the form of a giant locust infestation that is threatening the world's food supply. The locusts are revealed to be genetically engineered by a biotech company called Biosyn, which is led by a wealthy and ruthless CEO named Lewis Dodgson (Campbell Scott). As the story unfolds, Owen and Claire team up with a group of allies, including Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill), Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), and Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), to take down Biosyn and stop the locust infestation.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Chris Pratt as Owen Grady\n* Bryce Dallas Howard as Claire Dearing\n* Laura Dern as Dr. Ellie Sattler\n* Sam Neill as Dr. Alan Grant\n* Jeff Goldblum as Dr. Ian Malcolm\n* DeWanda Wise as Kayla Watts\n* Mamoudou Athie as Ramsay Cole\n* Isabella Sermon as Maisie Lockwood\n* Campbell Scott as Lewis Dodgson\n* BD Wong as Dr. Henry Wu\n* Omar Sy as Barry Sembène\n* Justice Smith as Franklin Webb\n* Daniella Pineda as Dr. Zia Rodriguez\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development\n\nJurassic World Dominion was first announced in February 2018, with Colin Trevorrow set to return as director and co-writer.

He is best known for his involvement in the creation and leadership of the Direcția Generală a Securității Poporului (DGSP), Romania's secret police agency, and his implementation of various repressive policies and atrocities during his tenure.\n\n# Biography\n\n## Youth and imprisonment\n\nGheorghe Pintilie was born on February 9, 1902, in the village of Buftea, Ilfov County, Romania. His early life was marked by poverty and hardship, and he was forced to drop out of school at a young age to work as a laborer. In 1924, Pintilie joined the Romanian Communist Party (PCR), which was then an underground organization. His involvement with the party led to his arrest and imprisonment in 1928, along with several other communist activists. Pintilie spent several years in prison, where he became acquainted with other prominent communist figures, including Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej.\n\n## Communist rise\n\nFollowing his release from prison in 1933, Pintilie continued his involvement with the PCR, gradually rising through the party ranks. In 1944, he became a member of the party's Central Committee, and in 1945, he was appointed as the head of the PCR's organizational department. Pintilie's position within the party allowed him to play a key role in the communist takeover of Romania following World War II.\n\n## DGSP creation\n\nIn 1948, Pintilie was appointed as the head of the newly created Direcția Generală a Securității Poporului (DGSP), Romania's secret police agency. The DGSP was modeled after the Soviet Union's NKVD and was responsible for suppressing opposition to the communist regime, as well as for implementing various repressive policies. Pintilie's leadership of the DGSP marked the beginning of a period of intense repression and terror i", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Gheorghe_Pintilie\" following this outline:\n\n#Biography\n##Youth and imprisonment\n##Communist rise\n##DGSP creation\n##Pushing for atrocities\n##Brainwashing experiment\n##In the power struggles\n##Political isolation\n##Downfall\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The outbreak affected multiple states, including Louisiana, Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, and Tennessee. This article provides an overview of the meteorological conditions that led to the outbreak, the confirmed tornadoes that occurred during the event, and the non-tornadic effects and impact of the outbreak.\n\n#Meteorological synopsis\n\nA powerful winter storm system developed over the southern Great Plains on December 11, 2022, and began to move eastward. As the system strengthened, it brought a mass of cold air from Canada, which collided with warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico. This clash of air masses created a highly unstable atmosphere, conducive to thunderstorm development. The Storm Prediction Center (SPC) issued a Moderate Risk (4/5) outlook for severe thunderstorms on December 12, which was later upgraded to a High Risk (5/5) for parts of Louisiana, Texas, and Oklahoma.\n\nAs the system continued to move eastward, it brought a strong cold front, which swept across the affected areas, producing a long-lived squall line. The combination of strong wind shear, instability, and lift from the cold front created a favorable environment for tornadoes to develop. The SPC continued to issue High Risk outlooks for severe thunderstorms on December 13 and 14, as the system moved into the southeastern United States.\n\n#Confirmed tornadoes\n\nA total of 67 tornadoes were confirmed during the outbreak, with the majority occurring on December 13. The tornadoes were rated on the Enhanced Fujita scale (EF scale), with the strongest being an EF4.\n\n##December 12 event\n\nOn December 12, a total of 5 tornadoes were confirmed, all of which occurred in Oklahoma and Texas. The strongest tornado was an EF2, which occurred in Caddo County, Oklahoma, causing significant damage to homes and businesses.\n\n##December 13 event\n\nDecember 13 was the most active day of the outbreak, with a total of 34 tornadoes confirmed. The tornadoes occurred across Louisiana, Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas. The strongest tornado of the day was an EF4, which occurred in Farmerville, Louisiana, causing catastrophic damage and loss of life.\n\n##December 14 event\n\nOn December 14, a total of 16 tornadoes were confirmed, all of which occurred in Louisiana, Texas, and Oklahoma. The strongest tornado of the day was an EF3, which occurred in Red River County, Texas, causing significant damage to homes and businesses.\n\n##December 15 event\n\nOn December 15, a total of 12 tornadoes were confirmed, all of which occurred in Tennessee, Missouri, and Arkansas. The strongest tornado of the day was an EF2, which occurred in Weakley County, Tennessee, causing significant damage to homes and businesses.\n\n##Farmerville, Louisiana\n\nThe Farmerville, Louisiana EF4 tornado was the strongest and deadliest of the outbreak. The tornado touched down at approximately 2:30 PM CST and remained on the ground for approximately 20 miles. The tornado caused catastrophic damage to homes, businesses, and infrastructure, and resulted in 7 fatalities and over 50 injuries.\n\n#Non-tornadic effects\n\nIn addition to the tornadoes, the outbreak also produced significant non-tornadic effects, including strong winds, large hail, and flash flooding. The strong winds caused widespread power outages, with over 100,000 households affected. The large hail caused significant damage to crops and vehicles, while the flash flooding caused evacuations and disruptions to transportation.\n\n#Impact\n\nThe tornado outbreak had a significant impact on the affected areas, with widespread damage and loss of life. The total damage estimate was over $1 billion, making it one of the costliest tornado outbreaks in U.S. history. The outbreak also caused significant disruptions to transportation, commerce, and daily life.\n\n#See also\n\n* List of tornado outbreaks\n* Tornado Alley\n* Storm Prediction Center\n* Enhanced Fujita scale\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is a summary of the tornado outbreak and is not intended to be a comprehensive or exhaustive account.

Launched on July 14, 2023, the mission aims to demonstrate the capability to soft-land on the lunar surface and conduct scientific experiments. Chandrayaan-3 follows the Chandrayaan-1 mission, which was launched in 2008 and included an orbiter and an impactor, and the Chandrayaan-2 mission, which was launched in 2019 and included an orbiter, a lander, and a rover.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 mission was conceived after the partial success of the Chandrayaan-2 mission. Although the Chandrayaan-2 orbiter continues to orbit the Moon and provide valuable scientific data, the lander and rover were lost due to a technical malfunction during the descent phase. ISRO decided to develop a new lander and rover, leveraging the experience and expertise gained from the previous mission. The Chandrayaan-3 mission was formally approved in November 2019, with a planned launch in 2023.\n\nObjectives\n----------\n\nThe primary objectives of the Chandrayaan-3 mission are:\n\n1. To demonstrate the capability to soft-land on the lunar surface\n2. To conduct scientific experiments on the lunar surface\n3. To demonstrate the capability to operate a rover on the lunar surface\n4. To study the lunar surface composition, geology, and atmosphere\n\nSpacecraft\n----------\n\n### Design\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft consists of three main components: the propulsion module, the Vikram lander, and the Pragyan rover.\n\n#### Propulsion module\n\nThe propulsion module is the main spacecraft that provides the necessary propulsion, power, and communication for the mission. It is equipped with a high-gain antenna for communication with Earth and a propulsion system consisting of a liquid-fueled engine.\n\n#### Vikram lander\n\nThe Vikram lander is designed to soft-land on the lunar surface. It is equipped with a descent imaging camera, a laser altimeter, and a terrain relative navigation system to ensure precise landing. The lander is also equipped with a suite of scientific instruments to study the lunar surface composition and geology.\n\n#### Rover Pragyan\n\nThe Pragyan rover is a small, six-wheeled rover designed to operate on the lunar surface. It is equipped with a suite of scientific instruments, including an alpha-proton X-ray spectrometer, a laser-induced breakdown spectrometer, and a seismometer. The rover is designed to move at a speed of 1 cm/s and has a power source consisting of solar panels and batteries.\n\nPayloads\n--------\n\n### On lander\n\nThe Vikram lander carries a suite of scientific instruments, including:\n\n* Descent imaging camera: to capture high-resolution images of the lunar surface during descent\n* Laser altimeter: to measure the distance between the lander and the lunar surface\n* Terrain relative navigation system: to ensure precise landing\n* Seismometer: to measure seismic activity on the lunar surface\n* Langmuir probe: to study the lunar surface plasma\n\n### On rover\n\nThe Pragyan rover carries a suite of scientific instruments, including:\n\n* Alpha-proton X-ray spectrometer: to study the lunar surface composition\n* Laser-induced breakdown spectrometer: to study the lunar surface geology\n* Seismometer: to measure seismic activity on the lunar surface\n\n### On the propulsion module\n\nThe propulsion module carries a suite of scientific instruments, including:\n\n* High-gain antenna: for communication with Earth\n* Propulsion system: consisting of a liquid-fueled engine\n* Power source: consisting of solar panels and batteries\n\nMission profile\n--------------\n\n### Launch\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 mission was launched on July 14, 2023, at 02:35 UTC from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, India. The launch vehicle used was the LVM3 (GSLV Mk III).\n\n### Orbit\n\nAfter launch, the spacecraft entered into a highly elliptical orbit around Earth. The orbit was raised through a series of orbit-raising maneuvers, and the spacecraft finally entered into a lunar transfer orbit.\n\n### Landing\n\nThe Vikram lander separated from the propulsion module on August 23, 2023, and descended towards the lunar surface. The lander successfully soft-landed on the lunar surface in the south polar region.\n\n### Surface operations\n\nThe Pragyan rover was deployed on the lunar surface on August 24, 2023. The rover began its scientific experiments, including studying the lunar surface composition and geology.\n\n### Propulsion module reinserted to orbit around Earth\n\nAfter the lander and rover were deployed, the propulsion module reinserted into orbit around Earth. The module will continue to orbit Earth for several years, providing communication relay services for future Indian space missions.\n\n### Mission life\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 mission is designed to have a mission life of one year. However, the mission life can be extended based on the performance of the spacecraft and the scientific instruments.\n\nTeam\n----\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 mission is led by a team of experienced scientists and engineers from ISRO.

The violence has resulted in significant loss of life, displacement of people, and widespread destruction of property.\n\n#Background\n\n##Scheduled Tribe status for Meitei\n\nThe demand for Scheduled Tribe (ST) status for the Meitei community, the majority ethnic group in Manipur, has been a contentious issue for several years. The Meitei community has been seeking ST status, which they believe would provide them with greater protection and benefits under the Indian Constitution. However, this demand has been opposed by several other ethnic groups in the state, who fear that it would lead to the Meitei community dominating the state's politics and economy.\n\n##Political background\n\nManipur has a complex and sensitive political landscape, with several ethnic groups vying for power and influence. The state has a long history of insurgency and militancy, with several armed groups operating in the region. The state government has struggled to maintain law and order, and the situation has been further complicated by the presence of several non-state actors, including armed groups and civil society organizations.\n\n##Refugees from Myanmar\n\nThe influx of refugees from Myanmar, particularly the Chin community, has added to the complexity of the situation in Manipur. Many of these refugees have settled in the state, leading to tensions with the local population. The state government has struggled to provide adequate support and services to these refugees, leading to further social and economic tensions.\n\n##International factors\n\nThe situation in Manipur has also been influenced by international factors, particularly the situation in Myanmar. The ongoing conflict in Myanmar has led to a significant influx of refugees into Manipur, putting pressure on the state's resources and infrastructure. Additionally, the state's proximity to the international border has made it vulnerable to cross-border militant activities.\n\n#Antecedents\n\nThe violence in Manipur has its roots in a series of events that took place in the months leading up to May 2023. Tensions had been building between the Meitei community and other ethnic groups in the state, particularly the Kuki and Naga communities. The demand for ST status for the Meitei community had been gaining momentum, and several other ethnic groups had begun to mobilize against it.\n\nIn April 2023, a series of clashes took place between Meitei and Kuki groups in several parts of the state, resulting in several injuries and deaths. The state government had imposed curfew in several areas, but the situation remained tense.\n\n#Overview\n\n##Initial riots\n\nOn May 3, 2023, a series of riots broke out in several parts of Manipur, particularly in the Imphal Valley. The riots were sparked by a clash between Meitei and Kuki groups, and quickly spread to other parts of the state. Several buildings and vehicles were set on fire, and several people were injured.\n\n##Government response\n\nThe state government responded quickly to the violence, imposing curfew in several areas and deploying security forces to affected regions. However, the situation remained volatile, with several clashes taking place between security forces and rioters.\n\n##Recurrent violence\n\nDespite the efforts of the state government, the violence continued to recur in several parts of the state. Several armed groups, including the Kuki National Organisation (KNO) and the United Naga Council (UNC), became involved in the violence, leading to further escalation.\n\n##Warring groups\n\nSeveral warring groups have been involved in the violence, including the Meitei, Kuki, and Naga communities. The situation has been further complicated by the presence of several non-state actors, including armed groups and civil society organizations.\n\n##Casualties and victims\n\nThe violence has resulted in significant loss of life, with several hundred people killed or injured. Several thousand people have been displaced, and widespread destruction of property has taken place.\n\n#Supreme Court proceedings\n\nThe Supreme Court of India has taken suo moto cognizance of the violence in Manipur, and has ordered the state government to take immediate action to restore law and order. The court has also ordered the state government to provide adequate compensation to victims of the violence.\n\n#Reactions\n\nThe violence in Manipur has sparked widespread condemnation from across the country. Several civil society organizations and human rights groups have criticized the state government for its handling of the situation, and have called for greater action to protect the rights of marginalized communities.\n\n#Media coverage\n\nThe violence in Manipur has received widespread media coverage, both nationally and internationally. Several news organizations have reported on the violence, highlighting the complexity of the situation and the need for greater action to restore peace and stability.\n\n#See also\n\n* Scheduled Tribes of India\n* Meitei people\n* Kuki people\n* Naga people\n* Insurgency in Northeast India\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is a general overview of the 2023-2024 Manipur violence.

The libretto, written by Rafael Hertzberg, is based on a Swedish ballad of the same name. The opera premiered in 1896 but was withdrawn by the composer after only a few performances, and it remained largely forgotten until its posthumous revival in the 1980s.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\n### Composition\n\nThe Maiden in the Tower was composed in 1896, during a period of intense creative activity for Sibelius. The opera was written quickly, with the composer working on the score in just a few weeks. The libretto, written by Rafael Hertzberg, is based on a traditional Swedish ballad of the same name, which tells the story of a young woman imprisoned in a tower by her mother.\n\n### Premiere\n\nThe Maiden in the Tower premiered on November 7, 1896, at the Royal Swedish Opera in Stockholm. The production was directed by August Lindberg, and the title role was sung by soprano Emmy Achté. The premiere was not a success, with many critics finding the opera's music and libretto to be dull and unengaging.\n\n### Withdrawal and suppression\n\nDespite the initial failure of the premiere, The Maiden in the Tower was performed a few more times in the following years. However, Sibelius eventually withdrew the opera from circulation, and it was not performed again during his lifetime. The composer's decision to withdraw the opera was likely due to his own dissatisfaction with the work, as well as the negative reception it received from critics and audiences.\n\n### Posthumous revival\n\nThe Maiden in the Tower was revived in the 1980s, more than 70 years after its premiere. The opera was performed in a number of productions throughout Europe and North America, and it has since been recognized as a significant work in Sibelius's oeuvre. The posthumous revival of The Maiden in the Tower has been attributed to a growing interest in Sibelius's early works, as well as a reevaluation of the opera's music and libretto.\n\nStructure and roles\n-------------------\n\nThe Maiden in the Tower is an opera in one act, with a total of five roles:\n\n* The Maiden: soprano\n* The Mother: mezzo-soprano\n* The Lover: tenor\n* The Servant: baritone\n* The Herald: bass\n\nSynopsis\n--------\n\nThe opera takes place in a medieval castle, where the Maiden is imprisoned in a tower by her mother. The Maiden's lover, a knight, arrives at the castle and attempts to rescue her. However, the Mother discovers their plan and imprisons the Lover in the tower as well. The Servant, who is sympathetic to the lovers, helps them to escape, and they are reunited in the final scene.\n\nMusic\n------\n\nThe music of The Maiden in the Tower is characterized by its use of leitmotifs, which were a common feature of Sibelius's operas. The opera's score also features a number of folk-inspired melodies, which were influenced by Sibelius's interest in traditional Finnish music. The opera's orchestration is notable for its use of a large orchestra, which includes a number of unusual instruments, such as the contrabassoon and the English horn.\n\nContext and analysis\n---------------------\n\n### The plot as allegory\n\nThe plot of The Maiden in the Tower has been interpreted as an allegory for the struggle for Finnish independence. The Maiden, who is imprisoned in the tower by her mother, represents the Finnish people, who were subject to Russian rule at the time the opera was written. The Lover, who attempts to rescue the Maiden, represents the Finnish nationalist movement, which was seeking to free Finland from Russian control.\n\n### Opera and Finland's language strife\n\nThe Maiden in the Tower was written during a period of intense language strife in Finland, which was a Grand Duchy of Russia at the time. The opera's libretto, which was written in Swedish, was seen as a symbol of the Swedish-speaking elite, who dominated Finnish society and politics. However, the opera's music, which was influenced by traditional Finnish folk melodies, was seen as a expression of Finnish nationalism.\n\n### Later opinions of Sibelius's music\n\nThe Maiden in the Tower was initially received negatively by critics and audiences, who found the opera's music and libretto to be dull and unengaging. However, in the years following its premiere, Sibelius's music became increasingly popular, and he was recognized as one of the leading composers of his generation. The posthumous revival of The Maiden in the Tower has been attributed to a growing interest in Sibelius's early works, as well as a reevaluation of the opera's music and libretto.\n\n### Reasons for post-1981 neglect\n\nDespite its posthumous revival, The Maiden in the Tower has been relatively neglected in recent years. The opera's neglect has been attributed to a number of factors, including its limited availability on recording and its perceived lack of dramatic interest. However, the opera's music and libretto continue to be recognized as significant works in Sibelius's oeuvre, and it remains an important part of the composer's legacy.\n\nDiscography\n------------\n\n* 1981: EMI Classics (conducted by Okko Kamu)\n* 1993: BIS Records (conducted by Leif Segerstam)\n* 2007: Naxos Records (conducted by Sakari Oramo)\n\nNotes, references, and sources\n------------------------------\n\n(No citations or references are included in this article.)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"The_Maiden_in_the_Tower\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Composition\n##Premiere\n##Withdrawal and suppression\n##Posthumous revival\n#Structure and roles\n#Synopsis\n#Music\n#Context and analysis\n##The plot as allegory\n##Opera and Finland's language strife\n##Later opinions of Sibelius's music\n##Reasons for post-1981 neglect\n#Discography\n#Notes, references, and sources\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The origins and meaning of this symbol are complex and multifaceted, and its use has been the subject of controversy and debate.\n\nMilitary Use\n------------\n\n### Description\n\nThe \"Z\" symbol is often displayed on military equipment, vehicles, and uniforms. It is typically rendered in a bold, white, or yellow font on a black or green background. In some cases, the symbol may be accompanied by other markings or insignia.\n\n### Purpose\n\nThe primary purpose of the \"Z\" symbol is to identify military units or vehicles as belonging to a specific force or faction. In some cases, the symbol may be used to signify a particular mission or operation. The use of the \"Z\" symbol can also serve as a form of psychological warfare, intended to intimidate or demoralize enemy forces.\n\n### Naming\n\nThe origins of the \"Z\" symbol are unclear, and it is not certain how it came to be associated with military forces. Some theories suggest that the symbol may have been chosen for its simplicity and ease of recognition, while others propose that it may have been inspired by the Cyrillic letter \"Z\" (З), which is similar in appearance to the Latin letter \"Z\".\n\nUse as Pro-War Symbolism\n-------------------------\n\n### Russian State\n\nIn 2022, the \"Z\" symbol became closely associated with the Russian state and its military actions in Ukraine. Russian troops and vehicles were seen displaying the symbol, and it was also used in pro-war propaganda and social media campaigns. The Russian government did not officially explain the meaning of the symbol, but it was widely seen as a sign of support for the Russian military and its actions.\n\n### Other\n\nThe use of the \"Z\" symbol has not been limited to Russia or its military. Other groups and individuals have also adopted the symbol, often in a show of solidarity with Russian forces or as a form of anti-Western or anti-NATO sentiment. In some cases, the symbol has been used by extremist or nationalist groups.\n\nAnalysis\n--------\n\nThe use of the \"Z\" symbol as a military symbol and pro-war propaganda tool has been the subject of much analysis and debate. Some have seen the symbol as a clever and effective form of psychological warfare, while others have criticized it as a crude and transparent attempt to intimidate or manipulate public opinion.\n\nInternational Censure\n-------------------\n\n### By Governments\n\nThe use of the \"Z\" symbol has been widely condemned by governments around the world.

Regarded as one of the most successful Hong Kong action heroines of all time, Yeoh has also gained international recognition for her dramatic roles in films like \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\" and \"Crazy Rich Asians\". With a career spanning over three decades, Yeoh has solidified her position as a leading lady in both Eastern and Western cinema.\n\nEarly life and education\n------------------------\n\nMichelle Yeoh was born on August 6, 1962, in Ipoh, Perak, Malaysia. Her father, Yeoh Kian Teik, was a lawyer and politician, and her mother, Janet Yeoh, was a housewife. Yeoh's early life was marked by a blend of Chinese and Malaysian cultures, which would later influence her career choices. She began taking ballet lessons at the age of four and later attended the Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus in Ipoh. In 1980, Yeoh moved to London to study ballet at the Royal Academy of Dance.\n\nCareer\n--------\n\n### Early career and first retirement (1983–1991)\n\nYeoh's entry into the entertainment industry began with her participation in the Miss Malaysia World pageant in 1983, which she won. This victory led to her being crowned Miss World Malaysia and representing Malaysia at the Miss World pageant in London. Although she did not win the international title, Yeoh's exposure at the pageant caught the attention of a Hong Kong film producer, who offered her a film contract. Yeoh made her film debut in 1983 with the action-comedy \"The Owl vs. Dumbo\" and went on to star in a string of successful films throughout the 1980s, including \"Twinkle, Twinkle, Lucky Stars\" and \"Magnificent Warriors\".\n\nIn 1987, Yeoh married Hong Kong businessman Dickson Poon and announced her retirement from acting.

She began taking on more action-oriented roles, showcasing her physical abilities and martial arts skills. Films like \"Police Story 3: Supercop\" and \"The Heroic Trio\" solidified Yeoh's status as a leading action heroine in Hong Kong cinema. Her success in the action genre also led to opportunities in Hollywood, with roles in films like \"Tomorrow Never Dies\" and \"Enter the Eagles\".\n\n### Career fluctuations (2002–2016)\n\nIn the early 2000s, Yeoh's career experienced a period of fluctuation. She continued to work in Hong Kong cinema, but her roles became less frequent and less prominent. Yeoh also faced increased competition from younger actresses, which led to a decline in her popularity. However, she continued to work in television and film, taking on a mix of dramatic and action-oriented roles.\n\nIn 2008, Yeoh starred in the critically acclaimed film \"Babylon A.D.\", which marked a turning point in her career. The film's success led to increased recognition for Yeoh, and she began to take on more prominent roles in international productions.\n\n### Supporting roles (2017–2020)\n\nIn the late 2010s, Yeoh began to focus on supporting roles in film and television. She appeared in films like \"Crazy Rich Asians\" and \"Star Trek: Discovery\", which showcased her ability to play complex and nuanced characters. Yeoh's performances in these roles earned her critical acclaim and recognition within the industry.\n\n### Award success (2021–present)\n\nIn 2021, Yeoh starred in the film \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\", which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. The film's success led to widespread critical acclaim for Yeoh, with many praising her performance as one of the best of her career. Yeoh went on to win several awards for her performance, including the Academy Award for Best Actress.\n\nActivism\n----------\n\nThroughout her career, Yeoh has been involved in various charitable and philanthropic efforts. In 2008, she was appointed as a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations Development Programme, focusing on issues related to poverty and inequality. Yeoh has also been involved in several environmental initiatives, including the conservation of wildlife and the protection of natural habitats.\n\nPersonal life\n-------------\n\nYeoh has been married to French businessman Jean Todt since 2004. The couple has no children together, but Todt has two children from a previous relationship. Yeoh is a practicing Buddhist and has stated that her faith has had a significant impact on her life and career.\n\nFilmography\n------------\n\nMain article: Michelle Yeoh filmography\n\nAccolades\n----------\n\n### Honours\n\n#### Honours of Malaysia\n\n* Tan Sri (2013)\n* Dato' Seri (2001)\n* Dato' (1997)\n\n#### Foreign honours\n\n* Chevalier de la Légion d'Honneur (France, 2007)\n* Officer of the Order of Arts and Letters (France, 2003)\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* List of Malaysian actresses\n* List of Hong Kong actresses\n* List of action heroines\n\nExplanatory notes\n-----------------\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nFurther reading\n--------------\n\n* \"Michelle Yeoh: My Life in Action\" by Michelle Yeoh\n* \"The Michelle Yeoh Story\" by Ian Johnston\n\nExternal links\n---------------\n\n* Michelle Yeoh at IMDb", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Michelle_Yeoh\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and education\n#Career\n##Early career and first retirement (1983–1991)\n##Return as an action star (1992–2001)\n##Career fluctuations (2002–2016)\n##Supporting roles (2017–2020)\n##Award success (2021–present)\n#Activism\n#Personal life\n#Filmography\n#Accolades\n##Honours\n###Honours of Malaysia\n###Foreign honours\n#See also\n#Explanatory notes\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The fires were fueled by hot and dry weather conditions, strong winds, and dry vegetation, and resulted in significant damage, loss of life, and displacement of residents.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Wildfire risk\n\nHawaii is considered a high-risk state for wildfires due to its dry climate, rugged terrain, and strong winds. The state's unique geography, with its mountainous islands and coastal areas, creates a variety of ecosystems that are prone to wildfires. The risk of wildfires in Hawaii is further exacerbated by the presence of invasive plant species, such as fountain grass and christmas berry, which can fuel fires and spread quickly.\n\n### Weather factors\n\nThe weather conditions in August 2023 were ideal for wildfires. A high-pressure system brought hot and dry air to the islands, with temperatures soaring above 90°F (32°C) and humidity levels dropping below 20%. Strong winds, gusting up to 50 mph (80 km/h), also contributed to the spread of the fires.\n\n**List of wildfires**\n\nHere is a list of some of the major wildfires that burned in Hawaii in 2023:\n\n* Kula Fire (Maui)\n* Lahaina Fire (Maui)\n* Pūlehu-Kīhei Fire (Maui)\n* Mauna Loa Fire (Hawaiʻi Island)\n* North Shore Fire (Oʻahu)\n\n**Timeline**\n\n### Maui\n\n#### Kula\n\nThe Kula Fire started on August 8, 2023, in the Kula region of Maui. The fire quickly spread due to strong winds and dry vegetation, burning over 1,000 acres of land. Residents in the area were forced to evacuate, and several homes were destroyed.\n\n#### Lahaina\n\nThe Lahaina Fire started on August 10, 2023, in the Lahaina region of Maui. The fire burned over 500 acres of land, forcing the evacuation of several hundred residents. The fire also damaged several businesses and historic buildings in the area.\n\n#### Pūlehu-Kīhei\n\nThe Pūlehu-Kīhei Fire started on August 11, 2023, in the Pūlehu-Kīhei region of Maui. The fire burned over 2,000 acres of land, forcing the evacuation of several thousand residents. The fire also damaged several homes and businesses in the area.\n\n#### Other fires\n\nSeveral other fires burned on Maui, including the Olinda Fire, the Makawao Fire, and the Haliimaile Fire. These fires burned over 1,000 acres of land and forced the evacuation of several hundred residents.\n\n### Hawaiʻi Island\n\nThe Mauna Loa Fire started on August 12, 2023, on the Big Island of Hawaiʻi. The fire burned over 5,000 acres of land, forcing the evacuation of several hundred residents. The fire also damaged several homes and businesses in the area.\n\n### Oʻahu\n\nThe North Shore Fire started on August 14, 2023, on the North Shore of Oʻahu. The fire burned over 1,000 acres of land, forcing the evacuation of several hundred residents. The fire also damaged several homes and businesses in the area.\n\n**Impact**\n\n### Casualties\n\nThe 2023 Hawaii wildfires resulted in several fatalities and injuries. Several residents were forced to evacuate their homes, and many were left without power or access to basic necessities.\n\n### Damage\n\nThe fires caused significant damage to homes, businesses, and infrastructure. Several historic buildings and landmarks were also damaged or destroyed.\n\n### Environment\n\nThe fires had a significant impact on the environment, with many acres of land burned and several endangered species affected.\n\n### Evacuations\n\nSeveral thousand residents were forced to evacuate their homes due to the fires. Many were left without power or access to basic necessities.\n\n### Wildlife and pets\n\nMany animals, including pets and wildlife, were affected by the fires. Several animal shelters were set up to care for displaced animals.\n\n**Legal proceedings**\n\nSeveral lawsuits were filed against the state and federal governments, as well as private companies, for their role in the fires. The lawsuits alleged negligence and failure to properly prepare for and respond to the fires.\n\n**Response**\n\n### Federal government\n\nThe federal government provided assistance to the state of Hawaii, including funding and personnel. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) was activated to provide support to affected residents.\n\n### State government\n\nThe state government of Hawaii responded quickly to the fires, with the governor declaring a state of emergency. The state provided funding and personnel to support affected residents.\n\n### International assistance\n\nSeveral countries provided assistance to Hawaii, including:\n\n#### Japan\n\nJapan provided funding and personnel to support affected residents.\n\n#### South Korea\n\nSouth Korea provided funding and personnel to support affected residents.\n\n#### Taiwan\n\nTaiwan provided funding and personnel to support affected residents.\n\n#### Hungary\n\nHungary provided funding and personnel to support affected residents.\n\n### Fundraising and donations\n\nSeveral fundraising campaigns were set up to support affected residents, with many individuals and organizations donating money and supplies.\n\n### Concerns about preparedness\n\nThe 2023 Hawaii wildfires raised concerns about the state's preparedness for natural disasters.

The crisis was sparked by a series of scandals and controversies surrounding Johnson's leadership, culminating in a wave of resignations by senior government ministers.\n\nBackground\n\nBoris Johnson had been Prime Minister since July 2019, when he succeeded Theresa May as leader of the Conservative Party. During his tenure, Johnson's government was marked by controversy and scandal, including the COVID-19 pandemic, Brexit, and allegations of impropriety and corruption. Despite these challenges, Johnson's government had maintained a relatively stable majority in the House of Commons, thanks in part to the support of his own party and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).\n\nHowever, in the months leading up to the crisis, Johnson's popularity had begun to decline, and his government was facing growing criticism from within his own party and from opposition parties. The final straw came in early July 2022, when a series of scandals broke, including the resignation of Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak and the revelation of a party held at 10 Downing Street during the COVID-19 lockdown.\n\nCollapse of the government\n\nThe crisis began on July 5, 2022, when Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak and Health Secretary Sajid Javid resigned from the government, citing a loss of confidence in Johnson's leadership. The resignations were followed by a wave of other departures, including those of several junior ministers and parliamentary private secretaries.\n\nSupport for Johnson\n\nDespite the wave of resignations, Johnson initially maintained the support of his party and refused to step down. However, as the crisis deepened, it became increasingly clear that his position was untenable. On July 7, 2022, Johnson's newly appointed Chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi, publicly called for him to resign, and several other senior ministers followed suit.\n\nResignation of Boris Johnson\n\nOn July 7, 2022, Boris Johnson announced his resignation as leader of the Conservative Party and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. In a statement outside 10 Downing Street, Johnson acknowledged that he had lost the support of his party and that it was time for him to step down.\n\nReactions\n\nDomestic\n\nThe reaction to Johnson's resignation was mixed, with some commentators praising his achievements as Prime Minister, while others criticized his handling of the crisis. The opposition Labour Party welcomed the news, with leader Keir Starmer calling for a general election. The Liberal Democrats also called for an election, while the Scottish National Party (SNP) called for another independence referendum.\n\nInternational\n\nInternationally, the reaction to Johnson's resignation was largely neutral, with many world leaders expressing appreciation for his service as Prime Minister. The European Union's Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, praised Johnson's commitment to the Brexit agreement, while the United States' President, Joe Biden, expressed appreciation for his partnership on global issues.\n\nList of departures\n\nThe following is a list of senior government ministers and officials who resigned during the crisis:\n\n* Rishi Sunak, Chancellor of the Exchequer\n* Sajid Javid, Health Secretary\n* Nadhim Zahawi, Chancellor of the Exchequer\n* Grant Shapps, Transport Secretary\n* Mark Spencer, Leader of the House of Commons\n* Michelle Donelan, Education Secretary\n* Chris Philp, Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Secretary\n* Rachel Maclean, Minister for Safeguarding\n* Mims Davies, Employment Minister\n* Alex Chalk, Solicitor General\n\nSee also\n\n* Premiership of Boris Johnson\n* Conservative Party (UK)\n* 2019 United Kingdom general election\n* Brexit\n* COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom\n\nNotes\n\nThis article is a general overview of the July 2022 United Kingdom government crisis.

The dam's destruction has had far-reaching consequences, affecting not only the local population but also the environment, military operations, and the economy.\n\n#Background\n\nThe Kakhovka Dam was constructed in the 1950s as part of the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Plant, which was designed to provide hydroelectric power and irrigation for the surrounding agricultural region. The dam was located near the city of Nova Kakhovka, in the Kherson Oblast of Ukraine. The dam's reservoir, Lake Kakhovka, was an important source of water for irrigation, drinking water, and industrial use.\n\nIn 2014, following the Russian annexation of Crimea, the dam's operation was taken over by Russian-backed forces. Since then, the dam has been the subject of controversy, with Ukraine accusing Russia of using the dam as a tool for exerting control over the region's water supply.\n\n#Destruction\n\nOn June 6, 2023, at approximately 02:50 local time, the Kakhovka Dam was destroyed, resulting in a massive release of water from the reservoir. The cause of the destruction is disputed, with Ukraine and Russia pointing fingers at each other. The destruction of the dam was reportedly caused by an explosion, which was captured on video by local residents.\n\n#Responsibility\n\nThe question of responsibility for the destruction of the Kakhovka Dam remains a contentious issue.

The term \"eukaryote\" comes from the Greek words \"eu\" meaning true and \"karyon\" meaning nut or kernel, referring to the presence of a true nucleus. Eukaryotes are incredibly diverse, ranging from single-celled organisms like protists to complex multicellular organisms like plants, animals, and fungi.\n\n#Diversity\n\nEukaryotes can be found in almost every habitat on Earth, from the freezing tundra to the hottest deserts, and from the surface of the ocean to the deepest parts of the sea. They come in a wide range of shapes and sizes, from the tiny, single-celled protists that are barely visible to the naked eye, to the massive, multicellular organisms like whales and redwood trees.\n\nEukaryotes can be broadly classified into several groups, including:\n\n* Protists: single-celled eukaryotes that do not fit into any other category\n* Fungi: organisms that obtain their nutrients by decomposing organic matter or by forming symbiotic relationships with other organisms\n* Plants: organisms that make their own food through photosynthesis\n* Animals: organisms that obtain their nutrients by consuming other organisms or organic matter\n\n#Distinguishing features\n\nEukaryotes have several distinct features that set them apart from other forms of life.\n\n##Nucleus\n\nThe most distinctive feature of eukaryotes is the presence of a true nucleus, which houses the cell's genetic material. The nucleus is surrounded by a double membrane called the nuclear envelope, which regulates the movement of materials in and out of the nucleus.\n\n##Biochemistry\n\nEukaryotes have a unique set of biochemical processes that allow them to carry out essential functions like metabolism, DNA replication, and protein synthesis. For example, eukaryotes use a process called linear chromosomes to organize their genetic material, whereas prokaryotes use circular chromosomes.\n\n##Internal membranes\n\nEukaryotes have a complex system of internal membranes that divide the cell into separate compartments, each with its own unique function. These membranes include the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus, and the lysosomes.\n\n##Mitochondria\n\nMitochondria are organelles found in eukaryotic cells that are responsible for generating energy for the cell through cellular respiration. Mitochondria are thought to have evolved from a group of bacteria that were engulfed by the ancestors of eukaryotes.\n\n##Plastids\n\nPlastids are organelles found in plant cells that are responsible for carrying out photosynthesis. Like mitochondria, plastids are thought to have evolved from a group of bacteria that were engulfed by the ancestors of plants.\n\n##Cytoskeletal structures\n\nEukaryotes have a complex system of cytoskeletal structures that provide support, shape, and movement to the cell. These structures include microtubules, microfilaments, and intermediate filaments.\n\n##Cell wall\n\nEukaryotes often have a cell wall that provides additional support and protection to the cell. The cell wall is made up of a variety of materials, including cellulose, hemicellulose, and chitin.\n\n##Sexual reproduction\n\nMany eukaryotes are capable of sexual reproduction, which involves the exchange of genetic material between two individuals. This process allows for the creation of new combinations of traits and increases the genetic diversity of a population.\n\n#Evolution\n\nThe evolution of eukaryotes is still a topic of debate among scientists.\n\n##History of classification\n\nThe concept of eukaryotes as a distinct group of organisms has a long history that dates back to the 19th century. The term \"eukaryote\" was first coined in the 1920s to describe the presence of a true nucleus in certain organisms.\n\n##Phylogeny\n\nThe phylogeny of eukaryotes is complex and still not fully understood. However, most scientists agree that eukaryotes evolved from a group of prokaryotes called archaea.\n\n##Origin of eukaryotes\n\nThe origin of eukaryotes is thought to have occurred around 2 billion years ago, during a time of great change on Earth. The evolution of oxygen in the atmosphere and the development of complex ecosystems may have created the conditions necessary for the emergence of eukaryotes.\n\n##Fossils\n\nFossils of eukaryotes have been found dating back to the Neoproterozoic era, around 1 billion years ago. These fossils include impressions of single-celled organisms and simple multicellular organisms.\n\n#See also\n\n* Prokaryote\n* Archaea\n* Bacteria\n* Protist\n* Fungi\n* Plantae\n* Animalia\n\n#References\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank as per the requirements)\n\n#External links\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank as per the requirements)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Eukaryote\" following this outline:\n\n#Diversity\n#Distinguishing features\n##Nucleus\n##Biochemistry\n##Internal membranes\n##Mitochondria\n##Plastids\n##Cytoskeletal structures\n##Cell wall\n##Sexual reproduction\n#Evolution\n##History of classification\n##Phylogeny\n##Origin of eukaryotes\n##Fossils\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born in 1879, Puiu rose through the ranks of the Romanian Orthodox Church, serving as Metropolitan of Bukovina and Exarch of Transnistria before being exiled and later becoming Bishop of the Romanian Orthodox Diocese of Western Europe.\n\n#Early life and monastic career\n\nVisarion Puiu was born on January 12, 1879, in the village of Sângeru, Buzău County, Romania. His parents, Ioan and Elena, were devout Orthodox Christians who instilled in him a strong faith from an early age. Puiu's early education took place at the local primary school, after which he attended the Seminary in Buzău.\n\nIn 1901, Puiu enrolled in the Theological Faculty of the University of Bucharest, where he studied theology and was ordained as a deacon in 1904. He continued his studies at the University of Athens, earning a doctorate in theology in 1908. Upon his return to Romania, Puiu was tonsured as a monk at the Neamț Monastery and became a hieromonk.\n\nPuiu's monastic career progressed rapidly, with his appointment as abbot of the Neamț Monastery in 1911. He played an active role in the Romanian Orthodox Church, participating in various synods and conferences. In 1918, Puiu was consecrated as a bishop and became the Vicar Bishop of the Archdiocese of Iași.\n\n#Metropolitan of Bukovina\n\nIn 1935, Puiu was elected as the Metropolitan of Bukovina, a position he held until 1940. During his tenure, he worked to strengthen the Romanian Orthodox Church in the region, establishing new parishes and monasteries. Puiu also played a role in promoting Romanian culture and identity in Bukovina, which was then part of Romania.\n\nPuiu's time as Metropolitan of Bukovina was marked by significant events, including the annexation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina by the Soviet Union in 1940. The Romanian Orthodox Church in these territories was severely persecuted, with many clergy being arrested or deported.\n\n#Exarch of Transnistria\n\nIn 1942, Puiu was appointed as the Exarch of Transnistria, a region that had been occupied by Romanian forces during World War II. As Exarch, Puiu was responsible for overseeing the Romanian Orthodox Church in the region, which included many ethnic Romanians who had been deported from Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina.\n\nPuiu's tenure as Exarch of Transnistria was marked by controversy, with some accusing him of collaborating with the Romanian authorities and promoting a pro-Romanian agenda in the region. However, others saw him as a champion of Romanian culture and identity in a region that was heavily influenced by Soviet and Ukrainian forces.\n\n#Exile\n\n##Voyage to Croatia and exile in Nazi Germany\n\nIn 1944, as the Soviet Army advanced into Romania, Puiu fled to Croatia, where he was received by the Croatian Catholic Church. He later traveled to Nazi Germany, where he lived in exile until the end of World War II.\n\nPuiu's time in exile was marked by controversy, with some accusing him of collaborating with the Nazi regime. However, others saw him as a victim of circumstance, who was forced to flee his homeland due to the Soviet occupation.\n\n##Exile in Italy and trial for war crimes\n\nAfter the war, Puiu traveled to Italy, where he lived in exile until 1948. During this time, he was tried for war crimes by the Italian authorities, who accused him of collaborating with the Romanian authorities during World War II.\n\nPuiu was acquitted of the charges, but the trial had a significant impact on his reputation. Many in the Romanian Orthodox Church saw him as a tainted figure, who had collaborated with the enemy during a time of war.\n\n##Bishop of the Romanian Orthodox Diocese of Western Europe\n\nIn 1950, Puiu was appointed as the Bishop of the Romanian Orthodox Diocese of Western Europe, a position he held until his death in 1964. During his tenure, he worked to promote the Romanian Orthodox Church in Western Europe, establishing new parishes and monasteries.\n\nPuiu's time as Bishop of the Romanian Orthodox Diocese of Western Europe was marked by controversy, with some accusing him of promoting a pro-Romanian agenda in the region. However, others saw him as a champion of Romanian culture and identity in a region that was heavily influenced by Western European culture.\n\n##Final years and death\n\nPuiu's final years were marked by ill health, and he died on August 10, 1964, in Paris, France. His funeral was attended by many members of the Romanian Orthodox Church, who saw him as a complex and multifaceted figure, who had played a significant role in the ecclesiastical and political life of Romania during the mid-20th century.\n\n#Posthumous evaluation\n\nPuiu's legacy is complex and multifaceted, with some seeing him as a champion of Romanian culture and identity, while others view him as a collaborator with the enemy during a time of war. However, most agree that he played a significant role in the ecclesiastical and political life of Romania during the mid-20th century, and his legacy continues to be studied and debated by scholars today.\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is based on a variety of sources, including books, articles, and primary documents.

He is widely regarded as one of the most successful and influential monarchs in English history, known for his military conquests, administrative reforms, and establishment of parliamentary representation.\n\n#Early years, 1239–1263\n\n##Childhood and marriage\n\nEdward was born on 17 June 1239 at the Palace of Westminster, London, to King Henry III and Eleanor of Provence. He was the eldest son and heir apparent, and from an early age, he was groomed for kingship. Edward's childhood was marked by a close relationship with his parents, particularly his mother, who played a significant role in his upbringing. In 1254, Edward married Eleanor of Castile, a princess of the Kingdom of Castile, in a marriage arranged by his parents. The couple had several children, including the future King Edward II.\n\n##Early ambitions\n\nAs a young man, Edward was eager to prove himself as a military leader and gain experience in governance. In 1254, he was granted the Duchy of Gascony, a region in southwestern France, which became a key location for his future military campaigns. Edward's early ambitions were also driven by a desire to recover the territories lost by his father, particularly in Wales and Scotland.\n\n#Civil war and crusades, 1264–1273\n\n##Second Barons' War\n\nIn 1264, Edward supported his father in the Second Barons' War, a conflict between the monarchy and the nobility. The war was sparked by a group of barons who sought to limit the king's power and establish a more representative government. Edward played a key role in the war, leading the royalist forces to several victories, including the Battle of Evesham in 1265.\n\n##Crusade and accession\n\nIn 1268, Edward joined the Ninth Crusade, led by King Louis IX of France, in an attempt to retake the Holy Land from the Muslims. The crusade was unsuccessful, but it provided Edward with valuable military experience and exposure to different cultures. In 1272, Edward's father, King Henry III, died, and Edward succeeded him as king. However, he did not return to England immediately, instead choosing to continue his journey back from the crusade via Italy and France.\n\n#Early reign, 1274–1296\n\n##Conquest of Wales\n\nIn 1277, Edward launched a military campaign against Wales, which had been a thorn in the side of English monarchs for centuries. The campaign was successful, and Edward established English rule over Wales, incorporating it into the Kingdom of England. The conquest of Wales was a significant achievement for Edward, demonstrating his military prowess and ability to expand English territory.\n\n##Diplomacy and war on the Continent\n\nEdward's early reign was also marked by diplomatic efforts to secure alliances with other European powers. In 1279, he signed the Treaty of Amiens with France, which established a temporary peace between the two countries. However, Edward's relations with France deteriorated over the years, and in 1294, he launched a military campaign against France, which resulted in the capture of several key cities, including Bordeaux.\n\n##Great Cause\n\nIn 1291, Edward intervened in a succession crisis in Scotland, known as the Great Cause, which had been sparked by the death of King Alexander III of Scotland. Edward supported the claim of John Balliol, who was crowned king, but the move was opposed by many Scottish nobles, who saw Edward's intervention as an attempt to assert English dominance over Scotland.\n\n#Government and law\n\n##Character as king\n\nEdward was known for his strong personality, energy, and intelligence. He was a skilled military leader and administrator, who was able to inspire loyalty in his subjects. However, he was also known for his temper and ruthlessness, particularly in his dealings with his enemies.\n\n##Administration and the law\n\nEdward's reign was marked by significant administrative reforms, including the establishment of a centralized system of government and the creation of a professional bureaucracy. He also introduced several key laws, including the Statute of Mortmain, which restricted the power of the church, and the Statute of Quia Emptores, which established the principle of free alienation of land.\n\n##Finances and Parliament\n\nEdward's reign was also marked by significant financial challenges, including the cost of his military campaigns and the need to raise revenue to support his government. In 1295, he established the Model Parliament, which established the principle of representation and the right of the Commons to consent to taxation.\n\n##Parliament and the expulsion of the Jews\n\nIn 1290, Edward expelled the Jews from England, citing their alleged involvement in usury and other crimes. The move was widely popular among the English population, but it has been widely condemned by historians as a cruel and unjust act.\n\n##Administration in Ireland\n\nEdward's reign also saw significant developments in the administration of Ireland, including the establishment of a centralized system of government and the creation of a professional bureaucracy. However, his policies in Ireland were often marked by brutality and a disregard for the rights of the native Irish population.\n\n#Later reign, 1297–1307\n\n##Constitutional crisis\n\nIn 1297, Edward faced a constitutional crisis, sparked by opposition to his policies and his attempts to raise revenue without the consent of Parliament. The crisis was eventually resolved, but it marked a significant turning point in Edward's reign, highlighting the limitations of his power and the growing assertiveness of Parliament.\n\n##Return to Scotland\n\nIn 1298, Edward launched a military campaign against Scotland, which had been sparked by the Scottish rebellion against English rule. The campaign was successful, and Edward established English rule over Scotland, incorporating it into the Kingdom of England.\n\n##Death and burial\n\nEdward died on 7 July 1307, at Burgh-by-Sands, Cumberland, while on his way to Scotland to suppress another rebellion. He was buried in Westminster Abbey, where many of his predecessors had been buried.\n\n#Legacy\n\nEdward's legacy is complex and multifaceted. He is widely regarded as one of the most successful and influential monarchs in English history, known for his military conquests, administrative reforms, and establishment of parliamentary representation. However, his policies in Wales, Scotland, and Ireland have been widely criticized for their brutality and disregard for the rights of the native populations.\n\n#Family\n\n##First marriage\n\nEdward's first marriage was to Eleanor of Castile, a princess of the Kingdom of Castile. The couple had several children, including the future King Edward II.\n\n##Second marriage\n\nEdward's second marriage was to Margaret of France, a princess of the Kingdom of France. The couple had several children, but none of them survived to adulthood.\n\n##Genealogical table\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| John of England |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Henry III of England |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Edward I of England |  | Eleanor of Castile |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Edward II of England |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n#See also\n\n* List of English monarchs\n* House of Plantagenet\n* Wars of Scottish Independence\n* Conquest of Wales\n* Parliament of England\n* Edwardian era\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is a general overview of the life and reign of Edward I of England.

The election was the ninth parliamentary election since the end of communism in Hungary and the first to be held under a new electoral law.\n\n#Background\n\nThe 2022 parliamentary election took place amidst significant changes in the Hungarian electoral landscape.\n\n##Amendment of the electoral law\n\nIn 2020, the Hungarian parliament passed a significant amendment to the electoral law, which introduced a mixed electoral system, combining elements of single-member districts and proportional representation. The amendment also increased the number of seats in the National Assembly from 199 to 201. The opposition parties criticized the amendment, arguing that it would favor the ruling Fidesz-KDNP coalition.\n\n##Creation of joint opposition list\n\nIn response to the amendment, six opposition parties - the Democratic Coalition, Jobbik, LMP - Hungary's Green Party, Momentum Movement, MSZP, and Dialogue - The Greens' Party - formed a joint list to contest the election. The joint list was seen as a strategic move to maximize the opposition's chances of winning.\n\n##Opposition primary\n\nTo select the joint list's candidates, the opposition parties organized a primary election in the fall of 2021. The primary was seen as a way to engage voters and create a sense of ownership among the opposition's supporters. Péter Márki-Zay, the mayor of Hódmezővásárhely, won the primary and became the joint list's candidate for prime minister.\n\n#Electoral system\n\nThe 2022 parliamentary election used a mixed electoral system. Voters cast two ballots: one for a single-member district and one for a national party list. The single-member districts elected 106 members, while the national party list elected 95 members. The electoral threshold for the national party list was 5%.\n\n#Parties and coalitions\n\nSeveral parties and coalitions contested the election. The most significant contenders were:\n\n* Fidesz-KDNP coalition, led by Prime Minister Viktor Orbán\n* United for Hungary (the joint opposition list), led by Péter Márki-Zay\n* Our Homeland Movement, a far-right party\n* Solution Movement, a new party founded by Péter Újházi\n\n#Opinion polls\n\nOpinion polls conducted before the election showed a close contest between the Fidesz-KDNP coalition and the United for Hungary joint list. However, the polls also indicated a significant number of undecided voters, which made it difficult to predict the outcome.\n\n#Results\n\nThe election took place on April 3, 2022. The results were as follows:\n\n##Result by constituency\n\nFidesz-KDNP won 88 single-member districts, while the United for Hungary joint list won 18 districts.\n\n##Party list results by county and in the diaspora\n\nFidesz-KDNP won the majority of the party list votes in all counties, except for Budapest, where the United for Hungary joint list won. In the diaspora, Fidesz-KDNP won 95.5% of the votes.\n\n#Aftermath\n\nThe election results were seen as a decisive victory for the Fidesz-KDNP coalition, which won its fourth consecutive term in office. The opposition parties conceded defeat, but some questioned the election's legitimacy.\n\n##Analysis\n\nThe election result was seen as a reflection of the divided Hungarian society. Fidesz-KDNP's victory was attributed to its effective campaigning, as well as the opposition's failure to present a unified and coherent message.\n\n##Conduct\n\nThe election was generally considered to be free and fair, but some observers noted concerns about the voting process. The opposition parties alleged that the ruling party had used its resources to influence the outcome.\n\n##Anomalies over postal ballots\n\nThere were reports of anomalies related to postal ballots, particularly in the diaspora. Some voters reported receiving multiple ballots, while others claimed that their ballots had been tampered with.\n\n##International responses\n\nThe international community generally recognized the election result, but some countries and organizations expressed concerns about the election's conduct. The European Union's observer mission noted that the election had taken place in a \"partially free and partially fair\" environment.\n\n#See also\n\n* 2022 Hungarian local elections\n* 2018 Hungarian parliamentary election\n* Politics of Hungary\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is based on information available up to April 10, 2022.\n\n#References\n\nThis article does not include any references.\n\n#External links\n\n* National Election Office of Hungary\n* European Union's observer mission report", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Hungarian_parliamentary_election\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Amendment of the electoral law\n##Creation of joint opposition list\n##Opposition primary\n#Electoral system\n#Parties and coalitions\n#Opinion polls\n#Results\n##Result by constituency\n##Party list results by county and in the diaspora\n#Aftermath\n##Analysis\n##Conduct\n##Anomalies over postal ballots\n##International responses\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Open access publishing models, such as article processing charges (APCs), have emerged as an alternative to traditional subscription-based models.\n\n### From Readers to Authors: Hybrid and Full Open Access\n\nThe shift towards open access publishing has led to a change in the business model of scientific publishing. Traditional subscription-based models have given way to hybrid models, where authors pay APCs to make their articles open access. Full open access models, where all articles are made open access, have also emerged.\n\n### From Publishing to Analytics: Diversification of Revenue Streams\n\nThe diversification of revenue streams in scientific publishing has led to the emergence of new business models. Analytics and data services have become an important revenue stream for publishers, as researchers and institutions seek to measure the impact and quality of research.\n\n## Open Science Commons\n\nThe concept of open science commons refers to the shared knowledge and resources that are available to all members of the scientific community.\n\n### The Emergence of Digital Knowledge Commons\n\nThe emergence of digital technologies has led to the creation of digital knowledge commons, where researchers can share and access knowledge and resources. Open access repositories, data sharing platforms, and collaborative research environments have become essential tools for researchers.\n\n### Enclosures of Open Science Commons\n\nThe open science commons are not without challenges. The enclosure of open science commons, where knowledge and resources are restricted or privatized, can limit access to knowledge and hinder collaboration.\n\n### Consolidation of the Common Ecosystem (2015-)\n\nThe consolidation of the common ecosystem has led to the emergence of new players and business models. The growth of open access publishing, data sharing, and analytics has led to the creation of new opportunities and challenges for researchers, publishers, and policymakers.\n\n# Cost\n\nThe costs of open science are complex and multifaceted, involving various stakeholders and activities.\n\n## Editorial Work and Evaluation\n\nThe costs of editorial work and evaluation are significant in scientific publishing. The peer review process, where experts review and evaluate research articles, is a critical component of scientific publishing.\n\n## Technical Infrastructure\n\nThe costs of technical infrastructure, including hardware, software, and maintenance, are essential for supporting open science practices. The development and maintenance of open access repositories, data sharing platforms, and collaborative research environments require significant investment.\n\n## Commercial Services and Prestige\n\nThe costs of commercial services and prestige, including marketing, branding, and reputation, are also significant in scientific publishing. Publishers and research institutions invest heavily in promoting their brands and reputation.\n\n# Benefits\n\nThe benefits of open science are numerous and well-documented, including reduced transaction costs, access costs, and increased research efficiency.\n\n## Transaction Costs\n\nThe transaction costs of open science, including the costs of searching, accessing, and sharing knowledge, are significantly reduced. Open access publishing and data sharing platforms have made it easier for researchers to access and share knowledge.\n\n## Access Costs\n\nThe access costs of open science, including the costs of accessing research articles and data, are significantly reduced. Open access publishing and data sharing have made it possible for researchers to access knowledge without restrictions.\n\n## Research Efficiency\n\nThe research efficiency of open science is significantly improved, as researchers can build on each other's work more easily. Open science practices, such as open data and open research methods, have made it possible for researchers to collaborate more effectively.\n\n## Economic and Social Development\n\nThe economic and social development benefits of open science are significant, as open science practices can lead to the creation of new knowledge, innovations, and economic growth. Open science can also lead to improved health outcomes, environmental sustainability, and social justice.\n\n# Economic Regulation of Open Science\n\nThe economic regulation of open science is complex and multifaceted, involving various stakeholders and activities.\n\nThe regulation of open science involves the development of policies, laws, and regulations that support open science practices. Governments, research institutions, and publishers play a critical role in promoting open science practices and ensuring that the benefits of open science are realized.\n\nIn conclusion, the economics of open science is a complex and multifaceted field that involves various stakeholders and activities. Understanding the economic models, costs, benefits, and regulation of open science is essential for promoting open science practices and realizing the benefits of open science.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Economics_of_open_science\" following this outline:\n\n#Economic models\n##Open science club\n###Definitions of knowledge club\n###Knowledge club and open science\n##Open Science market\n###Scientific publishing: a hybrid market\n###From readers to authors: hybrid and full open access\n###From publishing to analytics: diversification of revenue streams\n##Open Science Commons\n###The emergence of digital knowledge commons\n###Enclosures of open science commons\n###Consolidation of the common ecosystem (2015-)\n#Cost\n##Editorial work and evaluation\n##Technical infrastructure\n##Commercial services and prestige\n#Benefits\n##Transaction costs\n##Access costs\n##Research efficiency\n##Economic and social development\n#Economic regulation of open science\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He was particularly known for his candid and often critical assessments of the Russian military's performance, which resonated with a wide audience. Tatarsky's rise to prominence was largely facilitated by his Telegram channel, where he shared updates, analysis, and opinions on the conflict. His influence extended beyond the online sphere, with many regarding him as a authoritative voice on the war.\n\n# Prison and war\n\nTatarsky's life before his blogging career is not well-documented, but it is known that he served time in prison. The exact nature and duration of his imprisonment are unclear, but it is reported that he was convicted of serious crimes. Tatarsky's experiences during this period likely shaped his worldview and informed his subsequent commentary on the war.\n\nTatarsky's involvement in the Russo-Ukrainian War began in 2014, when he started sharing updates and analysis on social media platforms. His early commentary focused on the conflict in eastern Ukraine, where Russian-backed separatists clashed with Ukrainian government forces. As the war escalated, Tatarsky's following grew, and he became known for his frank assessments of the Russian military's performance.\n\n# Telegram channel\n\nTatarsky's Telegram channel, which was launched in 2019, quickly gained a large following. The channel became a platform for him to share updates, analysis, and opinions on the war, as well as to engage with his audience. Tatarsky's commentary was often critical of the Russian military's tactics and strategies, which resonated with many readers who felt that the official narrative was overly sanitized.\n\nThe channel's popularity was fueled by Tatarsky's willingness to challenge the official narrative and provide candid assessments of the war. He frequently criticized the Russian military's leadership, highlighting what he saw as incompetence and corruption. Tatarsky's commentary also extended to the Ukrainian side, where he praised the country's military for its resilience and adaptability.\n\n## Censorship and criticism\n\nTatarsky's Telegram channel was not without controversy. He faced criticism from some quarters for his perceived bias against the Russian military, with some accusing him of being a Ukrainian agent or a Western propagandist. Tatarsky denied these allegations, maintaining that his goal was to provide accurate and unbiased information about the war.\n\nThe Russian authorities also took notice of Tatarsky's channel, with some reports suggesting that he was subjected to censorship and harassment. Tatarsky claimed that his channel was repeatedly blocked by Russian authorities, who sought to silence his criticism of the military. Despite these challenges, the channel remained popular, with many readers continuing to follow Tatarsky's commentary.\n\n# Assassination\n\nOn April 2, 2023, Tatarsky was assassinated in a bombing at a St. Petersburg cafe. The attack, which was claimed by Ukrainian nationalists, marked a shocking escalation of violence against Russian commentators. Tatarsky's death was widely condemned, with many regarding it as a targeted killing designed to silence his criticism of the Russian military.\n\nThe aftermath of Tatarsky's assassination saw a significant outpouring of grief and outrage, with many commentators and bloggers paying tribute to his memory. The Russian authorities launched an investigation into the attack, which was widely seen as a terrorist act.\n\n## Investigation and aftermath\n\nThe investigation into Tatarsky's assassination is ongoing, but it is clear that the attack was carefully planned and executed. The Ukrainian nationalists who claimed responsibility for the bombing cited Tatarsky's commentary as a motivation for the attack, arguing that he had been a vocal supporter of the Russian military.\n\nThe Russian authorities have vowed to bring those responsible for Tatarsky's assassination to justice, but the incident has raised concerns about the safety of commentators and bloggers who cover the war. Many have called for greater protection for those who risk their lives to provide information and analysis about the conflict.\n\n# Legacy\n\nTatarsky's legacy is complex and multifaceted. He was a polarizing figure who inspired both admiration and criticism, but his influence on the public discourse about the war is undeniable. Tatarsky's commentary provided a unique perspective on the conflict, one that was often at odds with the official narrative.\n\nTatarsky's assassination has also raised important questions about the safety of commentators and bloggers who cover the war. His death serves as a reminder of the risks that many take to provide information and analysis about the conflict, and it has highlighted the need for greater protection and support for those who engage in this critical work.\n\n# See also\n\n* Russo-Ukrainian War\n* Russian military\n* Ukrainian military\n* Telegram\n* Censorship in Russia\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is based on publicly available information and does not reflect the views or opinions of any individual or organization.\n\n# References\n\nNone\n\n# External links\n\n* Tatarsky's Telegram channel ( archived)\n* Coverage of Tatarsky's assassination on BBC News\n* Coverage of Tatarsky's assassination on The New York Times", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Vladlen_Tatarsky\" following this outline:\n\n#Prison and war\n#Telegram channel\n#Assassination\n#Legacy\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The storm system was particularly notable for its unusual combination of winter and severe weather, which affected a vast area stretching from the southern United States to the Canadian Prairies.\n\n# Meteorological synopsis\n\nThe storm complex developed on April 10, 2022, as a potent low-pressure system formed over the Rocky Mountains. The system rapidly intensified as it moved eastward, driven by a strong jet stream and a deepening trough. As the system interacted with a cold front, it produced a complex mix of winter and severe weather. The storm system's unusual trajectory and timing allowed it to tap into a rich source of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, leading to the development of severe thunderstorms and tornadoes across the southern United States.\n\n# Confirmed tornadoes\n\nThe April 2022 North American storm complex produced a significant number of tornadoes across the southern United States. According to the National Weather Service, a total of 43 tornadoes were confirmed during the event, with the majority occurring on April 11 and 12.\n\n## April 11 event\n\nOn April 11, a total of 17 tornadoes were confirmed across the states of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Missouri. The strongest tornado of the day occurred in the town of Jacksboro, Texas, where a EF3 tornado caused significant damage and injured several people.\n\n## April 12 event\n\nOn April 12, a total of 15 tornadoes were confirmed across the states of Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. The strongest tornado of the day occurred in the town of Monroe, Louisiana, where a EF2 tornado caused significant damage and injured several people.\n\n## April 13 event\n\nOn April 13, a total of 5 tornadoes were confirmed across the states of Alabama and Georgia. The strongest tornado of the day occurred in the town of Opelika, Alabama, where a EF1 tornado caused significant damage and injured several people.\n\n## Bell County–Salado, Texas\n\nA rare anticyclonic tornado occurred on April 12 in Bell County, Texas, near the town of Salado. The tornado was classified as an EF2 and caused significant damage to several homes and businesses.\n\n# Non-tornadic effects\n\nIn addition to the tornadoes, the April 2022 North American storm complex produced a wide range of non-tornadic severe weather effects, including severe thunderstorms, freezing temperatures, and blizzard conditions.\n\n## Severe storms\n\nSevere thunderstorms developed across a large area of the southern United States, producing large hail, damaging winds, and isolated tornadoes. The storms caused significant damage and disruptions, particularly in the states of Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas.\n\n## Winter weather side\n\nAs the storm system moved northward, it produced a significant winter weather event across the Canadian Prairies and the northern United States. Freezing temperatures and blizzard conditions affected a vast area, causing significant disruptions and damage.\n\n### Freezing temperatures\n\nFreezing temperatures affected a large area of the Canadian Prairies and the northern United States, causing significant damage to crops and infrastructure. Temperatures plummeted as low as -20°C in some areas, making it one of the coldest April events on record.\n\n### Blizzard\n\nA significant blizzard developed across the Canadian Prairies, producing heavy snowfall and high winds. The blizzard caused significant disruptions and damage, particularly in the provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Drifts reached as high as 2 meters in some areas, making it difficult for emergency responders to reach affected areas.\n\n# Impact\n\nThe April 2022 North American storm complex had a significant impact on the affected regions, causing widespread damage and disruptions. The storm system caused an estimated $1 billion in damages, making it one of the costliest April storm events on record.\n\nThe storm system also had a significant impact on agriculture, particularly in the Canadian Prairies. The freezing temperatures and blizzard conditions caused significant damage to crops, leading to a shortage of certain agricultural products.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of North American tornadoes and tornado outbreaks\n* List of Canadian tornadoes and tornado outbreaks\n* Severe thunderstorm\n* Blizzard\n* Freezing rain\n* Ice storm\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a general overview of the April 2022 North American storm complex.

He decides to retire from his adventures and live a quiet life with Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek). However, his plans are disrupted by the arrival of a wolf (Wagner Moura), who is determined to kill Puss and claim his last life.\n\nPuss soon discovers that the wolf is working for a dark force that threatens the land.

Together, they embark on a perilous journey to find the Last Wish, a mystical entity that can grant any wish.\n\nAlong the way, they encounter various obstacles, including treacherous landscapes, fierce creatures, and rival treasure hunters.

However, the project faced several delays due to various reasons, including the box office performance of other DreamWorks films.\n\nIn 2018, the studio announced that the sequel was back in development, with Bob Persichetti set to direct.

The film's visual style was inspired by the works of Gustav Klimt and Egon Schiele, with intricate details and ornate patterns.\n\nThe character designs were created by Christophe Lautrette, who had previously worked on the first Puss in Boots film. Lautrette's designs aimed to capture the essence of each character, with Puss being the most iconic and recognizable.\n\nAnalysis\n----------\n\nPuss in Boots: The Last Wish explores several themes, including mortality, friendship, and the power of love. The film's narrative is layered with symbolism and metaphors, adding depth and complexity to the story.\n\nThe character of Puss in Boots is a metaphor for the human experience, with his nine lives representing the fragility and preciousness of life. His journey is a reflection of our own struggles and fears, as we navigate the challenges of growing older and facing our own mortality.\n\nThe film's use of fairy tale and mythology elements adds a rich layer of meaning to the story. The character of the Wolf, for example, represents the unknown and the fears that we all face.\n\nMusic\n------\n\nThe score for Puss in Boots: The Last Wish was composed by Heitor Pereira. The soundtrack features a mix of Latin American music, folk, and orchestral elements, reflecting the film's cultural and geographical influences.\n\nThe film's soundtrack also features several original songs, including \"Fearless Heroes\" and \"Por el resto de mi vida\".

Anti-Zionism encompasses a wide range of perspectives and motivations, and has been expressed by individuals and groups from various backgrounds, including Jewish, Arab, and international communities. This article will explore the history and development of anti-Zionism from the early 20th century to the present day.\n\n# Anti-Zionism before 1948\n## Early Jewish anti-Zionism\n\nJewish opposition to Zionism dates back to the early days of the movement. Some Jewish leaders and intellectuals saw Zionism as a threat to Jewish integration and assimilation in their countries of residence. Others were concerned about the potential for Zionism to exacerbate anti-Semitism, or to create a new form of Jewish nationalism that would undermine traditional Jewish values. Early Jewish anti-Zionists included prominent figures such as the German-Jewish philosopher Hermann Cohen, who argued that Zionism was incompatible with Jewish universalism and humanism.\n\n## Early Arab anti-Zionism\n\nArab opposition to Zionism emerged in the early 20th century, as the Zionist movement began to gain momentum. Arab leaders and intellectuals saw Zionism as a threat to Arab national aspirations and territorial integrity. They were concerned about the potential for Jewish immigration to displace Arab populations and undermine Arab control over the region. Early Arab anti-Zionists included figures such as the Syrian writer and politician, Rashid Khalidi, who argued that Zionism was a form of colonialism that would undermine Arab rights and interests.\n\n## Reactions to the Balfour Declaration\n\nThe 1917 Balfour Declaration, in which the British government expressed support for the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine, sparked widespread opposition from both Jewish and Arab communities. Jewish anti-Zionists saw the Declaration as a betrayal of Jewish interests and a threat to Jewish integration in Britain and other countries. Arab anti-Zionists saw the Declaration as a form of colonialism and a threat to Arab national aspirations.\n\n## Anti-Zionism in the 1920s–1930s\n\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, anti-Zionism became increasingly widespread, particularly in the Arab world. The rise of Arab nationalism and the growth of anti-colonial movements contributed to a growing sense of opposition to Zionism. Jewish anti-Zionists, meanwhile, continued to argue that Zionism was a threat to Jewish integration and assimilation, and that it would exacerbate anti-Semitism.\n\n## The Biltmore programme and its anti-Zionism fall-out\n\nIn 1942, the Zionist movement adopted the Biltmore programme, which called for the establishment of a Jewish commonwealth in Palestine. The programme sparked widespread opposition from both Jewish and Arab communities. Jewish anti-Zionists saw the programme as a threat to Jewish interests and a form of extremism. Arab anti-Zionists saw the programme as a form of colonialism and a threat to Arab national aspirations.\n\n## Religious\n\nReligious opposition to Zionism has been expressed by both Jewish and non-Jewish communities. Some Jewish anti-Zionists have argued that Zionism is incompatible with traditional Jewish values and that it represents a form of idolatry. Non-Jewish anti-Zionists have argued that Zionism is a form of colonialism and that it undermines the rights and interests of indigenous populations.\n\n# Anti-Zionism after World War II and the creation of Israel\n## 1947–1948\n\nIn the aftermath of World War II, anti-Zionism became increasingly widespread, particularly in the Arab world. The 1947 UN Partition Plan, which called for the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine, sparked widespread opposition from Arab leaders and intellectuals. The plan was seen as a form of colonialism and a threat to Arab national aspirations.\n\n## Soviet Union\n\nThe Soviet Union was a key player in the early years of the Cold War, and its position on Zionism was shaped by its anti-imperialist and anti-colonial stance. The Soviet Union saw Zionism as a form of colonialism and a threat to Arab national aspirations. Soviet anti-Zionism was also driven by a desire to undermine Western influence in the region.\n\n## Arab and Palestinian anti-Zionism\n\nArab and Palestinian opposition to Zionism has been driven by a range of factors, including a desire to protect Arab national aspirations and territorial integrity. Arab and Palestinian anti-Zionists have argued that Zionism is a form of colonialism and that it undermines the rights and interests of indigenous populations.\n\n## Perception of Zionism as racism\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, anti-Zionism became increasingly linked to the perception of Zionism as racism. The 1975 UN General Assembly resolution, which equated Zionism with racism, was a key moment in this process. Arab and Palestinian anti-Zionists argued that Zionism was a form of racism and that it undermined the rights and interests of indigenous populations.\n\n### During the Cold War\n\nDuring the Cold War, anti-Zionism became increasingly polarized, with the Soviet Union and its allies arguing that Zionism was a form of colonialism and imperialism. The United States and its allies, meanwhile, argued that Zionism was a legitimate form of nationalism.\n\n### After the Cold War\n\nIn the aftermath of the Cold War, anti-Zionism has continued to evolve, with new forms of opposition emerging. The rise of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement has been a key moment in this process, with BDS activists arguing that Zionism is a form of apartheid and that it undermines the rights and interests of indigenous populations.\n\n## Islamic perspectives\n\nIslamic perspectives on Zionism have been shaped by a range of factors, including a desire to protect Muslim holy sites and to promote Islamic values. Islamic anti-Zionists have argued that Zionism is a form of colonialism and that it undermines the rights and interests of indigenous populations.\n\n## Left-wing politics\n\nLeft-wing opposition to Zionism has been driven by a range of factors, including a desire to promote anti-colonialism and anti-imperialism. Left-wing anti-Zionists have argued that Zionism is a form of colonialism and that it undermines the rights and interests of indigenous populations.\n\n## Christian anti-Zionism\n\nChristian opposition to Zionism has been driven by a range of factors, including a desire to promote Christian values and to protect Christian holy sites. Christian anti-Zionists have argued that Zionism is a form of colonialism and that it undermines the rights and interests of indigenous populations.\n\n### Protestants\n\nProtestant opposition to Zionism has been driven by a range of factors, including a desire to promote Christian values and to protect Christian holy sites. Protestant anti-Zionists have argued that Zionism is a form of colonialism and that it undermines the rights and interests of indigenous populations.\n\n### Catholics\n\nCatholic opposition to Zionism has been driven by a range of factors, including a desire to promote Christian values and to protect Christian holy sites. Catholic anti-Zionists have argued that Zionism is a form of colonialism and that it undermines the rights and interests of indigenous populations.\n\n## Haredi Judaism\n\nHaredi Jewish opposition to Zionism has been driven by a range of factors, including a desire to promote traditional Jewish values and to protect Jewish holy sites. Haredi anti-Zionists have argued that Zionism is a form of idolatry and that it undermines traditional Jewish values.\n\n# Allegations of antisemitism\n## Jewish right to a state\n\nThe question of whether anti-Zionism is a form of antisemitism is a highly contested issue. Some argue that anti-Zionism is a legitimate form of opposition to Israeli policies and that it does not necessarily involve antisemitism. Others argue that anti-Zionism is often used as a cover for antisemitism and that it undermines the Jewish right to a state.\n\n## Equating and correlating anti-Zionism with antisemitism\n\nSome scholars and politicians have argued that anti-Zionism is often correlated with antisemitism and that it can be used as a form of antisemitic discourse. They argue that anti-Zionism often involves the demonization of Israel and the Jewish people, and that it can be used to promote antisemitic stereotypes and conspiracy theories.\n\n## View that the two are not interlinked\n\nOthers argue that anti-Zionism and antisemitism are not necessarily interlinked and that it is possible to oppose Zionism without being antisemitic. They argue that anti-Zionism can be a legitimate form of opposition to Israeli policies and that it does not necessarily involve antisemitism.\n\n## Shifting positions on the Zionist/Anti-Zionist spectrum\n\nThe position of individuals and groups on the Zionist/anti-Zionist spectrum can shift over time, and some may move from one end of the spectrum to the other. This can be due to a range of factors, including changes in personal circumstances, exposure to new ideas and experiences, and shifts in the political and social context.\n\n## Far-right politics\n\nFar-right politics has often been linked to antisemitism, and some far-right groups have used anti-Zionism as a cover for their antisemitic views. However, not all anti-Zionists are far-right, and many anti-Zionists are motivated by a desire to promote anti-colonialism and anti-imperialism.\n\n## Conspiracy theories\n\nConspiracy theories have often been used to promote antisemitic views, and some anti-Zionists have been accused of promoting conspiracy theories about Israel and the Jewish people. However, not all anti-Zionists promote conspiracy theories, and many are motivated by a desire to promote critical thinking and skepticism.\n\n# See also\n* Zionism\n* Anti-Semitism\n* Israeli-Palestinian conflict\n* Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions\n* Arab-Israeli conflict\n* Jewish nationalism\n* Arab nationalism\n\n# Notes\n\n# Sources\n\n# External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Anti-Zionism\" following this outline:\n\n#Anti-Zionism before 1948\n##Early Jewish anti-Zionism\n##Early Arab anti-Zionism\n##Reactions to the Balfour Declaration\n##Anti-Zionism in the 1920s–1930s\n##The Biltmore programme and its anti-Zionism fall-out\n##Religious\n#Anti-Zionism after World War II and the creation of Israel\n##1947–1948\n##Soviet Union\n##Arab and Palestinian anti-Zionism\n##Perception of Zionism as racism\n###During the Cold War\n###After the Cold War\n##Islamic perspectives\n##Left-wing politics\n##Christian anti-Zionism\n###Protestants\n###Catholics\n##Haredi Judaism\n#Allegations of antisemitism\n##Jewish right to a state\n##Equating and correlating anti-Zionism with antisemitism\n##View that the two are not interlinked\n##Shifting positions on the Zionist/Anti-Zionist spectrum\n##Far-right politics\n##Conspiracy theories\n#See also\n#Notes\n##Citations\n#Sources\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born and raised in Russia, Ovsyannikova worked as a producer and editor for several Russian media outlets before becoming a prominent voice of dissent against the Kremlin's policies.\n\n# Early life and career\n\nMarina Ovsyannikova was born on June 19, 1978, in Odessa, Ukraine, which was then part of the Soviet Union. She grew up in a family of intellectuals and developed an interest in journalism from an early age. After completing her education, Ovsyannikova began her career in journalism, working as a producer and editor for several Russian media outlets, including the state-controlled Channel One.\n\nDuring her time at Channel One, Ovsyannikova worked on various news programs and developed a reputation as a skilled and dedicated journalist. However, she became increasingly disillusioned with the Kremlin's control over the media and the lack of editorial freedom. In 2022, Ovsyannikova made the bold decision to speak out against the Russian government's actions in Ukraine, which would change the course of her life forever.\n\n# Anti-war protests\n\n## Pre-recorded message\n\nOn March 14, 2022, Ovsyannikova appeared on a live broadcast of Channel One's Vremya news program, holding a sign that read \"No War\" in English and \"Stop the War, Don't Believe the Propaganda\" in Russian. During the broadcast, she interrupted the news anchor and shouted \"Stop the war! No to war!\" before being quickly escorted off the set.\n\nHowever, what many viewers did not realize at the time was that Ovsyannikova had also pre-recorded a video message that would be released on social media after her protest. In the video, she explained her reasons for speaking out against the war and criticized the Kremlin's control over the media. The video quickly went viral, and Ovsyannikova became an overnight sensation, hailed as a hero by many for her bravery.\n\n## Reactions\n\nOvsyannikova's protest sparked a mixture of reactions, both within Russia and internationally. Many people praised her for her courage and conviction, while others criticized her for her actions. The Russian government was quick to condemn Ovsyannikova's protest, with the Kremlin's spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, describing her actions as \"hooliganism.\"\n\nHowever, Ovsyannikova's protest also inspired a wave of anti-war activism within Russia, with many people taking to social media to express their opposition to the war. The hashtag #NoToWar became a rallying cry for many Russians, and Ovsyannikova's name became synonymous with resistance against the Kremlin.\n\n## Persecutions and activism\n\nAfter her protest, Ovsyannikova faced persecution from the Russian authorities. She was arrested and charged with \"discrediting the Russian armed forces,\" a crime that carries a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison. However, Ovsyannikova refused to be silenced, and she continued to speak out against the war, even from behind bars.\n\nIn the months that followed, Ovsyannikova became a prominent voice in the anti-war movement, using her platform to raise awareness about the human cost of the conflict. She spoke to international media outlets, wrote articles, and even appeared in a documentary about the war. Despite the risks, Ovsyannikova remained committed to her cause, inspiring countless others to join her in speaking out against the war.\n\n## Criticism\n\nHowever, not everyone was supportive of Ovsyannikova's actions. Some critics argued that her protest was a publicity stunt, designed to draw attention to herself rather than the cause. Others criticized her for being naive, arguing that her actions would not bring about real change.\n\nAdditionally, some people questioned Ovsyannikova's motives, suggesting that she was motivated by personal gain rather than a genuine desire to bring about peace. However, Ovsyannikova's supporters argued that her actions were a courageous stand against a powerful and oppressive regime, and that she should be commended for her bravery.\n\n# Personal life\n\nDespite the challenges she has faced, Ovsyannikova remains committed to her cause. She continues to speak out against the war, even in the face of persecution and criticism. Ovsyannikova's personal life has been affected by her activism, and she has faced difficulties in her relationships and career. However, she remains resolute, believing that her actions are necessary to bring about change.\n\nOvsyannikova is married with two children, and she has expressed concern about the impact of her activism on her family. However, she has also stated that she cannot remain silent in the face of injustice, and that she will continue to speak out against the war, no matter the cost.\n\n# See also\n\n* Russian anti-war movement\n* Kremlin's control over the media\n* Anti-war activism in Russia\n* Marina Ovsyannikova's interview with BBC\n* Marina Ovsyannikova's article in The Guardian\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a comprehensive overview of Marina Ovsyannikova's life and activism.

The DPR and LPR declared independence from Ukraine in 2014, following a period of unrest and the annexation of Crimea by Russia. The recognition of these states has been a contentious issue in international relations, with some countries recognizing them as sovereign states and others not.\n\n#History\n\nThe Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic were declared in April 2014, following a period of protests and unrest in eastern Ukraine. The regions had strong economic and cultural ties to Russia, and many residents spoke Russian as their primary language. The Ukrainian government, led by President Petro Poroshenko, saw the declarations of independence as a threat to the country's territorial integrity and responded with military force. The conflict between Ukrainian government forces and separatist militias escalated into a full-scale war, with thousands of people killed and millions displaced.\n\nIn 2022, Russia recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states, following a period of increased tensions with Ukraine and the West. The recognition was met with widespread international condemnation, with many countries viewing it as a violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\n#Aftermath of Russian recognition\n\nFollowing Russia's recognition of the DPR and LPR, several countries imposed economic sanctions on Russia, including the United States, the European Union, and the United Kingdom. The sanctions targeted Russian banks, energy companies, and individuals close to President Vladimir Putin. Russia responded by imposing its own sanctions on Western countries, including a ban on food imports.\n\nThe recognition of the DPR and LPR also led to a deterioration in relations between Russia and Ukraine. Ukraine severed diplomatic ties with Russia and imposed its own sanctions on Russian companies and individuals. The conflict between Ukrainian government forces and separatist militias continued, with periodic outbreaks of violence.\n\n#Countries and entities that recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states\n\n##UN member states\n\nAs of 2022, only one UN member state, Russia, has recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states. Russia's recognition was met with widespread international condemnation, with many countries viewing it as a violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\n##Non-UN states\n\nSeveral non-UN states have recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states, including:\n\n* Abkhazia: A breakaway region of Georgia, Abkhazia has recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states since 2014.\n* Artsakh: A breakaway region of Azerbaijan, Artsakh has recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states since 2014.\n* South Ossetia: A breakaway region of Georgia, South Ossetia has recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states since 2014.\n* Transnistria: A breakaway region of Moldova, Transnistria has recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states since 2014.\n\n#Positions by other countries\n\n##Countries and entities that supported recognizing the DPR and LPR as independent states\n\n###UN member states\n\nSeveral UN member states have expressed support for recognizing the DPR and LPR as independent states, including:\n\n* Belarus: Belarus has expressed support for recognizing the DPR and LPR as independent states, but has not formally recognized them.\n* Cuba: Cuba has expressed support for recognizing the DPR and LPR as independent states, but has not formally recognized them.\n* Nicaragua: Nicaragua has expressed support for recognizing the DPR and LPR as independent states, but has not formally recognized them.\n* Syria: Syria has expressed support for recognizing the DPR and LPR as independent states, but has not formally recognized them.\n\n##Countries and entities that did not support recognizing the DPR and LPR as independent states\n\n###UN member states\n\nThe majority of UN member states have not supported recognizing the DPR and LPR as independent states. Many countries have expressed support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and have called for a peaceful resolution to the conflict.\n\n###Non-UN states\n\nSeveral non-UN states have not supported recognizing the DPR and LPR as independent states, including:\n\n* Kosovo: Kosovo has expressed support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and has not recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states.\n* Taiwan: Taiwan has expressed support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and has not recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states.\n\n###International and regional organizations\n\nSeveral international and regional organizations have not supported recognizing the DPR and LPR as independent states, including:\n\n* European Union: The European Union has expressed support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and has not recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states.\n* NATO: NATO has expressed support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and has not recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states.\n* Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe: The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe has expressed support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and has not recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states.\n* United Nations: The United Nations has not recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states, and has expressed support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\n#See also\n\n* International recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia\n* International recognition of Kosovo\n* International recognition of the Republic of Artsakh\n* International recognition of Transnistria\n* List of states with limited recognition\n\n#Notes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"International_recognition_of_the_Donetsk_People's_Republic_and_the_Luhansk_People's_Republic\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n#Aftermath of Russian recognition\n#Countries and entities that recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states\n##UN member states\n##Non-UN states\n#Positions by other countries\n##Countries and entities that supported recognizing the DPR and LPR as independent states\n###UN member states\n##Countries and entities that did not support recognizing the DPR and LPR as independent states\n###UN member states\n###Non-UN states\n###International and regional organizations\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Rowling\n\nJoanne Kathleen Rowling, better known by her pen name J.K. Rowling, is a British novelist, screenwriter, and philanthropist best known for writing the fantasy series Harry Potter.\n\n# Name\n\nJ.K. Rowling was born Joanne Kathleen Rowling on July 31, 1965, in Yate, Gloucestershire, England. Her pen name, J.K. Rowling, is derived from her initials and her grandmother's name, Kathleen.\n\n# Life and Career\n\n## Early Life and Family\n\nRowling was born to Peter James Rowling and Anne Volant Rowling. Her father was a Rolls-Royce aircraft engineer, and her mother was a science technician. Rowling's parents met on a train from King's Cross Station in London to Argyll in Scotland.

The couple had two sons, David and Mackenzie.\n\n## Adult Fiction and Robert Galbraith\n\nIn 2013, Rowling published her first novel for adults, \"The Casual Vacancy,\" under her own name.

The play was a critical and commercial success.\n\n## Children's Stories\n\nIn 2008, Rowling published \"The Tales of Beedle the Bard,\" a collection of fairy tales from the wizarding world. The book was illustrated by Rowling herself.\n\n# Influences\n\nRowling's writing has been influenced by a range of authors, including J.R.R. Tolkien, Philip Pullman, and Jane Austen.

She has also explored themes of depression, anxiety, and mental health.\n\n# Reception\n\n## Gender and Social Division\n\nThe Harry Potter series has been praised for its portrayal of strong female characters and its exploration of social issues such as prejudice and inequality. However, some critics have argued that the series perpetuates traditional gender roles and stereotypes.\n\n## Religious Reactions\n\nThe Harry Potter series has been the subject of controversy and criticism from some religious groups, who have accused Rowling of promoting witchcraft and Satanism.

From the early days of the Russian Empire to the present day, Russian cinema has produced some of the most iconic and influential films in the world. This article provides an overview of the development of Russian cinema, from its early beginnings to the present day.\n\n#Cinema of the Russian Empire\n\nThe cinema of the Russian Empire began in the late 19th century, with the first film screenings taking place in Moscow and St. Petersburg in the 1890s. During this period, Russian filmmakers were primarily concerned with documenting everyday life and producing short, factual films. However, as the industry developed, Russian filmmakers began to experiment with narrative film, producing some of the earliest and most influential films in the world.\n\nOne of the most notable filmmakers of this period was Evgeni Bauer, who is often credited with establishing the Russian film industry. Bauer's films, such as \"The Dying Swan\" (1917) and \"The King of Paris\" (1917), were known for their technical innovation and artistic merit, and helped to establish Russia as a major player in the world of cinema.\n\n#Cinema of the Soviet Union\n\nThe Russian Revolution of 1917 marked a significant turning point in the development of Russian cinema. The new Soviet government recognized the potential of film as a tool for propaganda and education, and invested heavily in the film industry. As a result, Soviet cinema flourished, producing some of the most iconic and influential films of the 20th century.\n\n##Early Soviet cinema (1917–1953)\n\nDuring the early years of the Soviet Union, filmmakers were encouraged to produce films that promoted the ideals of socialism and communism. This period saw the emergence of some of the most influential filmmakers in Soviet history, including Sergei Eisenstein and Dziga Vertov.\n\nEisenstein's films, such as \"Battleship Potemkin\" (1925) and \"October\" (1928), are renowned for their technical innovation and artistic merit. Vertov's films, such as \"Man with a Movie Camera\" (1929), are known for their experimental style and their exploration of the possibilities of documentary film.\n\n##Late Soviet cinema (1953–1990)\n\nAfter the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953, Soviet cinema entered a new era of creative freedom. Filmmakers were able to experiment with new styles and themes, producing some of the most iconic and influential films of the late 20th century.\n\nOne of the most notable filmmakers of this period was Andrei Tarkovsky, whose films, such as \"Andrei Rublev\" (1966) and \"Solaris\" (1972), are known for their philosophical and poetic themes. Other notable filmmakers of this period include Sergei Parajanov, whose films, such as \"Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors\" (1964), are known for their technical innovation and artistic merit.\n\n#New Russian cinema\n\nWith the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russian cinema entered a new era of creative freedom and commercialization. This period has seen the emergence of a new generation of filmmakers, who have been able to experiment with new styles and themes.\n\n##1990s\n\nThe 1990s saw a significant decline in the Russian film industry, as the government withdrew funding and the market became increasingly dominated by foreign films. However, this period also saw the emergence of a new generation of filmmakers, who were able to experiment with new styles and themes.\n\nOne of the most notable filmmakers of this period was Nikita Mikhalkov, whose films, such as \"Burnt by the Sun\" (1994), are known for their technical innovation and artistic merit.\n\n##2000s\n\nThe 2000s saw a resurgence in the Russian film industry, as the government increased funding and the market became increasingly dominated by domestic films. This period saw the emergence of a new generation of filmmakers, who were able to experiment with new styles and themes.\n\nOne of the most notable filmmakers of this period was Andrei Zvyagintsev, whose films, such as \"The Return\" (2003) and \"Leviathan\" (2014), are known for their philosophical and poetic themes.\n\n##2010s\n\nThe 2010s saw a significant increase in the production of Russian films, as the government continued to increase funding and the market became increasingly dominated by domestic films. This period saw the emergence of a new generation of filmmakers, who were able to experiment with new styles and themes.\n\nOne of the most notable filmmakers of this period was Kirill Serebrennikov, whose films, such as \"The Student\" (2016), are known for their technical innovation and artistic merit.\n\n##2020s\n\nThe 2020s saw a significant decline in the Russian film industry, as the government withdrew funding and the market became increasingly dominated by foreign films. However, this period also saw the emergence of a new generation of filmmakers, who were able to experiment with new styles and themes.\n\n###2022 boycott\n\nIn 2022, the Russian film industry was subject to a boycott by several major film festivals and distributors, in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

The case involves allegations of falsifying business records in connection with a hush-money payment made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels in the final days of the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\n# Background\n\n## Stormy Daniels–Donald Trump scandal\n\nIn 2006, Donald Trump had an alleged extramarital affair with adult film actress Stormy Daniels. The affair reportedly took place at a golf resort in Lake Tahoe, California. In 2016, during Trump's presidential campaign, Daniels' story was shopped around to various media outlets, but it was not published due to concerns about the story's credibility and the potential for libel lawsuits.\n\nIn January 2018, The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, had paid Daniels $130,000 in hush money to keep the affair quiet. The payment was made through a shell company, Essential Consultants LLC, which was established by Cohen in Delaware. Trump initially denied any knowledge of the payment, but later acknowledged that he had reimbursed Cohen for the payment.\n\n## Manhattan DA investigation and grand jury\n\nIn 2019, the Manhattan District Attorney's Office (DA) launched an investigation into the hush-money payment and whether it constituted a campaign finance violation. The DA also investigated whether Trump's company, the Trump Organization, had falsified business records related to the payment.\n\nIn 2020, the DA convened a grand jury to hear evidence in the case. The grand jury subpoenaed numerous witnesses, including Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, and several employees of the Trump Organization.\n\n## Eligibility for president\n\nSome have raised questions about whether a conviction in this case could affect Trump's eligibility to serve as president in the future. However, it is generally agreed that a state-level conviction would not automatically disqualify Trump from holding federal office. Any attempt to disqualify Trump would likely require a separate proceeding in Congress.\n\n# Initial proceedings\n\n## Indictment and charges\n\nOn March 30, 2023, the Manhattan grand jury indicted Trump on 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. The indictment alleged that Trump had falsified records related to the hush-money payment to Stormy Daniels.\n\n## Arraignment\n\nTrump was arraigned on April 4, 2023, in the New York State Supreme Court. He pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\n# Pre-trial proceedings\n\n## Request for indictment dismissal\n\nIn April 2023, Trump's lawyers filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, arguing that the charges were politically motivated and that the prosecution had exceeded its jurisdiction. The motion was denied by the trial judge.\n\n## Discovery materials and witnesses\n\nIn the months leading up to trial, the prosecution and defense exchanged discovery materials, including documents, emails, and witness statements. The prosecution also disclosed a list of witnesses it intended to call at trial, including several former employees of the Trump Organization.\n\n## Requests for recusal\n\nTrump's lawyers filed several motions seeking to recuse the trial judge and other judges involved in the case, alleging bias and conflicts of interest. The motions were denied.\n\n## Request for removal to federal court\n\nIn May 2023, Trump's lawyers filed a motion to remove the case to federal court, arguing that the charges involved federal campaign finance laws and that the federal court had exclusive jurisdiction. The motion was denied.\n\n## Trial scheduling\n\nThe trial was initially scheduled to begin in June 2023, but it was later delayed to October 2023 due to pre-trial motions and discovery issues.\n\n## Gag order\n\nIn June 2023, the trial judge issued a gag order, prohibiting the parties and their lawyers from making public statements about the case.\n\n## Statute of limitations\n\nThe defense raised the issue of the statute of limitations, arguing that the charges were time-barred. However, the prosecution argued that the statute of limitations had been tolled due to Trump's alleged concealment of the hush-money payment.\n\n# Overview of witnesses\n\nThe prosecution's witness list included several former employees of the Trump Organization, as well as Stormy Daniels herself. The defense's witness list included several of Trump's current and former employees, as well as a former lawyer who had worked on Trump's behalf.\n\n# Trial\n\n## Jury selection and opening statements\n\nJury selection began on October 2, 2023, and lasted for several days. The prosecution and defense delivered their opening statements on October 10, 2023.\n\n## Contempt hearings\n\nDuring the trial, the judge held several contempt hearings to address issues of witness intimidation and misconduct.\n\n## Prosecution witnesses\n\n### David Pecker\n\nDavid Pecker, the former CEO of American Media Inc., testified about his company's involvement in the hush-money payment.\n\n### Graff, Farro, Browning, and Thompson\n\nSeveral former employees of the Trump Organization testified about their knowledge of the hush-money payment and the company's financial records.\n\n### Keith Davidson and Douglas Daus\n\nKeith Davidson, Stormy Daniels' former lawyer, testified about his role in negotiating the hush-money payment. Douglas Daus, a former employee of the Trump Organization, testified about his knowledge of the company's financial records.\n\n### Hope Hicks\n\nHope Hicks, Trump's former communications director, testified about her knowledge of the hush-money payment and the company's financial records.\n\n### McConney, Tarasoff, and Franklin\n\nSeveral former employees of the Trump Organization testified about their knowledge of the company's financial records and the hush-money payment.\n\n### Stormy Daniels\n\nStormy Daniels testified about her alleged affair with Trump and the hush-money payment.\n\n### Manochio, Menzies, and Westerhout\n\nSeveral former employees of the Trump Organization testified about their knowledge of the company's financial records and the hush-money payment.\n\n### Dixon, Tomalin, Longstreet, and Jarmel-Schneider\n\nSeveral former employees of the Trump Organization testified about their knowledge of the company's financial records and the hush-money payment.\n\n### Michael Cohen\n\nMichael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer, testified about his role in negotiating the hush-money payment and the company's financial records.\n\n## Defense witnesses\n\n### Daniel Sitko\n\nDaniel Sitko, a former employee of the Trump Organization, testified about his knowledge of the company's financial records.\n\n### Robert Costello\n\nRobert Costello, a lawyer who had worked on Trump's behalf, testified about his knowledge of the hush-money payment and the company's financial records.\n\n## Closing arguments and jury instructions\n\nThe prosecution and defense delivered their closing arguments on November 20, 2023. The judge delivered jury instructions on November 21, 2023.\n\n## Jury deliberations and verdict\n\nThe jury deliberated for several days before returning a verdict on December 6, 2023. Trump was found guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying business records.\n\n# Post-trial proceedings\n\n## Gag order\n\nThe trial judge lifted the gag order, allowing the parties and their lawyers to make public statements about the case.\n\n## Delayed sentencing hearing\n\nThe sentencing hearing was delayed to allow the defense to file post-trial motions.\n\n## Immunity ruling\n\nThe judge ruled that several witnesses who had testified at trial were entitled to immunity from prosecution.\n\n## Firearms and liquor licenses\n\nThe conviction raised questions about Trump's eligibility to hold firearms and liquor licenses in New York State.\n\n## Potential appeal of conviction\n\nTrump's lawyers announced that they would appeal the conviction to the New York State Appellate Division.\n\n# Reactions\n\nThe verdict sparked a range of reactions from politicians, commentators, and the public. Some hailed the verdict as a victory for accountability, while others criticized the prosecution as politically motivated.\n\n# See also\n\n* Stormy Daniels–Donald Trump scandal\n* Manhattan DA investigation into Donald Trump\n* Donald Trump's eligibility to serve as president\n\n# Notes\n\n* This article is based on publicly available information and may not reflect the complete record of the case.\n\n# References\n\n* This article does not include citations or references.\n\n# External links\n\n* New York State Supreme Court website\n* Manhattan District Attorney's Office website", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Prosecution_of_Donald_Trump_in_New_York\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Stormy Daniels–Donald Trump scandal\n##Manhattan DA investigation and grand jury\n##Eligibility for president\n#Initial proceedings\n##Indictment and charges\n##Arraignment\n#Pre-trial proceedings\n##Request for indictment dismissal\n##Discovery materials and witnesses\n##Requests for recusal\n##Request for removal to federal court\n##Trial scheduling\n##Gag order\n##Statute of limitations\n#Overview of witnesses\n#Trial\n##Jury selection and opening statements\n##Contempt hearings\n##Prosecution witnesses\n###David Pecker\n###Graff, Farro, Browning, and Thompson\n###Keith Davidson and Douglas Daus\n###Hope Hicks\n###McConney, Tarasoff, and Franklin\n###Stormy Daniels\n###Manochio, Menzies, and Westerhout\n###Dixon, Tomalin, Longstreet, and Jarmel-Schneider\n###Michael Cohen\n##Defense witnesses\n###Daniel Sitko\n###Robert Costello\n##Closing arguments and jury instructions\n##Jury deliberations and verdict\n#Post-trial proceedings\n##Gag order\n##Delayed sentencing hearing\n##Immunity ruling\n##Firearms and liquor licenses\n##Potential appeal of conviction\n#Reactions\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The brigade has undergone significant changes in its structure, leadership, and activities over the years, and has been the subject of controversy due to allegations of neo-Nazism and human rights abuses.\n\n# History\n\n## Background and founding, February–April 2014\n\nThe Azov Brigade was formed in February 2014, during the Euromaidan protests in Ukraine. The group was founded by Andriy Biletsky, a Ukrainian nationalist and former leader of the Social-National Assembly (SNA), a far-right organization. The brigade's initial goal was to provide security for the protests and counterbalance the influence of pro-Russian groups in the country. The group's name, \"Azov,\" refers to the Sea of Azov, which borders Ukraine to the southeast.\n\n## Special Tasks Patrol Police, May 2014\n\nIn May 2014, the Azov Brigade was officially recognized as a Special Tasks Patrol Police unit by the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs. This designation gave the group the authority to conduct law enforcement activities and maintain public order in the country. The brigade's leader, Andriy Biletsky, was appointed as the commander of the Special Tasks Patrol Police unit.\n\n## Reorganisation and incorporation into the National Guard of Ukraine, November 2014\n\nIn November 2014, the Azov Brigade was reorganized and incorporated into the National Guard of Ukraine (NGU). This move was part of a broader effort to reform and strengthen Ukraine's security forces. As part of the NGU, the Azov Brigade was assigned to the 12th Operational Brigade, which is responsible for maintaining order and conducting counter-terrorism operations in the country.\n\n## Battle of Shyrokyne, January 2015\n\nIn January 2015, the Azov Brigade participated in the Battle of Shyrokyne, a key conflict in the ongoing war in eastern Ukraine. The battle was fought between Ukrainian government forces and Russian-backed separatist groups for control of the strategic town of Shyrokyne, which is located near the city of Mariupol. The Azov Brigade played a significant role in the battle, helping to secure key positions and repel separatist attacks.\n\n## 2016–2019\n\nBetween 2016 and 2019, the Azov Brigade continued to play an active role in the conflict in eastern Ukraine. The group was involved in various battles and skirmishes, including the Battle of Avdiivka in 2017. During this period, the brigade also received training and support from international partners, including the United States and Canada.\n\n## Russian invasion of Ukraine\n\nIn February 2022, Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine, which led to a significant escalation of the conflict. The Azov Brigade played a key role in the defense of Ukraine, particularly in the city of Mariupol, which was heavily besieged by Russian forces.\n\n### Defense of Mariupol\n\nThe Azov Brigade was one of the main units defending Mariupol against the Russian invasion. The group fought bravely, but was significantly outnumbered and outgunned by Russian forces. Despite this, the brigade managed to hold out for several weeks, inflicting significant casualties on Russian troops.\n\n### Other 'Azov' units\n\nIn addition to the Azov Brigade, there are several other units that bear the name \"Azov.\" These units are part of the Ukrainian Territorial Defense Forces (TDF) and are responsible for defending key cities and territories in the country. The Azov units are known for their bravery and dedication to defending Ukraine.\n\n# Leadership and organisation\n\n## Commanders\n\nThe Azov Brigade has had several commanders since its founding in 2014. The group's first commander was Andriy Biletsky, who led the brigade during its early years. In 2016, Biletsky was replaced by Maksym Zhorin, who served as the brigade's commander until 2018. The current commander of the Azov Brigade is not publicly known.\n\n## Status\n\nThe Azov Brigade is a volunteer militia that is officially recognized by the Ukrainian government. The group is part of the National Guard of Ukraine and is subject to the authority of the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs.\n\n## Foreign fighters\n\nThe Azov Brigade has attracted foreign fighters from around the world, including from Europe, North America, and other regions. These fighters have joined the brigade for a variety of reasons, including to support Ukraine's sovereignty and to fight against Russian aggression.\n\n# Azov movement\n\nThe Azov movement is a broader nationalist movement that encompasses the Azov Brigade and other organizations.

It is the largest and most complex space telescope ever built, with a segmented primary mirror made of 18 hexagonal mirrors that can be adjusted to form a precise optical instrument. The JWST is a successor to the Hubble Space Telescope and is designed to study the formation of the first stars and galaxies in the early universe, as well as the formation of stars and planetary systems in our own galaxy.\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n### Location and Orbit\n\nThe JWST is located at the second Lagrange point (L2), which is about 1.5 million kilometers from Earth. This location allows the JWST to maintain a stable temperature, which is necessary for its infrared instruments to function. The L2 point is a gravitationally stable location where the gravitational pull of the Earth and the Sun balance each other, allowing the JWST to maintain a consistent distance from both bodies.\n\n### Sunshield Protection\n\nThe JWST has a large sunshield that protects its instruments from the heat and light of the Sun. The sunshield is made of five layers of a material called Kapton, which is designed to reflect the Sun's radiation. The sunshield is also designed to maintain a temperature difference of about 300°C between the hot and cold sides of the JWST.\n\n### Optics\n\nThe JWST has a segmented primary mirror made of 18 hexagonal mirrors that can be adjusted to form a precise optical instrument. The mirror is made of beryllium, which is a lightweight and stable material that is used in many optical instruments. The JWST also has a secondary mirror that is used to focus the light from the primary mirror onto the instruments.\n\n### Scientific Instruments\n\nThe JWST has four scientific instruments: the Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam), the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec), the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI), and the Fine Guidance Sensor (FGS). These instruments are designed to study the formation of stars and galaxies in the early universe, as well as the formation of stars and planetary systems in our own galaxy.\n\n### Spacecraft Bus\n\nThe JWST is built around a spacecraft bus that provides the power, communication, and navigation systems for the telescope. The spacecraft bus is designed to maintain a stable temperature and to provide a reliable power source for the JWST's instruments.\n\n### Servicing\n\nThe JWST is designed to be serviced by astronauts, but it is not expected to require servicing during its planned 5-year mission. The JWST has a modular design that allows its instruments to be easily replaced or upgraded.\n\n### Software\n\nThe JWST has a sophisticated software system that controls its instruments and spacecraft bus. The software is designed to optimize the JWST's performance and to provide a reliable and efficient way to operate the telescope.\n\nComparison with Other Telescopes\n--------------------------------\n\nThe JWST is the largest and most complex space telescope ever built, and it has a number of advantages over other telescopes. Its segmented primary mirror allows it to have a much larger collecting area than other telescopes, and its infrared instruments allow it to study objects that are too cool or distant to be detected by other telescopes.\n\nDevelopment History\n-------------------\n\n### Background (Development to 2003)\n\nThe JWST was first proposed in the 1990s as a successor to the Hubble Space Telescope. The JWST was designed to study the formation of the first stars and galaxies in the early universe, as well as the formation of stars and planetary systems in our own galaxy.\n\n### Early Development and Replanning (2003-2007)\n\nIn 2003, the JWST project was replanned to reduce its cost and complexity. The JWST's instruments were redesigned, and its mission was changed to focus on the formation of stars and galaxies in the early universe.\n\n### Detailed Design and Construction (2007-2021)\n\nThe JWST's detailed design and construction began in 2007. The JWST's instruments were built and tested, and its spacecraft bus was designed and constructed.\n\n### Cost and Schedule Issues\n\nThe JWST's development was delayed by a number of cost and schedule issues. The JWST's cost increased from an initial estimate of $3.5 billion to a final cost of $8.7 billion, and its launch was delayed from 2011 to 2021.\n\n### Partnership\n\nThe JWST is a partnership between NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). The JWST's instruments were built by a team of scientists and engineers from around the world.\n\n### Naming Concerns\n\nThe JWST was named after James E. Webb, who was the administrator of NASA from 1961 to 1968. There were some concerns about the naming of the JWST, as Webb was involved in the Lavender Scare, a period of persecution of LGBTQ+ individuals in the United States government.\n\nMission Goals\n-------------\n\n### Orbit Design\n\nThe JWST's orbit is designed to allow it to maintain a stable temperature, which is necessary for its infrared instruments to function. The JWST's orbit is also designed to allow it to have a consistent distance from the Earth and the Sun.\n\n### Infrared Astronomy\n\nThe JWST is designed to conduct infrared astronomy, which allows it to study objects that are too cool or distant to be detected by other telescopes. The JWST's infrared instruments are designed to study the formation of stars and galaxies in the early universe, as well as the formation of stars and planetary systems in our own galaxy.\n\nGround Support and Operations\n-----------------------------\n\n### Micrometeoroid Strike\n\nThe JWST is designed to withstand micrometeoroid strikes, which could potentially damage its instruments or spacecraft bus. The JWST's instruments are designed to be redundant, so that if one instrument is damaged, others can continue to function.\n\nFrom Launch Through Commissioning\n---------------------------------\n\n### Launch\n\nThe JWST was launched on December 25, 2021, aboard an Ariane 5 rocket from the Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana.\n\n### Transit and Structural Deployment\n\nAfter launch, the JWST began its transit to the L2 point, where it would begin its scientific mission. The JWST's structural deployment began after launch, as its sunshield and primary mirror were unfolded and deployed.\n\n### Commissioning and Testing\n\nThe JWST's commissioning and testing phase began after its structural deployment was complete. The JWST's instruments were tested and calibrated, and its spacecraft bus was checked out.\n\nAllocation of Observation Time\n-------------------------------\n\n### Early Release Science Program\n\nThe JWST's Early Release Science program allows scientists to submit proposals for observation time on the JWST. The program is designed to allow scientists to conduct early science with the JWST, and to demonstrate its capabilities.\n\n### General Observer Program\n\nThe JWST's General Observer program allows scientists to submit proposals for observation time on the JWST. The program is designed to allow scientists to conduct science with the JWST, and to make the most of its capabilities.\n\nScientific Results\n------------------\n\n### First Full-Color Images\n\nThe JWST's first full-color images were released in July 2022. The images showed the galaxy cluster SMACS J0723.3-7327, and demonstrated the JWST's capabilities.\n\n### Bright Early Galaxies\n\nThe JWST has discovered a number of bright early galaxies, which are galaxies that are seen as they were just 400 million years after the Big Bang. These galaxies are important for understanding the formation and evolution of the early universe.\n\n### Subsequent Noteworthy Observations and Interpretations\n\nThe JWST has made a number of subsequent noteworthy observations and interpretations, including the discovery of water vapor on a distant exoplanet, and the study of the formation of stars and planetary systems in our own galaxy.\n\n### Gallery\n\nThe JWST's gallery of images and spectra is available online, and shows the range of its capabilities.\n\nSee Also\n--------\n\n* Hubble Space Telescope\n* Spitzer Space Telescope\n* Kepler Space Telescope\n* Space Telescope Science Institute\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nThis article is a general overview of the James Webb Space Telescope.
