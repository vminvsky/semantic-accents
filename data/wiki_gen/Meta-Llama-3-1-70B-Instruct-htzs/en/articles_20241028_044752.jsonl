He has been a member of the Labour Party and has represented the Rimutaka electorate in the House of Representatives since 2008.\n\n#Early life\n\nChris Hipkins was born on 5 September 1978 in Hutt Valley, New Zealand. He grew up in the suburb of Waterloo, Lower Hutt, and was educated at Waterloo Primary School and Hutt Valley High School. Hipkins developed an interest in politics at a young age, inspired by his parents' involvement in local community groups. He joined the Labour Party while still at high school and quickly became involved in local party activities.\n\nAfter completing his secondary education, Hipkins attended Victoria University of Wellington, where he studied politics and criminology. During his time at university, he was involved in student politics and served as the president of the Victoria University of Wellington Students' Association. After graduating, Hipkins worked as a policy advisor for the New Zealand Police and later as a senior advisor to the Minister of Education.\n\n#In Opposition, 2008–2017\n\n##Standing as a parliamentary candidate (2008)\n\nIn 2008, Hipkins was selected as the Labour Party's candidate for the Rimutaka electorate. He won the seat in the 2008 general election, defeating the incumbent National Party MP, Paul Swain. Hipkins' victory was seen as a significant upset, as the National Party had held the seat for over 20 years.\n\n##First term (2008–2011)\n\nDuring his first term in parliament, Hipkins served as a member of the Labour Party's frontbench. He was appointed as the party's spokesperson for Internal Affairs and was also a member of the Education and Science select committee. Hipkins quickly established himself as a skilled and effective debater, earning a reputation as one of the Labour Party's most promising young MPs.\n\n##Second term (2011–2014)\n\nIn the 2011 general election, Hipkins was re-elected as the MP for Rimutaka, increasing his majority over the National Party candidate. During his second term, Hipkins continued to serve as a member of the Labour Party's frontbench, taking on additional responsibilities as the party's spokesperson for Education.\n\n##Third term (2014–2017)\n\nIn the 2014 general election, Hipkins was re-elected for a third term as the MP for Rimutaka. During this period, he continued to serve as the Labour Party's spokesperson for Education, playing a key role in the party's opposition to the National Party's education policies.\n\n#In Government (2017–2023)\n\n##Fourth term (2017–2020)\n\nIn the 2017 general election, the Labour Party, led by Jacinda Ardern, formed a coalition government with the New Zealand First Party and the Green Party. Hipkins was appointed as the Minister of Education and the Minister for the Public Service. As Education Minister, Hipkins oversaw a major overhaul of the education system, including the introduction of new curriculum standards and a significant increase in funding for schools.\n\n##Fifth term (2020–2023)\n\nIn the 2020 general election, the Labour Party won a landslide victory, securing a majority of seats in the House of Representatives. Hipkins was re-elected as the MP for Rimutaka and continued to serve as the Minister of Education and the Minister for the Public Service. During this period, he played a key role in the government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, overseeing the development and implementation of the country's vaccination program.\n\n#Prime Minister (2023)\n\n##Nomination and appointment\n\nIn January 2023, Jacinda Ardern announced her resignation as Prime Minister, citing a desire to spend more time with her family. Hipkins was subsequently nominated as her successor by the Labour Party caucus and was sworn in as the Prime Minister of New Zealand on 25 January 2023.\n\n##Domestic affairs\n\nAs Prime Minister, Hipkins has continued to focus on the key policy areas that he worked on as Minister of Education, including education reform and public service modernization. He has also taken a strong stance on issues such as climate change and economic inequality, committing to significant investments in renewable energy and social welfare programs.\n\n##Foreign affairs\n\nHipkins has continued to maintain New Zealand's strong relationships with key international partners, including Australia, the United States, and the European Union. He has also taken a strong stance on issues such as human rights and disarmament, committing to continued support for international efforts to promote peace and stability.\n\n##2023 general election\n\nHipkins will face his first general election as Prime Minister in 2023. The election is expected to be closely contested, with the National Party and other opposition parties seeking to capitalize on any perceived weaknesses in the government's performance. Hipkins has promised to run a positive campaign, focusing on the government's achievements and its vision for the future.\n\n#In Opposition (2023–present)\n\nAs of the time of writing, Hipkins is still serving as the Prime Minister of New Zealand. However, the outcome of the 2023 general election is uncertain, and it is possible that he may find himself in opposition in the future. If this occurs, Hipkins is likely to remain a prominent figure in New Zealand politics, continuing to advocate for the policies and values that he has championed throughout his career.\n\n#Political views\n\nHipkins is a member of the Labour Party and has consistently identified as a center-left politician. He has expressed strong support for social democracy and has advocated for policies such as greater investment in public services, progressive taxation, and stronger labor laws.\n\n#Public image\n\nHipkins has a reputation as a competent and effective politician. He is widely respected for his intelligence, his work ethic, and his commitment to public service. However, he has also faced criticism for his handling of certain policy issues, including education reform and the government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n#Personal life\n\nHipkins is married to Jade Hipkins, and the couple has two children together. He is a keen sports fan and enjoys playing golf and watching rugby in his free time. Hipkins is also a talented musician and has been known to play the guitar at social events.\n\n#References\n\n#External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Chris_Hipkins\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n#In Opposition, 2008–2017\n##Standing as a parliamentary candidate (2008)\n##First term (2008–2011)\n##Second term (2011–2014)\n##Third term (2014–2017)\n#In Government (2017–2023)\n##Fourth term (2017–2020)\n##Fifth term (2020–2023)\n#Prime Minister (2023)\n##Nomination and appointment\n##Domestic affairs\n##Foreign affairs\n##2023 general election\n#In Opposition (2023–present)\n#Political views\n#Public image\n#Personal life\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

While the concept of fantasy has been present in human imagination throughout history, the modern notion of fantasy as a distinct genre has developed over the past few centuries. This article explores the history of fantasy, tracing its evolution from ancient mythologies to modern-day fiction.\n\n# Differences between fantasy and earlier fantastic works\n\nFantasy, as a genre, is distinct from earlier forms of fantastic literature, such as mythology, folklore, and fairy tales. While these earlier forms often featured supernatural or magical elements, they were typically presented as factual accounts or explanations of natural phenomena. In contrast, fantasy fiction is characterized by its deliberate departure from reality, often creating entirely new worlds, creatures, and rules.\n\nMoreover, fantasy fiction frequently employs a narrative structure that is distinct from earlier forms of storytelling. Fantasy stories often feature quests, heroes, and villains, and are typically set in imaginary worlds with their own geography, history, and mythology. This distinctive narrative structure sets fantasy apart from earlier forms of fantastic literature, which were often more focused on conveying moral or cultural values.\n\n# Development of fantasy\n\nThe development of fantasy as a genre can be broadly divided into several key periods, each characterized by significant cultural, social, and literary trends.\n\n## Romances\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, the romance genre emerged as a major literary force. Romances were long, narrative poems that often featured magical or supernatural elements, such as the works of Chrétien de Troyes or Sir Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur. While not strictly fantasy in the modern sense, these works laid the groundwork for the development of fantasy as a genre.\n\nRomances frequently featured heroic quests, magical creatures, and enchanted landscapes, all of which would become staples of the fantasy genre. Moreover, the romance genre's emphasis on chivalry, honor, and courtly love helped to shape the moral and social values that would underpin many fantasy stories.\n\n## The Enlightenment\n\nThe Enlightenment, which spanned the 17th and 18th centuries, saw a significant shift in the way people thought about the world. As scientific inquiry and rationalism gained prominence, many writers began to explore the possibilities of rational, scientific explanations for natural phenomena. This led to a decline in the popularity of supernatural or magical themes in literature.\n\nHowever, the Enlightenment also saw the emergence of new literary forms, such as the philosophical novel and the utopian tale. Works like Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels or Voltaire's Candide employed satire and social commentary to explore the human condition, often incorporating fantastical elements in the process.\n\n## Romanticism\n\nThe Romantic movement, which spanned the late 18th and early 19th centuries, saw a resurgence of interest in the supernatural, the irrational, and the emotional. Romantic writers like Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Lord Byron, and Percy Bysshe Shelley explored the possibilities of fantasy and the sublime, often incorporating elements of folklore, mythology, and fairy tales into their work.\n\nRomanticism's emphasis on the individual, the emotional, and the irrational helped to create a fertile ground for the development of fantasy as a genre. Moreover, the Romantic movement's focus on the beauty and power of nature helped to shape the fantasy genre's emphasis on landscapes, environments, and the natural world.\n\n# Modern fantasy\n\nThe modern fantasy genre, as we know it today, emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\n## Pre-Tolkien\n\nBefore the publication of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit in 1937, fantasy fiction was largely dominated by the likes of George MacDonald, William Morris, and Lord Dunsany. These writers helped to shape the fantasy genre, exploring themes of mythology, folklore, and fairy tales.\n\nHowever, it was not until the early 20th century that fantasy began to emerge as a distinct genre, with writers like H.P. Lovecraft, Clark Ashton Smith, and Robert E. Howard creating new and innovative works of fantasy fiction.\n\n## Tolkien\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings are widely regarded as the foundational texts of modern fantasy. Tolkien's work drew heavily on his love of mythology, languages, and history, creating a richly detailed and immersive world that has captivated readers for generations.\n\nTolkien's influence on the fantasy genre cannot be overstated. His work helped to establish the fantasy genre as a major literary force, and his influence can be seen in countless other authors, from C.S. Lewis to George R.R. Martin.\n\n## Post-Tolkien\n\nIn the decades following Tolkien's publication of The Lord of the Rings, the fantasy genre continued to evolve and diversify. Writers like Ursula K. Le Guin, Terry Pratchett, and Neil Gaiman helped to push the boundaries of the genre, exploring new themes, styles, and sub-genres.\n\nThe rise of fantasy fiction in the latter half of the 20th century was also accompanied by the emergence of new sub-genres, such as epic fantasy, urban fantasy, and fantasy of manners. Moreover, the fantasy genre has continued to intersect with other genres, such as science fiction, horror, and historical fiction.\n\n# References\n\n## Further reading\n\n* Attebery, Brian.

{"title": "Free_substitution", "content": "#Sports that allow free substitution\n##Sports that allow unlimited substitution during live play\n##Sports that allow unlimited substitutions during stoppages of play only\n#Sports with limited substitution\n##Sports that allow a limited number of substitutions\n##Sports that only allow substitution to replace injured players\n#Sports with mixed or hybrid systems\n#See also\n#Notes\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Free Substitution\n\nFree substitution refers to the practice in various sports of allowing players to be replaced by others during a game, either with or without restrictions. This concept has been adopted in different forms across various sports, with some allowing unlimited substitutions, while others impose limitations on the number of substitutions or the circumstances under which they can occur.\n\n# Sports that allow free substitution\n\n## Sports that allow unlimited substitution during live play\n\nIn some sports, teams are allowed to make substitutions freely during live play, without any restrictions on the number of substitutions or the timing of when they can occur. Examples of sports that allow unlimited substitution during live play include:\n\n* Ice hockey: In ice hockey, teams are allowed to make line changes on the fly, with players substituting in and out of the game during live play.\n* Lacrosse: Similar to ice hockey, lacrosse teams are also allowed to make substitutions during live play, with players entering and exiting the game as needed.\n* Field hockey: Field hockey teams are allowed to make substitutions during live play, with players substituting in and out of the game without restrictions.\n\nThese sports typically feature high-intensity, fast-paced action, and the ability to make substitutions freely allows teams to keep fresh players on the field and maintain a high level of performance.\n\n## Sports that allow unlimited substitutions during stoppages of play only\n\nIn other sports, teams are allowed to make unlimited substitutions, but only during stoppages of play. This means that substitutions can only be made when the game is not in progress, such as during timeouts, between periods, or during other interruptions in play. Examples of sports that allow unlimited substitutions during stoppages of play only include:\n\n* Basketball: In basketball, teams are allowed to make substitutions during timeouts, between quarters, and during other stoppages of play.\n* Football: Football teams are allowed to make substitutions during timeouts, between plays, and during other stoppages of play.\n* Volleyball: Volleyball teams are allowed to make substitutions during timeouts, between sets, and during other stoppages of play.\n\nThese sports typically feature more structured gameplay, with more frequent interruptions in play, and the ability to make substitutions during stoppages of play allows teams to make strategic decisions about player deployment.\n\n# Sports with limited substitution\n\n## Sports that allow a limited number of substitutions\n\nIn some sports, teams are allowed to make a limited number of substitutions, either per game or per half. This means that teams must carefully manage their substitutions, as they are limited in the number of changes they can make. Examples of sports that allow a limited number of substitutions include:\n\n* Soccer: In soccer, teams are allowed to make three substitutions per game, with some exceptions for injuries and red cards.\n* Rugby: Rugby teams are allowed to make a limited number of substitutions, typically seven or eight per game, depending on the specific competition.\n* Cricket: Cricket teams are allowed to make a limited number of substitutions, typically two or three per game, depending on the specific competition.\n\nThese sports typically require teams to carefully manage their resources, as the limited number of substitutions means that teams must be strategic about when and how they make changes to their lineup.\n\n## Sports that only allow substitution to replace injured players\n\nIn some sports, substitutions are only allowed in the event of an injury to a player. This means that teams are not allowed to make tactical substitutions, and any substitutions that are made must be due to a legitimate injury to a player. Examples of sports that only allow substitution to replace injured players include:\n\n* Baseball: In baseball, substitutions are only allowed in the event of an injury to a player, with some exceptions for pinch-hitting and defensive replacements.\n* Softball: Softball teams are only allowed to make substitutions in the event of an injury to a player.\n* Golf: Golfers are not allowed to make substitutions, as each player must complete the round on their own.\n\nThese sports typically place a high premium on individual performance, and the limited substitution rules mean that teams must rely on their players to perform at a high level throughout the competition.\n\n# Sports with mixed or hybrid systems\n\nSome sports feature mixed or hybrid systems, which combine elements of different substitution rules. For example:\n\n* American football: American football teams are allowed to make unlimited substitutions during stoppages of play, but are also allowed to make limited substitutions during live play, such as when a player is injured.\n* Water polo: Water polo teams are allowed to make unlimited substitutions during live play, but are also required to make substitutions through a designated substitution area.\n\nThese sports typically feature complex rules and regulations, and the mixed or hybrid substitution systems reflect the unique demands and challenges of each sport.\n\n# See also\n\n* Substitution (sports)\n* Timeout (sports)\n* Injury (sports)\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article provides an overview of the different substitution rules and systems used in various sports. The rules and regulations governing substitution can vary significantly from one sport to another, and this article aims to provide a comprehensive and informative guide to the different approaches used in different sports.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Free_substitution\" following this outline:\n\n#Sports that allow free substitution\n##Sports that allow unlimited substitution during live play\n##Sports that allow unlimited substitutions during stoppages of play only\n#Sports with limited substitution\n##Sports that allow a limited number of substitutions\n##Sports that only allow substitution to replace injured players\n#Sports with mixed or hybrid systems\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The strike, which began on July 14, 2023, was the first major labor action by SAG-AFTRA in over 40 years and had significant implications for the film and television industry.\n\n# Background\n\n## Unionization in Hollywood\n\nThe history of unionization in Hollywood dates back to the early 20th century, when actors, writers, and directors began organizing to improve their working conditions and compensation. The Screen Actors Guild (SAG) was founded in 1933, and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA) was established in 1937. The two unions merged in 2012 to form SAG-AFTRA, which represents over 160,000 film and television actors, journalists, radio personalities, recording artists, singers, and other media professionals.\n\n## Pre-strike activity\n\nIn the months leading up to the strike, SAG-AFTRA and the AMPTP engaged in tense negotiations over a new collective bargaining agreement. The union sought significant increases in compensation and benefits for its members, as well as improved working conditions and greater protections against the use of artificial intelligence and other technologies that could potentially replace human actors. The AMPTP, which represents the major studios, was resistant to many of these demands, citing concerns about the economic impact of the proposed changes.\n\n# Timeline\n\n## July\n\nThe 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike began on July 14, 2023, after negotiations between the union and the AMPTP broke down. The strike was authorized by a vote of the SAG-AFTRA membership, with over 98% of members supporting the action. The strike affected film and television production across the United States, with many projects shutting down or being delayed.\n\n## August\n\nIn August, the strike showed no signs of ending, with both sides dug in and refusing to budge. The AMPTP launched a public relations campaign aimed at portraying the union as unreasonable and greedy, while SAG-AFTRA countered with its own campaign highlighting the struggles of its members and the need for fair compensation and working conditions.\n\n## September\n\nIn September, the strike began to have a significant impact on the film and television industry, with many projects facing delays or cancellations. The Emmys, one of the most prestigious awards ceremonies in the industry, were also affected, with many nominees and presenters refusing to cross the picket line.\n\n## October\n\nIn October, the strike entered its third month, with no end in sight. The AMPTP began to feel the economic impact of the strike, with many studios facing significant losses. SAG-AFTRA, however, remained resolute, with its members continuing to hold firm on their demands.\n\n## November\n\nIn November, the strike took a dramatic turn, with the Writers Guild of America (WGA) announcing its support for SAG-AFTRA and threatening to join the strike if its own negotiations with the AMPTP broke down. The WGA, which represents writers in the film and television industry, had been watching the SAG-AFTRA strike closely and was sympathetic to the union's demands.\n\n## December\n\nIn December, the strike finally came to an end, with SAG-AFTRA and the AMPTP reaching a tentative agreement on a new collective bargaining agreement. The agreement included many of the concessions that SAG-AFTRA had been seeking, including increased compensation and benefits for its members, as well as improved working conditions and greater protections against the use of artificial intelligence and other technologies.\n\n# Strike activity and responses\n\n## Locations\n\nThe 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike was a national strike, with picket lines and rallies taking place in cities across the United States. The strike was particularly active in Los Angeles and New York, where many of the major film and television studios are located.\n\n## Media executives' response\n\nThe response of media executives to the strike was largely negative, with many portraying the union as unreasonable and greedy. The AMPTP, which represents the major studios, launched a public relations campaign aimed at undermining the union's demands and portraying the strike as unnecessary and economically damaging.\n\n## Politicians' response\n\nMany politicians, including some in the California state legislature and the U.S. Congress, expressed support for the strike and the union's demands. Some politicians, however, were more neutral, calling for both sides to negotiate in good faith and reach a fair agreement.\n\n## Other unions' response\n\nThe response of other unions to the strike was largely supportive, with many unions expressing solidarity with SAG-AFTRA and its members. The WGA, which represents writers in the film and television industry, was particularly supportive, threatening to join the strike if its own negotiations with the AMPTP broke down.\n\n## Other organizations' response\n\nMany other organizations, including some in the film and television industry, expressed support for the strike and the union's demands. Some organizations, however, were more neutral, calling for both sides to negotiate in good faith and reach a fair agreement.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike had a significant impact on the film and television industry, with many projects facing delays or cancellations. The strike also had a significant economic impact, with many studios facing significant losses. The strike, however, ultimately resulted in a new collective bargaining agreement that included many of the concessions that SAG-AFTRA had been seeking.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe aftermath of the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike was marked by a sense of relief and accomplishment, with many in the film and television industry hailing the new collective bargaining agreement as a major victory for SAG-AFTRA and its members. The strike, however, also highlighted the ongoing challenges facing the industry, including the increasing use of artificial intelligence and other technologies that could potentially replace human actors.\n\n# See also\n\n* 2007-2008 Writers Guild of America strike\n* 2016-2017 video game voice actor strike\n* Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers\n* Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a factual and informative summary of the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike and its impact on the film and television industry.\n\n# References\n\nThis article does not include any citations or references.\n\n# External links\n\nThis article does not include any external links.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_SAG-AFTRA_strike\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Unionization in Hollywood\n##Pre-strike activity\n#Timeline\n##July\n##August\n##September\n##October\n##November\n##December\n#Strike activity and responses\n##Locations\n##Media executives' response\n##Politicians' response\n##Other unions' response\n##Other organizations' response\n##Impact\n#Aftermath\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He is best known for his victory at the Battle of Gettysburg, which repelled the second invasion of the North by the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, led by General Robert E. Lee.\n\nEarly Life and Education\n------------------------\n\nMeade was born on December 31, 1815, in Cádiz, Spain, to Richard Worsam Meade and Margaret Coats Butler Meade. His father was a wealthy merchant who had business interests in Spain. Meade was the first of seven children, and his family moved back to the United States when he was a young child. They settled in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where Meade spent most of his childhood.\n\nMeade attended the Mount Hope Institution in Baltimore, Maryland, and later graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1835. He was commissioned as a brevet second lieutenant in the United States Army Corps of Engineers.\n\nTopographical Corps and Mexican-American War\n--------------------------------------------\n\nMeade served in the Topographical Corps, where he was involved in the surveying and mapping of the United States. He worked on the survey of the Delaware River, the Philadelphia and Columbia Railroad, and the Alabama River.\n\nDuring the Mexican-American War, Meade served as a lieutenant in the Corps of Engineers. He was involved in the siege of Veracruz and the Battle of Chapultepec, where he was brevetted to captain. Meade's service in the war was marked by his bravery and technical expertise.\n\nAmerican Civil War\n-----------------\n\nMeade's service in the Civil War began in 1861, when he was appointed as a brigadier general of volunteers. He served in the Department of Pennsylvania, where he was responsible for organizing and training troops.\n\n### Peninsula Campaign\n\nIn 1862, Meade was assigned to the Army of the Potomac, where he served as a division commander in the V Corps. He was involved in the Peninsula Campaign, where he led his division in the Battle of Mechanicsville and the Seven Days Battles. Meade was wounded in the Battle of Mechanicsville, but he continued to serve despite his injury.\n\n### Maryland Campaign\n\nIn the fall of 1862, Meade served in the Maryland Campaign, where he led his division in the Battle of South Mountain and the Battle of Antietam. Although the battle was tactically inconclusive, it gave President Abraham Lincoln the opportunity to issue the Emancipation Proclamation.\n\n### Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville\n\nIn December 1862, Meade's division was involved in the Battle of Fredericksburg, where they suffered heavy casualties. In the spring of 1863, Meade served in the Chancellorsville Campaign, where he led his division in the Battle of Chancellorsville. Although the Confederate Army won a tactical victory, they suffered heavy casualties, including the loss of General Stonewall Jackson.\n\n### Gettysburg Campaign\n\n#### Command of the Army of the Potomac\n\nIn June 1863, Meade was appointed as the commander of the Army of the Potomac, replacing General Joseph Hooker. Meade's appointment was unexpected, and he had only a few days to prepare for the invasion of Pennsylvania by the Confederate Army.\n\n#### Battle of Gettysburg\n\nThe Battle of Gettysburg was fought from July 1 to July 3, 1863. Meade's army was initially pushed back through the town of Gettysburg, but they were able to regroup and form a defensive line on Cemetery Ridge. On the second day of the battle, the Confederate Army launched a massive assault on the Union positions, but they were repelled with heavy casualties. On the third day of the battle, the Confederate Army launched a final assault, known as Pickett's Charge, which was also repelled.\n\n#### Lee's Retreat\n\nAfter the Battle of Gettysburg, Meade's army pursued the Confederate Army as they retreated back to Virginia. Although Meade was criticized for not being more aggressive in his pursuit, he was able to keep the Confederate Army on the run and prevent them from launching another invasion of the North.\n\n### Bristoe and Mine Run Campaign\n\nIn the fall of 1863, Meade served in the Bristoe and Mine Run Campaigns, where he led his army in a series of battles against the Confederate Army. Although the campaign was tactically inconclusive, Meade was able to keep the Confederate Army off balance and prevent them from launching another invasion of the North.\n\n### Overland Campaign\n\nIn 1864, Meade served in the Overland Campaign, where he led his army in a series of battles against the Confederate Army. The campaign was marked by heavy casualties on both sides, but Meade was able to keep the Confederate Army on the run and prevent them from launching another invasion of the North.\n\n### Richmond-Petersburg Campaign\n\nIn the summer of 1864, Meade served in the Richmond-Petersburg Campaign, where he led his army in a series of battles against the Confederate Army. Although the campaign was tactically inconclusive, Meade was able to keep the Confederate Army pinned down and prevent them from launching another invasion of the North.\n\n### Political Rivalries\n\nMeade's service in the Civil War was marked by his rivalries with other generals, including General Ulysses S. Grant and General William Tecumseh Sherman. Meade was also involved in a series of controversies with politicians, including President Abraham Lincoln and Secretary of War Edwin Stanton.\n\nReconstruction\n-------------\n\nAfter the Civil War, Meade served as the military governor of the Third Military District, which included the states of Georgia, Alabama, and Florida. He was involved in the Reconstruction of the South and worked to ensure that the rights of freed slaves were protected.\n\nPersonal Life\n-------------\n\nMeade was married to Margaret Sergeant Meade, and they had seven children together. He was a member of the Episcopal Church and was known for his strong sense of morality and justice.\n\nLater Life and Death\n--------------------\n\nMeade died on November 6, 1872, at the age of 56, due to complications from pneumonia.

The point also stated that citizens who were called up would be given military training before being sent to Ukraine.\n\n#Organization\n\n##Text of decree\n\nThe decree outlined the organization of the mobilization, including the creation of a mobilization headquarters and the establishment of mobilization centers across Russia.\n\n##Citizens to be mobilized\n\nThe decree stated that citizens who were called up would include reservists, as well as those who had previously served in the military. The decree also stated that citizens who were called up would be given the opportunity to refuse to serve, but that those who did so would face penalties.\n\n#Implementation\n\n##Dates\n\nThe mobilization was set to begin on September 22, 2022, with the call-up of reservists and the recruitment of new soldiers. The mobilization was expected to last for several months.\n\n#Reactions\n\n##In Russia\n\n###Markets\n\nThe announcement of the mobilization led to a significant decline in the Russian stock market, with the ruble falling to a record low against the US dollar.\n\n###Russian officials and their families\n\nMany Russian officials and their families were seen fleeing Russia in the days following the announcement of the mobilization.\n\n###Within the Russian military\n\nThere were reports of low morale within the Russian military, with many soldiers expressing concerns about the mobilization and the prospect of being sent to Ukraine.\n\n###Help for army conscripts\n\nMany Russians took to social media to offer help and support to army conscripts, with some offering food, clothing, and other essentials.\n\n###Exodus of Russians\n\nIn the days following the announcement of the mobilization, there was a significant exodus of Russians from the country, with many fleeing to neighboring countries such as Kazakhstan and Georgia.\n\n###Protests\n\nThere were reports of protests across Russia, with many Russians expressing opposition to the mobilization and the war in Ukraine.\n\n###Attacks\n\nThere were reports of attacks on military recruitment centers across Russia, with some centers being set on fire.\n\n##In Ukraine\n\nThe announcement of the mobilization was seen as a significant escalation of the conflict in Ukraine, with many Ukrainians expressing concerns about the potential for increased violence.\n\n##International\n\nThe international community condemned the mobilization, with many countries expressing concerns about the potential for increased violence and instability in the region.\n\n#Analysis\n\n##Casualties\n\nThe mobilization was expected to lead to a significant increase in casualties on both sides, with many analysts predicting a prolonged and bloody conflict.\n\n#See also\n\n* 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* Russian military\n* Military conscription\n* War in Donbass\n\n#Notes\n\n#References", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Russian_mobilization\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics\n##Russia\n###Russian losses\n#Prelude\n##Volunteer recruitment campaign\n##Legislative changes\n##Recruitment of prisoners\n#Putin's speech\n#Decree\n##Official publication and entry into force\n##Point 7\n#Organization\n##Text of decree\n##Citizens to be mobilized\n#Implementation\n##Dates\n#Reactions\n##In Russia\n###Markets\n###Russian officials and their families\n###Within the Russian military\n###Help for army conscripts\n###Exodus of Russians\n###Protests\n###Attacks\n##In Ukraine\n##International\n#Analysis\n##Casualties\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

With a career spanning over five decades, Hersh has established himself as one of the most respected and feared investigative journalists in the world.\n\n#Early life and education\n\nSeymour Hersh was born on April 8, 1937, in Chicago, Illinois, to a family of Jewish immigrants from Lithuania. He grew up in a middle-class neighborhood in Chicago and developed an interest in journalism at an early age. Hersh attended the University of Chicago, where he studied history and later earned a bachelor's degree in 1958. After college, he worked as a police reporter for the City News Bureau in Chicago before joining the United States Army in 1959. During his time in the Army, Hersh served in the 3rd Armored Division and later as a press officer in the Pentagon.\n\n#Newspaper career\n\n##My Lai massacre\n\nHersh's investigative reporting career began in 1969, when he was working as a freelance journalist in Vietnam. He was the first to report on the My Lai Massacre, a mass killing of unarmed Vietnamese civilians by American soldiers in 1968. Hersh's reporting on the massacre, which was initially met with skepticism and resistance from the US military and government, eventually led to widespread outrage and calls for accountability. The story earned Hersh a Pulitzer Prize in 1970 and established him as a prominent voice in investigative journalism.\n\n##The New York Times\n\nIn 1972, Hersh joined The New York Times as a investigative reporter, where he worked alongside other prominent journalists, including Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein. During his time at the Times, Hersh reported on a wide range of topics, including the CIA's involvement in the overthrow of Salvador Allende in Chile and the US government's secret bombing campaign in Cambodia during the Vietnam War.\n\n#Investigative books: 1980s and 1990s\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, Hersh turned his attention to writing investigative books. His first book, \"The Price of Power: Kissinger in the Nixon White House\" (1983), was a critical examination of Henry Kissinger's role in shaping US foreign policy during the Nixon administration. The book was a bestseller and solidified Hersh's reputation as a fearless and dogged investigator.\n\nHersh went on to write several more books, including \"The Target Is Destroyed: What Really Happened to Flight 007 and What America Knew About It\" (1986), which explored the downing of Korean Air Lines Flight 007 by a Soviet Su-15 interceptors, and \"The Samson Option: Israel's Nuclear Arsenal and American Foreign Policy\" (1991), which examined Israel's nuclear program and its implications for US foreign policy.\n\n#Later investigations\n\n##Iraq and Abu Ghraib\n\nIn the early 2000s, Hersh turned his attention to the US-led invasion of Iraq and the subsequent occupation. He reported extensively on the treatment of Iraqi prisoners by US soldiers, including the Abu Ghraib prison abuse scandal.

(TV program)\n=====================\n\nE.A.T. is a Philippine television variety show that has been on the air since 1979. The show has undergone several changes in its format, hosts, and network affiliations over the years, but its core concept of entertainment, comedy, and public service has remained the same.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### RPN (1979–1989)\n\nE.A.T. first aired on July 30, 1979, on Radio Philippines Network (RPN) with a format that focused on entertainment, comedy, and news. The original hosts were Tito Sotto, Vic Sotto, and Joey de Leon, collectively known as the \"Tito, Vic, and Joey\" (TVJ) trio. The show quickly gained popularity and became a staple of Philippine television.\n\n### ABS-CBN (1989–1995)\n\nIn 1989, TVJ left RPN and moved to ABS-CBN, where they relaunched E.A.T. with a new format and new hosts. The show continued to thrive, with TVJ at the helm, until they left ABS-CBN in 1995.\n\n### GMA Network (1995–2024)\n\nIn 1995, TVJ signed a new contract with GMA Network and relaunched E.A.T. once again. This time, the show was renamed \"Eat Bulaga!\" and was broadcast from the GMA Broadway Centrum in Quezon City. The show continued to gain popularity and became one of the longest-running and most-watched television shows in the Philippines.\n\n### TVJ - TAPE Inc. conflict (2023–2024)\n\nIn 2023, a conflict arose between TVJ and TAPE Inc., the production company behind Eat Bulaga! TVJ, who had been hosting the show for over 40 years, wanted to take control of the show's production and management, while TAPE Inc. refused to give up its rights to the show. The conflict led to a series of lawsuits and counter-lawsuits between the parties.\n\n#### E.A.T. and TAPE's Eat Bulaga!\n\nAs part of the conflict, TVJ launched a new show called E.A.T. on TV5, which was a revival of the original E.A.T. format from the 1970s. Meanwhile, TAPE Inc. continued to produce Eat Bulaga! without TVJ.\n\n#### Eat Bulaga! trademark battle: TVJ emerges victorious\n\nIn a surprise move, TVJ won the trademark battle against TAPE Inc. for the rights to the Eat Bulaga! name. As a result, TAPE Inc. was forced to rename its show, which it did, calling it \"Eat na Ta!\".\n\n### TV5 and RPTV (since 2024)\n\nIn 2024, TVJ signed a new contract with TV5 and relaunched E.A.T. once again. The show is now broadcast on TV5 and RPTV, with TVJ at the helm.\n\nHosts\n-----\n\n### Current host\n\nThe current host of E.A.T. is the Tito, Vic, and Joey (TVJ) trio, consisting of Tito Sotto, Vic Sotto, and Joey de Leon.\n\n### Former host\n\nFormer hosts of E.A.T. include Chiqui Hollman, Richie Reyes, and Helen Vela.\n\nSegments\n--------\n\n### Current segments\n\n#### Sugod Bahay, Mga Kapatid!\n\nA segment where the hosts visit the homes of lucky viewers and give them prizes and surprises.\n\n#### Gimme 5: Laro ng mga Henyo\n\nA segment where contestants compete in a series of challenges to win prizes.\n\n#### Peraphy\n\nA segment where the hosts play a game of charades with celebrity guests.\n\n#### Barangay Bulagaan\n\nA segment where the hosts visit different barangays and play games with the residents.\n\n#### Dear Eat Bulaga\n\nA segment where viewers can write in and ask for advice or help from the hosts.\n\n#### Eat Bulaga Olympics\n\nA segment where the hosts compete in a series of physical challenges to win prizes.\n\n#### Bawal!

He is best known for his involvement in the Hundred Years' War and his subsequent trial and execution for the murder of numerous children. De Rais's life and crimes have been the subject of much speculation and debate, with some viewing him as a monster and others as a victim of circumstance.\n\n# House of Retz\n\n## Early life\n\nGilles de Rais was born in 1404 at the Château de Champtocé, in the province of Anjou, France. He was the son of Guy de Laval, Lord of Montjean, and Marie de Craon, heiress to the powerful Craon family. De Rais's family was part of the nobility, and he was raised with the expectation of becoming a military leader and defender of the faith.\n\n## Matrimonial projects\n\nIn 1417, de Rais's parents arranged for him to marry Béatrice de Rohan, but the marriage was annulled due to her family's opposition. In 1420, he married Catherine de Thouars, with whom he had one daughter, Marie.\n\n## Family disputes\n\nDe Rais's family was known for their disputes and conflicts with neighboring families. In 1425, his father was killed in a duel with a member of the rival family, the Chabot. De Rais's mother remarried, but her new husband, André de Lohéac, was also killed in a duel.\n\n## Titles, estates and wealth\n\nDe Rais inherited a significant amount of wealth and property from his family, including the titles of Lord of Retz, Lord of Champtocé, and Lord of Machecoul. He also acquired the title of Marshal of France through his military service.\n\n# Military career\n\n## First hypothetical feat of arms\n\nDe Rais's military career began at a young age, and he is said to have fought in his first battle at the age of 16. However, there is no concrete evidence to support this claim.\n\n## Franco-Breton alliance through the House of Valois-Anjou\n\nIn 1422, de Rais joined the army of Charles VII, King of France, and fought alongside him in the Hundred Years' War. He became a close ally of the king and was appointed as one of his chamberlains.\n\n## Guerilla warfare against English garrisons on the borders of Maine\n\nDe Rais led a series of successful campaigns against the English garrisons on the borders of Maine, using guerrilla warfare tactics to great effect.\n\n## Companion in arms with Joan of Arc\n\nIn 1429, de Rais met Joan of Arc, who had arrived in the French court to offer her services to the king. He became a close companion and supporter of hers, and fought alongside her in several battles.\n\n## Civil wars between La Trémoille and Richemont's allies\n\nIn 1432, de Rais became embroiled in the civil wars between the factions of La Trémoille and Richemont. He fought on the side of La Trémoille, but was eventually reconciled with Richemont.\n\n## Lifting of the siege of Lagny\n\nIn 1432, de Rais helped to lift the siege of Lagny, which had been besieged by the English. This was one of his most notable military victories.\n\n## Reduction of military commitments\n\nIn the late 1430s, de Rais began to reduce his military commitments, preferring to focus on his personal life and interests.\n\n# Squandering of heritage\n\nDe Rais was known for his extravagant lifestyle and his love of luxury. He spent vast sums of money on clothing, jewelry, and other lavish items, and was eventually forced to mortgage some of his properties to pay off his debts.\n\n# Criminal life\n\n## Occult involvement\n\nDe Rais became increasingly interested in the occult and alchemy, and was accused of making a pact with the devil. There is no concrete evidence to support this claim, but it is known that he was fascinated by the supernatural and the occult.\n\n## Child murders\n\nIn 1432, de Rais was accused of murdering a large number of children, mostly boys, in the town of Machecoul. The exact number of victims is unknown, but it is estimated to be between 40 and 200.\n\n## Act of force in Saint-Étienne-de-Mer-Morte\n\nIn 1438, de Rais was accused of using force to abduct a young boy from the town of Saint-Étienne-de-Mer-Morte. The boy was never seen again, and it is believed that he was murdered by de Rais.\n\n## Ecclesiastical and secular investigations\n\nIn 1440, de Rais was investigated by both ecclesiastical and secular authorities, who accused him of a range of crimes including murder, sodomy, and heresy.\n\n## Trial and execution\n\nDe Rais was put on trial in Nantes, and was found guilty of the charges against him. He was hanged on October 26, 1440, and his body was later burned.\n\n# Question of guilt\n\n## Doubts about the verdict in the Age of Enlightenment tradition\n\nIn the 18th century, some historians began to question the verdict against de Rais, suggesting that he may have been the victim of a miscarriage of justice.\n\n## Occultist interpretations\n\nSome occultists have interpreted de Rais's crimes as evidence of his involvement in a satanic cult.\n\n## Georges Bataille's interpretations\n\nThe French philosopher Georges Bataille wrote extensively about de Rais, viewing him as a symbol of the destructive power of the human imagination.\n\n## 1992 mock re-trial\n\nIn 1992, a mock re-trial of de Rais was held in France, which found him not guilty of the charges against him.\n\n## Contemporary academic views\n\nMost contemporary academics view de Rais as a serial killer who was responsible for the deaths of a large number of children. However, there is still some debate about the exact nature of his crimes and the motivations behind them.\n\n# Fictional portraits\n\nDe Rais has been the subject of numerous fictional portraits, including plays, novels, and films. He is often depicted as a monstrous figure, driven by a lust for power and a desire for blood.\n\n# Psychopathological interpretations\n\n## Fin de siècle portrayals\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, de Rais was often portrayed as a decadent figure, driven by his desires and impulses.\n\n## Classification as a serial killer\n\nDe Rais is often classified as a serial killer, due to the large number of victims he is believed to have murdered.\n\n# Gilles de Rais and the Bluebeard myth\n\nDe Rais's crimes have been linked to the myth of Bluebeard, a figure from French folklore who is said to have murdered his wives.\n\n# Relationship with Joan of Arc\n\nDe Rais's relationship with Joan of Arc has been the subject of much speculation and debate. Some have suggested that he was in love with her, while others have viewed their relationship as purely platonic.\n\n# See also\n\n* Hundred Years' War\n* Joan of Arc\n* Serial killer\n* Occult\n* Alchemy\n\n# References\n\n## Notes\n\n## Footnotes\n\n## Bibliography\n\n### Historical studies and literary scholarship\n\n* Georges Bataille, The Trial of Gilles de Rais (1965)\n* Jean-Pierre Brissaud, Gilles de Rais (1985)\n* Reginald Hyatte, The Trial of Gilles de Rais (1984)\n* Fernand Fleuret, Gilles de Rais (1980)\n\n### Essays\n\n* Georges Bataille, \"The Psychological Structure of Fascism\" (1933)\n* Georges Bataille, \"The Accursed Share\" (1949)\n\n# External links\n\n* Gilles de Rais on Wikipedia\n* The Trial of Gilles de Rais on Google Books\n* Georges Bataille on Wikipedia", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Gilles_de_Rais\" following this outline:\n\n#House of Retz\n##Early life\n##Matrimonial projects\n##Family disputes\n##Titles, estates and wealth\n#Military career\n##First hypothetical feat of arms\n##Franco-Breton alliance through the House of Valois-Anjou\n##Guerilla warfare against English garrisons on the borders of Maine\n##Companion in arms with Joan of Arc\n##Civil wars between La Trémoille and Richemont's allies\n##Lifting of the siege of Lagny\n##Reduction of military commitments\n#Squandering of heritage\n#Criminal life\n##Occult involvement\n##Child murders\n##Act of force in Saint-Étienne-de-Mer-Morte\n##Ecclesiastical and secular investigations\n##Trial and execution\n#Question of guilt\n##Doubts about the verdict in the Age of Enlightenment tradition\n##Occultist interpretations\n##Georges Bataille's interpretations\n##1992 mock re-trial\n##Contemporary academic views\n#Fictional portraits\n#Psychopathological interpretations\n##Fin de siècle portrayals\n##Classification as a serial killer\n#Gilles de Rais and the Bluebeard myth\n#Relationship with Joan of Arc\n#See also\n#References\n##Notes\n##Footnotes\n##Bibliography\n###Historical studies and literary scholarship\n###Essays\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The election was necessary due to the change in party control of the House, with the Republicans gaining a majority.\n\nProcess and Conventions\n\nIn the United States House of Representatives, the Speaker is elected by the members of the House, typically from the party with the majority. The election is usually a formality, with the party's caucus nominating a candidate who is then elected by the full House. However, the January 2023 election was unusual due to the narrow Republican majority and internal party divisions.\n\nThe House of Representatives follows a set of conventions and rules for the election of the Speaker. The election is typically held on the first day of the new Congress, and the Speaker is elected by a majority of the votes cast. If no candidate receives a majority on the first ballot, subsequent ballots are held until a candidate is elected.\n\nDemocratic Nomination\n\n### Candidates\n\n#### Nominee\n\nHakeem Jeffries, the Chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, was the nominee of the Democratic Party for Speaker. Jeffries was the first African American to lead a party in Congress and had the support of the majority of the Democratic caucus.\n\n#### Declined to Run\n\nSeveral other Democrats were mentioned as potential candidates for Speaker, but they declined to run. These included Nancy Pelosi, the outgoing Speaker, and Steny Hoyer, the outgoing Majority Leader.\n\n### Result\n\nJeffries was unanimously nominated by the Democratic caucus and received the support of all 212 Democratic members of the House.\n\nRepublican Nomination\n\n### Candidates\n\n#### Nominee\n\nKevin McCarthy, the House Minority Leader, was the nominee of the Republican Party for Speaker. McCarthy had the support of the majority of the Republican caucus, but faced opposition from a group of conservative Republicans.\n\n#### Lost Nomination\n\nSeveral other Republicans were mentioned as potential candidates for Speaker, but they lost the nomination to McCarthy. These included Steve Scalise, the House Minority Whip, and Jim Jordan, a prominent conservative Republican.\n\n### Results\n\nMcCarthy was nominated by the Republican caucus, but received only 188 votes, short of the majority needed to be elected Speaker.\n\nElection of the Speaker\n\n### Background\n\nThe election of the Speaker was marked by divisions within the Republican Party. A group of conservative Republicans, known as the \"Never Kevins,\" opposed McCarthy's nomination and refused to vote for him. This group was led by Matt Gaetz, Lauren Boebert, and Scott Perry.\n\n### Candidates\n\nThe main candidates for Speaker were Hakeem Jeffries and Kevin McCarthy. However, several other Republicans were nominated by their colleagues during the election process.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe election of the Speaker was a lengthy process that required 15 ballots over four days. McCarthy was eventually elected Speaker on the 15th ballot, after several concessions to the conservative Republicans.\n\n### Ballots 1–3 (January 3)\n\nOn the first day of the election, three ballots were held. McCarthy received 203 votes on the first ballot, but this number decreased to 202 on the second ballot and 201 on the third ballot. Jeffries received 212 votes on all three ballots.\n\n### Ballots 4–6 (January 4)\n\nOn the second day of the election, three ballots were held. McCarthy received 201 votes on all three ballots, while Jeffries received 212 votes.\n\n### Ballots 7–11 (January 5)\n\nOn the third day of the election, five ballots were held. McCarthy received 201 votes on all five ballots, while Jeffries received 212 votes.\n\n### Ballots 12–15 (January 6)\n\nOn the fourth day of the election, four ballots were held. McCarthy received 201 votes on the 12th ballot, but this number increased to 213 on the 15th ballot, after several concessions to the conservative Republicans. Jeffries received 212 votes on all four ballots.\n\n### All Ballots: Votes Not Cast for Party Nominee\n\nSeveral Republicans voted against their party's nominee during the election process. These included Matt Gaetz, Lauren Boebert, and Scott Perry.\n\n### All Ballots: Summary of Votes\n\nThe following table summarizes the votes cast during the election of the Speaker:\n\n| Ballot | Hakeem Jeffries (D) | Kevin McCarthy (R) | Other |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | 212 | 203 | 20 |\n| 2 | 212 | 202 | 21 |\n| 3 | 212 | 201 | 22 |\n| 4 | 212 | 201 | 22 |\n| 5 | 212 | 201 | 22 |\n| 6 | 212 | 201 | 22 |\n| 7 | 212 | 201 | 22 |\n| 8 | 212 | 201 | 22 |\n| 9 | 212 | 201 | 22 |\n| 10 | 212 | 201 | 22 |\n| 11 | 212 | 201 | 22 |\n| 12 | 212 | 201 | 22 |\n| 13 | 212 | 213 | 20 |\n| 14 | 212 | 213 | 20 |\n| 15 | 212 | 216 | 17 |\n\nImpact\n\n### Historical Context\n\nThe January 2023 Speaker election was the longest Speaker election since 1859, when it took 44 ballots to elect William Pennington as Speaker. The election was also marked by the first African American nominee for Speaker, Hakeem Jeffries.\n\n### Consequences While There Was No Speaker\n\nThe delay in electing a Speaker had several consequences for the House of Representatives. The House was unable to swear in its members, and several committee hearings were postponed.\n\n### C-SPAN Popularity\n\nThe Speaker election was widely covered by C-SPAN, which saw a significant increase in viewership during the election process. The network's coverage of the election was praised for its fairness and accuracy.\n\nSee Also\n\n* 2022 United States House of Representatives elections\n* 2022 United States elections\n* List of Speakers of the United States House of Representatives\n\nNotes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"January_2023_Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives_election\" following this outline:\n\n#Process and conventions\n#Democratic nomination\n##Candidates\n###Nominee\n###Declined to run\n##Result\n#Republican nomination\n##Candidates\n###Nominee\n###Lost nomination\n##Results\n#Election of the speaker\n##Background\n##Candidates\n##Summary\n##Ballots 1–3 (January 3)\n##Ballots 4–6 (January 4)\n##Ballots 7–11 (January 5)\n##Ballots 12–15 (January 6)\n##All ballots: votes not cast for party nominee\n##All ballots: summary of votes\n#Impact\n##Historical context\n##Consequences while there was no speaker\n##C-SPAN popularity\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This period saw a resurgence in classical Greek and Roman styles, as well as the development of new techniques and forms. Italian Renaissance sculpture had a profound impact on the art world, influencing artists and styles for centuries to come.\n\n# Periods\n\nItalian Renaissance sculpture can be broadly divided into three periods: the Early Renaissance (1350-1450), the High Renaissance (1450-1520), and the Late Renaissance (1520-1600). Each period saw significant developments in style, technique, and theme.\n\n# Materials\n\nItalian Renaissance sculptors used a variety of materials, each with its unique characteristics and challenges.\n\n## Stone\n\nMarble was the most prized material for sculpture, due to its fine grain and ability to be carved into intricate details. Many famous sculptures, such as Michelangelo's David, were carved from marble. Other types of stone, such as limestone and travertine, were also used.\n\n## Metal\n\nBronze was a popular material for sculpture, particularly for smaller works. It was valued for its durability and ability to be cast into intricate forms. Many bronze sculptures from the Renaissance period have survived to the present day.\n\n## Wood\n\nWood was a common material for sculpture, particularly for smaller works and decorative objects. It was often used for relief carvings and figurines.\n\n## Terracotta\n\nTerracotta, a type of earthenware, was used for sculpture, particularly for smaller works and decorative objects. It was often glazed and used for figurines and reliefs.\n\n## Other materials\n\nOther materials, such as ivory, bone, and wax, were also used for sculpture. These materials were often used for smaller works and decorative objects.\n\n## Coloured sculpture\n\nMany Italian Renaissance sculptures were painted or gilded to add color and decoration. This practice, known as polychromy, was particularly popular for wooden sculptures.\n\n# Settings\n\nItalian Renaissance sculptures were often created for specific settings, such as churches, tombs, and civic spaces.\n\n## Churches and tombs\n\nMany sculptures were created for churches and tombs, often depicting saints, biblical figures, and other religious subjects. These sculptures were often large-scale and intricately carved.\n\n## Civic pride\n\nSculptures were also created to promote civic pride and identity. Many cities and towns commissioned sculptures to adorn their public spaces and buildings.\n\n### Fountains\n\nFountains were a popular type of sculpture, often featuring mythological figures and animals. They were used to decorate public spaces and provide a source of water.\n\n## Portraits\n\nPortrait sculpture was a popular genre, particularly for wealthy patrons. Many famous artists, such as Michelangelo and Donatello, created portrait sculptures.\n\n### Equestrian statues\n\nEquestrian statues, depicting riders on horseback, were a popular type of portrait sculpture. They were often used to commemorate famous leaders and military victories.\n\n### Shoulder busts\n\nShoulder busts, depicting the head and shoulders of a subject, were a popular type of portrait sculpture. They were often used to commemorate famous individuals and leaders.\n\n### Medals\n\nMedals, small sculptures featuring a portrait or image on one side, were a popular type of portrait sculpture. They were often used to commemorate events and individuals.\n\n## Small sculpture\n\nSmall sculptures, such as figurines and reliefs, were popular decorative objects. They were often used to adorn homes and public spaces.\n\n# Workshops\n\nMany Italian Renaissance sculptors worked in workshops, often with apprentices and assistants. These workshops were often family-run and passed down through generations.\n\n## Women sculptors\n\nWhile women sculptors were relatively rare during the Italian Renaissance, some notable female artists emerged during this period. One famous example is Properzia de' Rossi, who worked in Bologna during the 16th century.\n\n# Guilds\n\nMany Italian Renaissance sculptors belonged to guilds, which were organizations of craftsmen and artists. These guilds helped regulate the profession and provided training and support for members.\n\n# Patrons\n\nItalian Renaissance sculpture was often commissioned by wealthy patrons, such as the Medici family in Florence. These patrons played a significant role in shaping the development of sculpture during this period.\n\n# Development of style\n\nItalian Renaissance sculpture developed over several centuries, influenced by classical styles and techniques.\n\n## To 1400\n\nDuring the 14th century, Italian sculpture was heavily influenced by Byzantine and Gothic styles. However, with the emergence of humanism and classical studies, sculptors began to look to ancient Greek and Roman models for inspiration.\n\n## From 1400\n\nThe 15th century saw a significant development in Italian Renaissance sculpture, particularly in Florence.\n\n### Doors of the Florence Baptistery\n\nThe doors of the Florence Baptistery, created by Lorenzo Ghiberti, are a famous example of early Renaissance sculpture. The doors feature intricate reliefs and demonstrate a strong classical influence.\n\n### Donatello\n\nDonatello was a prominent sculptor of the early Renaissance, known for his innovative and expressive works. His sculptures often featured contrapposto, a pose where the weight-bearing leg is relaxed and the free leg is tensed.\n\n### Middle of the century\n\nBy the middle of the 15th century, Italian Renaissance sculpture had developed a distinct style, characterized by naturalism, classical influences, and attention to detail.\n\n### Lombardy\n\nIn Lombardy, a region in northern Italy, sculpture developed a distinct style, characterized by a focus on decorative and ornate details.\n\n### Crisis of the 1490s\n\nThe 1490s saw a crisis in Italian Renaissance sculpture, as many artists were forced to flee their homes due to war and political instability. However, this period also saw the emergence of new styles and techniques.\n\n## 16th century\n\nThe 16th century saw the rise of Mannerism and Late Renaissance sculpture.\n\n### Michelangelo\n\nMichelangelo was a prominent sculptor of the 16th century, known for his iconic works such as the Pietà and David. His sculptures often featured complex and dynamic poses.\n\n### Mannerist and Late Renaissance sculpture\n\nMannerist sculpture, characterized by elongated forms and unnatural poses, emerged in the mid-16th century. Late Renaissance sculpture, characterized by a focus on naturalism and classical influences, emerged in the late 16th century.\n\n### Giambologna\n\nGiambologna was a prominent sculptor of the Late Renaissance, known for his elegant and refined works. His sculptures often featured complex and dynamic poses.\n\n# Italians abroad\n\nMany Italian Renaissance sculptors worked abroad, particularly in France and the Netherlands.\n\n# Notes\n\n# References\n\n# External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Italian_Renaissance_sculpture\" following this outline:\n\n#Periods\n#Materials\n##Stone\n##Metal\n##Wood\n##Terracotta\n##Other materials\n##Coloured sculpture\n#Settings\n##Churches and tombs\n##Civic pride\n###Fountains\n##Portraits\n###Equestrian statues\n###Shoulder busts\n###Medals\n##Small sculpture\n#Workshops\n##Women sculptors\n#Guilds\n#Patrons\n#Development of style\n##To 1400\n##From 1400\n###Doors of the Florence Baptistery\n###Donatello\n###Middle of the century\n###Lombardy\n###Crisis of the 1490s\n##16th century\n###Michelangelo\n###Mannerist and Late Renaissance sculpture\n###Giambologna\n#Italians abroad\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Its origins are rooted in the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, who preached a message of love, redemption, and salvation to the people of ancient Palestine. From its humble beginnings as a small Jewish sect, Christianity has grown into a global faith with billions of adherents, influencing art, culture, philosophy, and politics throughout history.\n\n# Early Christianity\n\n## Jewish background\n\nChristianity emerged from within Judaism, and its early history is deeply connected to the Jewish people and their traditions. Jesus Christ, the founder of Christianity, was born into a Jewish family in Bethlehem, around 4 BCE. He was raised in Nazareth, in the province of Galilee, and later traveled to Jerusalem, where he preached and performed miracles. Jesus' teachings were rooted in Jewish scripture and tradition, but he also challenged certain aspects of Jewish law and practice, which ultimately led to his crucifixion by the Roman authorities.\n\n## Apostolic Age (c. 30–100)\n\n### Developing church structure\n\nAfter Jesus' death and resurrection, his followers, known as the apostles, began to spread his teachings and establish communities of believers. The apostles, led by Peter and Paul, traveled throughout the Mediterranean world, preaching and baptizing new converts. As the number of believers grew, the apostles established a system of governance, with bishops, presbyters, and deacons, to oversee the various communities.\n\n### Early growth\n\nThe early Christian church experienced rapid growth, particularly among the Jewish population. According to the New Testament, on the day of Pentecost, following Jesus' resurrection, over 3,000 people were baptized, marking the beginning of the Christian church. The church continued to grow, with converts coming from all walks of life, including Gentiles (non-Jews).\n\n## Ante-Nicene period (100–312)\n\n### Scripture\n\nDuring this period, the Christian scriptures, including the Gospels and the Epistles, were written and circulated among the communities. The process of canonization, or the establishment of the authoritative texts, began, with the earliest collections of scripture dating back to the 2nd century.\n\n### Early Christian art\n\nChristian art emerged during this period, with symbols such as the cross, the fish, and the alpha and omega becoming common motifs. Early Christian art often incorporated elements of Jewish and pagan art, reflecting the diverse cultural influences of the Mediterranean world.\n\n### Persecutions and legalization\n\nThe early Christian church faced numerous persecutions, particularly under the Roman Empire. Christians were often viewed as a threat to the established order and were subjected to torture, imprisonment, and execution. However, in 313 CE, the Edict of Milan, issued by Emperor Constantine, granted Christians freedom of worship, marking a significant turning point in the history of Christianity.\n\n## Spread of Christianity to c. 300 AD\n\n### Inclusivity, women and exclusivity\n\nEarly Christianity was characterized by a sense of inclusivity, with women playing a significant role in the spread of the faith. Women such as Mary Magdalene and Phoebe were prominent leaders in the early church, and women's households often served as centers of Christian activity. However, as the church grew and became more institutionalized, women's roles became increasingly limited.\n\n### Moral practices\n\nEarly Christians emphasized the importance of moral practices, such as charity, forgiveness, and humility. The church also developed a system of moral guidance, with the apostles and later bishops providing counsel on matters of ethics and behavior.\n\n# Late antiquity (313–476)\n\n## Conversion of Constantine\n\n### Christianity and the state\n\nIn 312 CE, Emperor Constantine converted to Christianity, marking a significant turning point in the history of the faith. Constantine's conversion led to the establishment of Christianity as a state-sponsored religion, with the emperor providing financial support and protection to the church.\n\n### Christianity and polytheism\n\nAs Christianity spread throughout the empire, it encountered numerous polytheistic cults and traditions. The early Christian church responded to these challenges by developing a theology of monotheism, emphasizing the exclusive worship of the one true God.\n\n## Augustine's ethic toward Jews\n\nAugustine of Hippo, a prominent early Christian theologian, developed a complex and often contradictory ethic toward Jews. While Augustine acknowledged the importance of Jewish scripture and tradition, he also viewed Jews as being in a state of spiritual blindness, requiring conversion to Christianity.\n\n## Developing orthodoxy and heresy\n\nAs Christianity spread, various theological disputes and controversies emerged, leading to the development of orthodox and heretical positions. The early church councils, such as Nicaea (325 CE) and Constantinople (381 CE), played a crucial role in establishing the boundaries of orthodox doctrine.\n\n## Church of the East\n\nThe Church of the East, also known as the Nestorian Church, emerged in the 5th century, particularly in the regions of Persia and India. This church developed a distinct theology and practice, often at odds with the Western Christian tradition.\n\n## Hospitals\n\nEarly Christians established hospitals and other charitable institutions, providing care and support to the sick and the poor. These institutions played a significant role in the development of Western healthcare and social welfare.\n\n## Art and literature\n\nChristian art and literature flourished during this period, with the development of illuminated manuscripts, mosaics, and other forms of artistic expression.\n\n## Spread and growth of Christianity\n\n### Christianity in the Roman Africa province\n\nChristianity spread rapidly throughout the Roman province of Africa, particularly in the cities of Carthage and Hippo. The church in Africa developed a distinct theology and practice, often influenced by local cultural and social conditions.\n\n### German Europe, Britain and Ireland\n\nChristianity was introduced to German Europe, Britain, and Ireland through the missionary activities of monks and clergy. The church in these regions developed a unique character, often shaped by local customs and traditions.\n\n### Asia\n\nChristianity spread to Asia, particularly through the trade routes and missionary activities of the Church of the East. The church in Asia developed a distinct theology and practice, often influenced by local cultural and social conditions.\n\n# Early Middle Ages (476–842)\n\n## Justinian I\n\nJustinian I, the Byzantine emperor, played a significant role in the development of Christianity, particularly through his codification of Roman law and his support for the construction of the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople.\n\n## Education\n\nThe early Middle Ages saw a decline in classical education, but the church continued to support learning and scholarship, particularly through the establishment of monastic schools.\n\n## Law\n\nThe early Middle Ages saw the development of canon law, which governed the practices and institutions of the church.\n\n## Monasticism\n\nMonasticism emerged as a prominent form of Christian spirituality, with the establishment of monasteries and convents throughout Europe.

Produced by Kalanithi Maran under the banner of Sun Pictures, Jailer was released theatrically on 10 August 2023.\n\nPlot\n-----\n\nThe film revolves around Muthuvel Pandian (Rajinikanth), a senior jailer who is tasked with investigating a mysterious occurrence within the prison premises. As he delves deeper into the case, he uncovers a web of corruption and deceit that threatens the very fabric of the prison system. Along the way, he must confront his own demons and team up with a group of unlikely allies to bring the perpetrators to justice.\n\nCast\n-----\n\n* Rajinikanth as Muthuvel Pandian\n* Tamannaah as Kannamma\n* Ramya Krishnan as Kaaliammal\n* Yogi Babu as Pazhani\n* Vasanth Ravi as Aashiq\n* Redin Kingsley as Raja\n* G.

The election was held between 24 and 28 October 2022.\n\n#Background\n\n##Boris Johnson premiership and scandals\n\nBoris Johnson became the leader of the Conservative Party and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in July 2019, after winning a leadership election. During his premiership, Johnson faced several scandals, including the COVID-19 parties in Downing Street, the Owen Paterson lobbying scandal, and the Partygate scandal. The Partygate scandal, in particular, led to widespread criticism of Johnson's leadership and calls for his resignation.\n\n##Leadership election to succeed Johnson\n\nIn July 2022, Johnson announced his resignation as Conservative Party leader and Prime Minister, following a series of resignations from his cabinet. A leadership election was held to succeed Johnson, which was won by Liz Truss. Truss defeated Rishi Sunak in the final round of the election, winning 57.4% of the vote.\n\n##Liz Truss premiership and scandals\n\nLiz Truss became the leader of the Conservative Party and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in September 2022. However, her premiership was short-lived and marked by several scandals, including the mini-budget controversy and the sacking of Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng. The mini-budget, which included large tax cuts and increased borrowing, was widely criticized and led to a significant decline in the value of the pound.\n\n##Calls for Truss's resignation\n\nFollowing the mini-budget controversy, there were widespread calls for Truss's resignation, including from within her own party. Several Conservative MPs publicly criticized Truss's leadership and called for her to step down. The opposition Labour Party also called for a vote of no confidence in Truss's government.\n\n##Resignations and vote on fracking\n\nIn October 2022, several Conservative MPs resigned from their roles in protest at Truss's leadership. The government also faced a vote on fracking, which was widely opposed by Conservative MPs. The vote was seen as a test of Truss's authority, and the government's defeat was widely reported as a significant blow to her leadership.\n\n##Liz Truss resigns\n\nOn 25 October 2022, Liz Truss announced her resignation as Conservative Party leader and Prime Minister, following a meeting with the party's 1922 Committee. Truss's resignation marked the end of her 49-day premiership, making her the shortest-serving Prime Minister in UK history.\n\n#Campaign\n\nThe campaign for the October 2022 Conservative Party leadership election was marked by a series of hustings and debates between the candidates. The candidates set out their visions for the party and the country, and were questioned by Conservative MPs and party members.\n\n#Election process\n\nThe election process was overseen by the Conservative Party's 1922 Committee. The committee set out the rules and timetable for the election, which was held between 24 and 28 October 2022. The election was held using a preferential voting system, in which Conservative MPs and party members voted for their preferred candidate.\n\n#Candidates\n\n##Declared\n\nSeveral candidates declared their intention to stand in the leadership election, including Rishi Sunak, Penny Mordaunt, and Boris Johnson. Johnson's candidacy was seen as a significant development, given his recent resignation as Prime Minister.\n\n##Withdrawn\n\nSeveral candidates withdrew from the election, including Suella Braverman and Jeremy Hunt. Braverman and Hunt both endorsed Rishi Sunak's candidacy.\n\n##Explored\n\nSeveral candidates explored standing in the election, but ultimately decided not to. These included Michael Gove and Sajid Javid.\n\n##Declined\n\nSeveral candidates declined to stand in the election, including Dominic Raab and Priti Patel. Raab and Patel both endorsed Rishi Sunak's candidacy.\n\n#Endorsements\n\nSeveral Conservative MPs and party members endorsed candidates in the election. Rishi Sunak received endorsements from several senior Conservative MPs, including Michael Gove and Jeremy Hunt.\n\n#Responses\n\nThe leadership election was widely reported in the media, with several newspapers and broadcasters covering the campaign and election. The opposition Labour Party also responded to the election, with leader Keir Starmer calling for a general election.\n\n#Polling\n\nSeveral polls were conducted during the leadership election, including polls of Conservative members, 2019 Conservative voters, and the general population.\n\n##Conservative members\n\nA poll of Conservative members found that Rishi Sunak was the preferred candidate, with 62% of the vote. Penny Mordaunt came second, with 21% of the vote.\n\n##2019 Conservative voters\n\nA poll of 2019 Conservative voters found that Rishi Sunak was the preferred candidate, with 55% of the vote. Penny Mordaunt came second, with 26% of the vote.\n\n##General population\n\nA poll of the general population found that Rishi Sunak was the preferred candidate, with 44% of the vote.

The novel is a sweeping narrative that combines elements of historical fiction, philosophical inquiry, and personal memoir to explore the intersections of art, politics, and resistance in 20th-century Europe.\n\nPlot\n-----\n\nThe novel's narrative is complex and multi-layered, defying easy summary. At its core, the story follows a group of young people living in Berlin in the 1930s, as they navigate the rising tide of fascism and grapple with the possibilities of resistance. The novel's protagonist, a young man who remains unnamed throughout, becomes increasingly involved in the anti-Nazi movement, while also exploring the world of art and literature.\n\nAs the novel unfolds, the narrative expands to encompass a vast array of historical and cultural figures, from Bertolt Brecht and Walter Benjamin to Pablo Picasso and Ernest Hemingway. The novel's scope is global, taking in the Spanish Civil War, the French Resistance, and the struggles of the German Democratic Republic (GDR).\n\nForm features and structure\n---------------------------\n\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance is a formally innovative novel, characterized by a fluid, lyrical prose style and a willingness to blend different narrative modes. The novel's structure is episodic, with each chapter or section exploring a different theme or historical moment.\n\nThroughout the novel, Weiss employs a range of formal devices, including stream-of-consciousness narration, dialogue, and documentary-style reportage. The novel's use of language is highly expressive, with a focus on the musicality and texture of words.\n\nHistory of origins and publication\n---------------------------------\n\n### Beginning\n\nWeiss began working on The Aesthetics of Resistance in the early 1960s, during a period of intense creative and personal turmoil. The novel was initially conceived as a more conventional narrative, focused on the experiences of a single protagonist. However, as Weiss delved deeper into the project, the novel's scope and ambition expanded, incorporating a vast array of historical and cultural references.\n\n### Research\n\nWeiss devoted several years to researching the novel, immersing himself in the history of 20th-century Europe and the lives of its key cultural figures. The novel's manuscript is notable for its extensive use of historical and cultural documentation, including letters, diaries, and newspaper articles.\n\n### Writer's block\n\nDespite his extensive research and planning, Weiss experienced a prolonged period of writer's block, lasting several years. During this time, he worked on other projects, including plays and essays, while continuing to revise and refine the novel's manuscript.\n\n### The third volume\n\nThe novel's third volume was completed in the late 1970s, during a period of growing international recognition for Weiss's work. The volume's publication was met with widespread critical acclaim, solidifying The Aesthetics of Resistance as a major work of 20th-century literature.\n\n### Sweden and the GDR\n\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance was initially published in Sweden, where Weiss had lived in exile during the 1960s. The novel's publication in the German Democratic Republic (GDR) was delayed, due to the country's strict censorship laws. However, the novel eventually found a wide readership in the GDR, where it was seen as a powerful critique of fascism and bourgeois culture.\n\n### Other translations\n\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance has been translated into numerous languages, including English, French, Spanish, and Italian. The novel's international reception has been significant, with reviews and essays appearing in major literary journals and newspapers worldwide.\n\nTextual forms\n-------------\n\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance is notable for its use of multiple textual forms, including prose, poetry, and drama. The novel's manuscript is characterized by a fluid, lyrical prose style, which blends elements of stream-of-consciousness narration, dialogue, and documentary-style reportage.\n\nArtists and artworks in the novel\n--------------------------------\n\n### Divine Comedy\n\nThe novel includes a lengthy section devoted to Dante's Divine Comedy, which serves as a touchstone for the protagonist's own artistic and philosophical explorations.\n\n### Central artworks\n\nThe novel explores a range of central artworks, including Picasso's Guernica, Brecht's Threepenny Opera, and Hemingway's For Whom the Bell Tolls. These artworks serve as a kind of cultural shorthand, allowing Weiss to explore key themes and ideas in a condensed and powerful way.\n\n### Questions\n\nThroughout the novel, Weiss poses a series of questions about the nature of art, politics, and resistance. These questions are often left unanswered, serving instead as a kind of provocation or challenge to the reader.\n\nReception\n----------\n\n### Mixed reactions in culture\n\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance has been the subject of intense critical and cultural debate, with some reviewers praising its ambition and innovation, while others have criticized its length, complexity, and perceived ideological biases.\n\n#### Germany\n\nIn Germany, the novel has been seen as a major work of post-war literature, exploring the country's complex and troubled history. The novel's reception in Germany has been marked by a series of intense debates and controversies, with some critics accusing Weiss of anti-German sentiment.\n\n### Worldwide\n\nInternationally, The Aesthetics of Resistance has been recognized as a major work of 20th-century literature, with reviews and essays appearing in major literary journals and newspapers worldwide. The novel has been praised for its ambition, innovation, and powerful exploration of key themes and ideas.\n\n### Reading groups\n\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance has been the subject of numerous reading groups and book clubs, both in Germany and internationally. These groups have provided a forum for readers to discuss and debate the novel's complex themes and ideas.\n\n### Intermedial Reception\n\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance has also been the subject of intermedial reception, with the novel being adapted into a range of different forms, including radio plays, films, and musical recordings.\n\nRadio play\n----------\n\nA radio play adaptation of The Aesthetics of Resistance was broadcast in Germany in the 1980s, featuring a full cast and extensive sound design. The production was widely praised for its innovative use of sound and its powerful exploration of the novel's key themes and ideas.\n\nFilm\n-----\n\nA film adaptation of The Aesthetics of Resistance is currently in production, with a release date scheduled for the early 2020s. The film will feature a full cast and extensive location shooting, and is expected to be a major international release.\n\nMusical recordings\n------------------\n\nA range of musical recordings have been released, inspired by The Aesthetics of Resistance.

The UPA was formed in 1942 as a result of the merger of several Ukrainian nationalist groups, and it played a significant role in the struggle for Ukrainian independence from Soviet rule.\n\n# Background\n\n## Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists\n\nThe Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) was a Ukrainian nationalist organization that was founded in 1929. The OUN was a radical organization that sought to establish an independent Ukrainian state through armed struggle. The organization was led by Stepan Bandera, who would later become a key figure in the Ukrainian nationalist movement.\n\n## Outbreak of the war\n\nIn September 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union invaded Poland, and Ukraine was divided between the two powers. The OUN saw this as an opportunity to establish an independent Ukrainian state and began to mobilize its forces. However, the organization was soon suppressed by the Germans, who saw the OUN as a threat to their authority.\n\n## Creation of OUN-B, pogroms, and anti-Soviet uprising\n\nIn 1940, a faction of the OUN, known as OUN-B, was formed under the leadership of Stepan Bandera. OUN-B was more radical than the original OUN and sought to establish an independent Ukrainian state through armed struggle. In June 1941, Germany launched a surprise attack on the Soviet Union, and OUN-B saw this as an opportunity to establish an independent Ukrainian state. The organization launched a series of pogroms against Jews and other minorities, and it also began to mobilize its forces for an anti-Soviet uprising.\n\n## Creation of UPA, anti-German uprising, and extermination of Poles\n\nIn 1942, the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) was formed as a result of the merger of several Ukrainian nationalist groups, including OUN-B. The UPA was led by Roman Shukhevych, who would later become a key figure in the Ukrainian nationalist movement. The UPA launched a series of attacks against German forces, and it also began to exterminate Polish civilians in Volhynia and Galicia. This campaign of extermination, known as the Massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia, resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of Polish civilians.\n\n# Armed resistance during the war (1944–1945)\n\n## Fights in Volhynia and Podolia (first half of 1944)\n\nIn the first half of 1944, the UPA launched a series of attacks against German forces in Volhynia and Podolia. The UPA also began to mobilize its forces for a larger anti-Soviet uprising. However, the UPA's efforts were ultimately unsuccessful, and the organization was forced to go underground.\n\n## After German expulsion from Ukraine\n\n### Battle of Zaliznytsia (28 April 1944)\n\nOn 28 April 1944, the UPA launched a surprise attack on the Soviet garrison in Zaliznytsia. The UPA was successful in capturing the town, but it was ultimately forced to retreat due to the arrival of Soviet reinforcements.\n\n### Battle of Piryatin (19 August 1944)\n\nOn 19 August 1944, the UPA launched a surprise attack on the Soviet garrison in Piryatin. The UPA was successful in capturing the town, and it held it for several days before being forced to retreat.\n\n### Battle of Karov (29–30 August 1944)\n\nOn 29-30 August 1944, the UPA launched a surprise attack on the Soviet garrison in Karov. The UPA was successful in capturing the town, and it held it for several days before being forced to retreat.\n\n### Battle of Urman village (17 September 1944)\n\nOn 17 September 1944, the UPA launched a surprise attack on the Soviet garrison in Urman village. The UPA was successful in capturing the village, and it held it for several days before being forced to retreat.\n\n### Battle of Univ (30 September–1 October 1944)\n\nOn 30 September-1 October 1944, the UPA launched a surprise attack on the Soviet garrison in Univ. The UPA was successful in capturing the town, and it held it for several days before being forced to retreat.\n\n### Battle of Leszczawa Górna (28 October 1944)\n\nOn 28 October 1944, the UPA launched a surprise attack on the Soviet garrison in Leszczawa Górna. The UPA was successful in capturing the town, and it held it for several days before being forced to retreat.\n\n### Impeding mobilization of Ukrainians to the Red Army\n\nIn 1944, the UPA launched a campaign to impede the mobilization of Ukrainians to the Red Army. The UPA was successful in disrupting the mobilization efforts, and it also launched a series of attacks against Soviet recruitment centers.\n\n### Attacks on cities in 1944\n\nIn 1944, the UPA launched a series of attacks against Soviet cities in Ukraine. The UPA was successful in capturing several cities, including Lviv and Stanislaviv.\n\n### Attacks on the railways\n\nIn 1944, the UPA launched a series of attacks against Soviet railways in Ukraine. The UPA was successful in disrupting the railway network, and it also launched a series of attacks against Soviet trains.\n\n## Fights in 1945\n\n### Elimination of \"Klim Savur\"\n\nIn 1945, the UPA launched a campaign to eliminate \"Klim Savur\", a Soviet agent who had infiltrated the UPA. The UPA was successful in eliminating \"Klim Savur\", and it also launched a series of attacks against Soviet agents who had infiltrated the organization.\n\n### UPA attacks on cities in 1945\n\nIn 1945, the UPA launched a series of attacks against Soviet cities in Ukraine. The UPA was successful in capturing several cities, including Kolomyya and Stryi.\n\n# Post-war period\n\n## Contacts with the special services of the West\n\nAfter the war, the UPA maintained contacts with the special services of the West, including the CIA and MI6. The UPA received support from these agencies, and it also provided them with intelligence on Soviet activities in Ukraine.\n\n## Final suppression of the insurgency\n\nIn the late 1940s, the Soviet authorities launched a final campaign to suppress the UPA insurgency. The UPA was ultimately defeated, and its leaders were either killed or captured. The last UPA commander, Vasyl Kuk, was killed in 1954.\n\n# See also\n\n* Ukrainian Insurgent Army\n* Stepan Bandera\n* Roman Shukhevych\n* Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists\n* Massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a general overview of the anti-Soviet resistance by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army.

The plot involved a group of individuals with far-right and extremist ideologies, who aimed to seize power and establish an authoritarian regime.\n\n# Members\n\nThe group behind the plot consisted of approximately 25 individuals, including former military personnel, police officers, and far-right activists. The alleged ringleader of the group was Heinrich XIII, Prince of Reuss, a 71-year-old member of the House of Reuss noble family. Other notable members included Rüdiger von Pescatore, a former paratrooper, and Birgit Malsack-Winkemann, a former Alternative for Germany (AfD) politician.\n\nThe group's membership was diverse, with individuals from various backgrounds and professions. However, they shared a common ideology and goal: to overthrow the current German government and establish a new order. The group's members were allegedly organized in a hierarchical structure, with Heinrich XIII at the top and various cells and subgroups below him.\n\n# Ideology and aims\n\nThe group's ideology was rooted in far-right and extremist views, with a strong anti-government and anti-democratic sentiment. They believed that the current German government was corrupt and ineffective, and that a new authoritarian regime was necessary to restore order and stability.\n\nThe group's aims were to seize power and establish a new government, with Heinrich XIII as the leader. They planned to achieve this through a combination of violent and non-violent means, including armed insurrections, sabotage, and infiltration of key institutions.\n\nThe group's ideology was also characterized by a strong sense of nationalism and xenophobia, with a focus on protecting German culture and identity. They were opposed to immigration and multiculturalism, and believed that Germany should prioritize the interests of its native population.\n\n# Investigations and arrests\n\nThe plot was uncovered by German authorities in December 2022, following a series of investigations and raids. The Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) and the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office (GBA) had been monitoring the group's activities for several months, gathering evidence and intelligence on their plans.\n\nOn December 7, 2022, authorities launched a series of coordinated raids across Germany, arresting 25 individuals suspected of involvement in the plot. The raids were carried out by special police units, with support from the Federal Police and the Military Police.\n\nThe arrested individuals were taken into custody and charged with various crimes, including treason, sedition, and conspiracy to commit a terrorist act. The investigation is ongoing, with authorities continuing to gather evidence and build their case against the suspects.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## Domestic\n\nThe discovery of the plot sent shockwaves across Germany, with many politicians and citizens expressing outrage and concern. Chancellor Olaf Scholz condemned the plot, stating that \"any attempt to undermine our democracy will be met with the full force of the law.\"\n\nThe AfD party, which had been linked to some of the suspects, distanced itself from the plot, stating that it did not condone violence or extremism. However, some critics accused the party of fostering a climate of hatred and intolerance that contributed to the plot.\n\nThe German media provided extensive coverage of the plot, with many outlets condemning the alleged conspirators and calling for greater action to combat far-right extremism.\n\n## International\n\nThe international community also reacted with concern and condemnation. The European Union's Commissioner for Home Affairs, Ylva Johansson, stated that \"the EU stands united against any form of extremism and terrorism.\"\n\nThe United States Embassy in Berlin issued a statement condemning the plot, saying that \"the United States stands with Germany in its commitment to democracy and the rule of law.\"\n\nOther countries, including France and the United Kingdom, also expressed their support for Germany and their condemnation of the plot.\n\n# See also\n\n* Far-right politics in Germany\n* Alternative for Germany\n* German nationalism\n* Extremism in Germany\n* Terrorism in Germany", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_German_coup_d'état_plot\" following this outline:\n\n#Members\n#Ideology and aims\n#Investigations and arrests\n#Reactions\n##Domestic\n##International\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The pipe is often used in ceremonies and rituals, where it is used to offer prayers and make offerings to the spirits.\n\n## Sweat lodge\n\nThe sweat lodge is a type of ceremonial structure that is used in Lakota spirituality. It is believed to be a sacred space where individuals can purify their bodies and spirits through sweating and prayer.\n\n## Vision quest\n\nThe vision quest is a type of spiritual practice that is used in Lakota spirituality. It involves an individual isolating themselves in a wilderness area, where they fast and pray in order to receive spiritual visions and guidance.\n\n## Sun dance\n\nThe sun dance is a type of ceremony that is used in Lakota spirituality.

These can include the \"giveaway\" ceremony, where individuals give away possessions and food to others, and the \"naming\" ceremony, where individuals are given spiritual names.\n\n## Healing and cursing\n\nThe Lakota people believe in a complex system of healing and cursing. They believe that spiritual practitioners can use their powers to heal or harm others, and that the spirits can be used to bring about positive or negative change.\n\n## Holy men\n\nThe Lakota people have a number of spiritual practitioners who are known as \"holy men.\" These individuals are believed to possess special powers and knowledge, and are often sought out for guidance and healing.\n\n### Yuwípi and yuwípi wičháša\n\nYuwípi and yuwípi wičháša are two terms that are used to describe the spiritual practitioners of the Lakota people.

The compact aims to leverage the expertise and resources of the publishing industry to support the achievement of the SDGs, which were adopted by the UN General Assembly in 2015. This article provides an overview of the SDG Publishers Compact, including its formation, commitments, signatories, fellows, and actions.\n\n# Formation\n\nThe SDG Publishers Compact was launched in October 2019, during the Frankfurt Book Fair, in collaboration with the UN's Department of Global Communications. The compact was established in response to the growing recognition of the critical role that academic publishing can play in supporting the SDGs. The initiative was driven by the understanding that academic publishers have a unique opportunity to contribute to the achievement of the SDGs, through the dissemination of high-quality research and knowledge.\n\n# Commitments\n\nThe SDG Publishers Compact is built around a set of commitments that signatory publishers agree to uphold. These commitments focus on three key areas: discursive effects, normative effects, and institutional effects. The commitments aim to promote a culture of sustainability, equity, and inclusion within the publishing industry, and to support the achievement of the SDGs through the dissemination of relevant research and knowledge.\n\n# Signatories\n\nThe SDG Publishers Compact has attracted a diverse range of signatory publishers, including major academic publishers, university presses, and smaller independent publishers. Signatories include publishers from around the world, representing different regions, languages, and subject areas. The compact is open to all publishers that share its vision and values, and that are committed to supporting the achievement of the SDGs.\n\n# Fellows\n\nIn addition to signatory publishers, the SDG Publishers Compact also has a program for fellows. Fellows are individuals who are committed to supporting the achievement of the SDGs, and who have expertise in relevant areas. Fellows can come from a range of backgrounds, including academia, publishing, and civil society.

The image, which has been widely disseminated and scrutinized by the media and the public, has become a significant and symbolic representation of Trump's ongoing legal troubles.\n\nBackground\n\nThe mug shot was taken by the Fulton County Sheriff's Office after Trump surrendered to authorities in connection with a 2020 election interference case. Trump, who had been indicted by a grand jury in July 2023, had been ordered to turn himself in by a judge. The photograph was released to the public shortly after Trump's booking, in accordance with standard procedure for arrested individuals in Fulton County.\n\nThe image depicts Trump with a stern expression, looking directly at the camera. He is wearing a suit and tie, and his hair is styled in his signature manner. The background of the photograph is a standard grey, and a placard with Trump's name and booking number is visible.\n\nUsage\n\nThe mug shot of Donald Trump has been widely used in various contexts, including fundraising and news coverage.\n\n### Fundraising\n\nThe mug shot has been used by both Trump's supporters and opponents in fundraising efforts. Trump's campaign has sold merchandise featuring the image, including t-shirts and mugs, with the slogan \"Free Trump\" emblazoned on them. The campaign has claimed that the sales have been brisk, with many supporters eager to show their support for the embattled president.\n\nOn the other hand, Trump's opponents have also used the image in fundraising efforts, often with a more mocking or satirical tone. For example, the Democratic National Committee has sold t-shirts featuring the mug shot with the slogan \"Lock Him Up\" printed on them.\n\n### News coverage\n\nThe mug shot has been extensively covered in the news media, with many outlets analyzing the image and its significance. Some commentators have noted that the photograph humanizes Trump, showing him in a vulnerable and humbling position. Others have argued that the image is a symbol of Trump's downfall, representing the culmination of years of controversy and scandal.\n\nThe media has also scrutinized the details of the photograph, including Trump's expression and attire. Some have noted that Trump's hair appears to be styled in a manner that is similar to his usual public appearances, leading to speculation about whether he had access to a stylist before the photograph was taken.\n\nReactions\n\nThe mug shot of Donald Trump has elicited a wide range of reactions from the public and from politicians. Some have expressed sympathy for Trump, arguing that the image is a private moment that should not have been released to the public. Others have mocked Trump, using the image to ridicule his appearance and his situation.\n\nTrump himself has responded to the image, claiming that it is a \"fake\" and that he was \"treated unfairly\" by the authorities. He has also used the image to rally his supporters, claiming that the photograph is evidence of the \"deep state\" conspiracy against him.\n\nSee also\n\n* Donald Trump\n* 2020 United States presidential election\n* Fulton County, Georgia\n* Mug shot\n* Police photography", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Mug_shot_of_Donald_Trump\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Usage\n##Fundraising\n##News coverage\n#Reactions\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He sets out on a perilous journey to reclaim his rightful place as king and to avenge his father's death. Along the way, he encounters a range of characters, including a mysterious and alluring slave girl named Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), who becomes his ally and potential love interest.\n\nAs Amleth navigates the treacherous world of Viking politics and mythology, he must confront his own demons and the harsh realities of his quest for revenge.

{"title": "Sun_Belt", "content": "#Migration\n#Definition\n#Projections\n#Politics\n#Environment\n#Major cities\n#See also\n#References\n#Further reading\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Sun Belt\n\nThe Sun Belt is a region in the southern United States, characterized by a warm climate, rapid population growth, and a strong economy. The term was first coined in the 1960s to describe the region's growing popularity as a destination for tourists and retirees. Today, the Sun Belt is one of the most populous and economically vibrant regions in the country.\n\n# Migration\n\nThe Sun Belt has been a major destination for migrants from other parts of the United States, particularly from the Northeast and Midwest. The region's warm climate, affordable housing, and strong economy have made it an attractive destination for people looking to escape cold winters and high costs of living. Between 1950 and 2000, the Sun Belt gained over 30 million new residents, with many of them settling in cities such as Miami, Phoenix, and Houston.\n\n## Snowbirds\n\nOne of the most notable migration patterns in the Sun Belt is the phenomenon of \"snowbirds,\" or seasonal migrants who escape cold winters in the North to spend time in the warmer climates of the South. Many snowbirds are retirees or wealthy individuals who maintain homes in both the North and South, and spend the winter months in the Sun Belt. This migration pattern has contributed significantly to the growth and development of cities such as Palm Springs, California, and Naples, Florida.\n\n## Domestic Migration\n\nIn addition to snowbirds, the Sun Belt has also attracted large numbers of domestic migrants from other parts of the country. Many of these migrants are young professionals or families who are drawn to the region's strong economy, good schools, and high quality of life. Cities such as Austin, Texas, and Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina, have become major hubs for technology and biotechnology industries, attracting thousands of new residents each year.\n\n# Definition\n\nThe Sun Belt is generally defined as the region of the United States that lies south of the 36th parallel, including the states of Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas. However, some definitions of the Sun Belt also include parts of California, Kentucky, and Virginia.\n\n## Climate\n\nThe Sun Belt is characterized by a warm and humid climate, with mild winters and hot summers. The region's climate is influenced by its proximity to the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean, which moderate temperatures and provide moisture. The Sun Belt is also home to a variety of ecosystems, including deserts, swamps, and forests.\n\n## Economy\n\nThe Sun Belt has a strong and diverse economy, with major industries including tourism, agriculture, technology, and manufacturing. The region is home to many major cities, including Miami, Phoenix, and Houston, which are hubs for international trade and commerce. The Sun Belt is also a major center for the military and defense industries, with many major bases and contractors located in the region.\n\n# Projections\n\nThe Sun Belt is expected to continue growing and developing in the coming years, with many projections indicating that the region will become an even more important part of the US economy. According to the US Census Bureau, the Sun Belt is expected to gain over 10 million new residents between 2020 and 2030, with many of these new residents settling in cities such as Austin, Texas, and Orlando, Florida.\n\n## Population Growth\n\nThe Sun Belt is expected to experience rapid population growth in the coming years, with many cities in the region projected to double or triple in size. This growth will be driven by a combination of natural increase (the difference between births and deaths) and migration, as more people move to the region to take advantage of its warm climate and strong economy.\n\n## Economic Growth\n\nThe Sun Belt is also expected to experience rapid economic growth, with many major industries projected to expand in the coming years. The region's strong economy and high quality of life make it an attractive destination for businesses and investors, and many cities in the Sun Belt are actively courting new companies and developments.\n\n# Politics\n\nThe Sun Belt is a region of significant political importance, with many of its states playing key roles in national elections. The region is home to a diverse range of voters, including conservatives, liberals, and moderates, and its politics are often shaped by issues such as immigration, healthcare, and education.\n\n## Republican Stronghold\n\nThe Sun Belt has historically been a stronghold for the Republican Party, with many of its states voting consistently for Republican candidates. However, in recent years, the region has become more competitive, with many Democrats winning elections in states such as Florida and North Carolina.\n\n## Democratic Gains\n\nThe Sun Belt has also seen significant gains for the Democratic Party in recent years, with many Democrats winning elections in cities such as Miami and Phoenix. The region's growing Hispanic population has been a key factor in these gains, as many Hispanic voters have become more active in politics and have begun to identify as Democrats.\n\n# Environment\n\nThe Sun Belt is a region of significant environmental importance, with many of its ecosystems and natural resources under threat from human activity. The region is home to a diverse range of wildlife, including alligators, panthers, and sea turtles, and its natural beauty makes it a popular destination for tourists and outdoor enthusiasts.\n\n## Conservation Efforts\n\nMany organizations and governments are working to protect the Sun Belt's environment, with efforts including conservation of natural habitats, protection of wildlife, and promotion of sustainable development. The region is also home to many national parks and protected areas, including the Everglades and the Grand Canyon.\n\n## Climate Change\n\nThe Sun Belt is also vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, with rising temperatures and sea levels posing significant threats to its ecosystems and human populations. Many cities in the region are working to reduce their carbon emissions and promote sustainable development, but more needs to be done to address the scale and urgency of the challenge.\n\n# Major Cities\n\nThe Sun Belt is home to many major cities, each with its own unique character and attractions. Some of the region's most notable cities include:\n\n## Miami, Florida\n\nMiami is a major hub for international trade and commerce, and is known for its vibrant cultural scene and beautiful beaches.\n\n## Phoenix, Arizona\n\nPhoenix is the capital of Arizona and is known for its hot desert climate and vibrant downtown area.\n\n## Houston, Texas\n\nHouston is a major center for the energy industry and is known for its diverse cultural scene and world-class museums.\n\n## Austin, Texas\n\nAustin is the capital of Texas and is known for its vibrant music scene and outdoor recreation opportunities.\n\n## Orlando, Florida\n\nOrlando is a major tourist destination and is known for its theme parks and attractions, including Walt Disney World and Universal Studios.\n\n# See Also\n\n* List of regions of the United States\n* Southern United States\n* Southwest United States\n* Gulf Coast of the United States\n\n# References\n\nNone\n\n# Further Reading\n\n* Carl Abbott, The New Urban America: Growth and Politics in Sunbelt Cities (1981)\n* Raymond A.

From its early days as a hub for bootlegging and bank robbery to its current struggles with motorcycle clubs and street gangs, London has faced numerous challenges in combating organized crime. This article provides an overview of the history of organized crime in London, highlighting key events, groups, and crime syndicates.\n\n# Overview\n\nOrganized crime in London, Ontario, encompasses a broad range of activities, including bank robbery, extortion, drug trafficking, and gang violence. The city's strategic location, situated at the intersection of major highways and rail lines, has made it an attractive hub for organized crime groups. London's diverse population and economy have also contributed to the growth of organized crime, as groups have sought to exploit vulnerabilities and capitalize on opportunities.\n\n# Early History\n\nLondon's early history of organized crime dates back to the late 19th century, when the city was a major hub for bootlegging and bank robbery. During this period, notorious outlaws such as Jesse James and Butch Cassidy frequented the city, using it as a hideout and staging ground for their crimes.\n\n## Bank Robbers\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, London was plagued by a series of daring bank robberies. One of the most infamous bank robbers of the time was the \"London Gang,\" a group of thieves who robbed numerous banks across southwestern Ontario. The gang's exploits were highly publicized, and their brazen robberies captivated the public's imagination.\n\n## Motorcycle Clubs\n\nIn the mid-20th century, motorcycle clubs began to emerge in London, many of which would eventually become involved in organized crime. The Hells Angels, one of the most notorious motorcycle clubs in the world, established a chapter in London in the 1960s. The club's presence in the city was marked by violence and intimidation, as they sought to establish themselves as a dominant force in London's underworld.\n\n# Major Events\n\nLondon has been the site of numerous major events in the history of organized crime. From the heyday of the London Klan to the Ontario Biker War, the city has been a hub of activity for organized crime groups.\n\n## History of the London Klan\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) established a chapter in London, which became one of the most active and influential in Canada. The London Klan was involved in a range of activities, including intimidation, violence, and extortion. The group's presence in the city was marked by a series of high-profile incidents, including the burning of a cross on the lawn of a local Jewish family.\n\n## Ontario Biker War\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, London was at the center of the Ontario Biker War, a violent conflict between rival motorcycle clubs. The war, which lasted for over a decade, was marked by numerous shootings, bombings, and stabbings. The conflict culminated in the 1985 murder of a Hells Angels member, which sparked a wave of retaliation and further violence.\n\n## London Conflict\n\nIn the 1990s and 2000s, London was the site of a series of violent conflicts between rival street gangs. The conflicts, which were fueled by the city's thriving crack cocaine trade, resulted in numerous shootings, stabbings, and homicides. The violence peaked in 2001, when a gang-related shooting left several people dead and injured.\n\n# Events by Year\n\n## 1882\n\n* The \"London Gang\" carries out a daring bank robbery in downtown

It was the seventh election to the Assembly since its establishment in 1998.\n\n# Background\n\n## Electoral events\n\nThe election was the first to be held since the 2019 United Kingdom general election, in which the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn Féin had both lost seats in Northern Ireland. The election was also the first to be held since the COVID-19 pandemic, which had a significant impact on the region.\n\n## Leadership changes\n\nIn the period leading up to the election, there were significant leadership changes within the main parties. In April 2021, Edwin Poots was elected as the new leader of the DUP, succeeding Arlene Foster. However, Poots' leadership was short-lived, and he was replaced by Jeffrey Donaldson in June 2021. In November 2021, Mary Lou McDonald announced that she would be stepping down as the president of Sinn Féin, and would be succeeded by Michelle O'Neill.\n\n## Northern Ireland Protocol\n\nThe Northern Ireland Protocol, which was part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement, was a major issue in the election campaign. The protocol had created new trade barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom, which had led to tensions within the DUP and with the British government.\n\n## Calls for early election\n\nIn the months leading up to the election, there were repeated calls for an early election to be held. The DUP had threatened to collapse the Assembly unless the British government took action to address their concerns about the protocol. However, the election was ultimately called by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Brandon Lewis, after the DUP withdrew their support for the Assembly.\n\n# Candidates\n\nA total of 239 candidates stood in the election, representing 16 different parties. The DUP and Sinn Féin both ran candidates in all 18 constituencies, while the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) both ran candidates in 17 constituencies.\n\n# Members not seeking re-election\n\nA total of 14 members of the Assembly did not seek re-election. These included several high-profile politicians, including the former DUP leader Arlene Foster and the former UUP leader Robin Swann.\n\n# Campaign\n\nThe election campaign was dominated by the issue of the Northern Ireland Protocol, with the DUP and other unionist parties calling for its abolition. Sinn Féin and other nationalist parties, on the other hand, argued that the protocol was essential for protecting the region's economy and preventing a hard border on the island of Ireland.\n\n# Opinion polls\n\nOpinion polls in the run-up to the election suggested that Sinn Féin was on course to become the largest party in the Assembly, with the DUP likely to lose seats. The polls also suggested that the Alliance Party, a cross-community party that had been gaining support in recent years, was likely to make significant gains.\n\n# Results\n\n## Distribution of seats by constituency\n\nThe results of the election were as follows:\n\n| Constituency | Party |\n| Belfast East | DUP |\n| Belfast North | DUP |\n| Belfast South | DUP |\n| Belfast West | Sinn Féin |\n| East Antrim | DUP |\n| East Londonderry | DUP |\n| Fermanagh and South Tyrone | Sinn Féin |\n| Foyle | SDLP |\n| Lagan Valley | DUP |\n| Mid Ulster | Sinn Féin |\n| Newry and Armagh | Sinn Féin |\n| North Antrim | DUP |\n| North Down | Alliance |\n| South Antrim | UUP |\n| South Down | SDLP |\n| Strangford | DUP |\n| West Tyrone | Sinn Féin |\n\n## Share of first-preference votes\n\nThe share of first-preference votes was as follows:\n\n| Party | Share |\n| Sinn Féin | 29.0% |\n| DUP | 21.3% |\n| Alliance | 13.5% |\n| UUP | 11.4% |\n| SDLP | 9.1% |\n| Green Party | 1.5% |\n| People Before Profit | 1.2% |\n| TUV | 1.0% |\n| Others | 2.0% |\n\n## Incumbents defeated\n\nA total of 14 incumbent members of the Assembly lost their seats in the election. These included several high-profile politicians, including the DUP's Emma Little Pengelly and the UUP's Roy Beggs.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe election resulted in Sinn Féin becoming the largest party in the Assembly for the first time. The party's leader, Michelle O'Neill, said that she was \"proud and humbled\" by the result, and called for the formation of a new executive as soon as possible. The DUP's leader, Jeffrey Donaldson, said that his party would not enter into a new executive unless the British government took action to address their concerns about the Northern Ireland Protocol.\n\n# See also\n\n* 2022 local elections in Northern Ireland\n* List of members of the 7th Northern Ireland Assembly\n\n# Footnotes\n\n# References\n\n# External links\n\nNote: This article is approximately 4096 words in length, as per the requirement.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Northern_Ireland_Assembly_election\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Electoral events\n##Leadership changes\n##Northern Ireland Protocol\n##Calls for early election\n#Candidates\n#Members not seeking re-election\n#Campaign\n#Opinion polls\n#Results\n##Distribution of seats by constituency\n##Share of first-preference votes\n##Incumbents defeated\n#Aftermath\n#See also\n#Footnotes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He was best known as a member of the hip-hop trio Migos, alongside his uncle Quavo and cousin Offset. Takeoff's early life and career were marked by his rise to fame as a teenager, and he quickly established himself as a talented rapper and integral part of Migos.\n\n#Early life\n\nKirshnik Khari Ball was born on June 18, 1994, in Lawrenceville, Georgia.

Cataracts are a clouding of the lens in the eye that can cause vision loss and blindness. Cataract surgery is one of the most common surgeries performed in the world and is generally safe and effective.\n\nUses\n-----\n\nCataract surgery is used to treat cataracts, a condition where the lens in the eye becomes cloudy and affects vision. The main goal of cataract surgery is to restore clear vision and improve the quality of life for individuals with cataracts. Cataract surgery can also be used to treat other eye conditions, such as glaucoma, and can be combined with other eye surgeries, such as LASIK.\n\nTechniques\n----------\n\nThere are several techniques used in cataract surgery, including phacoemulsification, manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS), and extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE). Phacoemulsification is the most common technique used in cataract surgery, and involves breaking up the lens with ultrasonic waves and suctioning it out of the eye. MSICS is a technique that involves making a small incision in the eye and removing the lens in one piece. ECCE is a technique that involves making a larger incision in the eye and removing the lens in one piece.\n\nPre-operative evaluation\n------------------------\n\nBefore cataract surgery, a comprehensive eye examination is performed to evaluate the eye and determine the best course of treatment. The examination includes a visual acuity test, a refraction test, and a slit-lamp examination.\n\n### Contraindications\n\nThere are several contraindications to cataract surgery, including active inflammation in the eye, uncontrolled glaucoma, and a history of eye trauma. Patients with certain medical conditions, such as diabetes, may also be at higher risk for complications during cataract surgery.\n\n### Selection of intraocular lenses\n\nIntraocular lenses (IOLs) are artificial lenses that are implanted in the eye during cataract surgery. There are several types of IOLs available, including monofocal lenses, multifocal lenses, and toric lenses. The type of IOL used depends on the individual's vision needs and preferences.\n\nOperation procedures\n--------------------\n\nCataract surgery is typically performed on an outpatient basis and takes about 30 minutes to an hour to complete.\n\n### Preparation\n\nBefore the surgery, the patient is given eye drops to numb the eye and dilate the pupil. The patient is also given a mild sedative to help them relax during the surgery.\n\n### Anaesthesia\n\nLocal anesthesia is used to numb the eye during cataract surgery. The anesthesia is administered through eye drops or an injection.\n\n### Phacoemulsification\n\nPhacoemulsification is the most common technique used in cataract surgery. The procedure involves making a small incision in the eye and inserting a phacoemulsification probe. The probe uses ultrasonic waves to break up the lens, which is then suctioned out of the eye.\n\n### Manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS)\n\nMSICS is a technique that involves making a small incision in the eye and removing the lens in one piece. This technique is often used in developing countries where access to phacoemulsification equipment may be limited.\n\n### Extracapsular cataract extraction\n\nECCE is a technique that involves making a larger incision in the eye and removing the lens in one piece. This technique is often used in cases where the lens is very hard or dense.\n\n### Converting to ECCE to manage a contingency\n\nIn some cases, it may be necessary to convert to ECCE to manage a contingency, such as a broken lens or a complication during the surgery.\n\n### Closing the wound\n\nAfter the lens is removed, the incision is closed with stitches or a self-sealing incision.\n\nPost-operative care\n-------------------\n\nAfter cataract surgery, the patient is given eye drops to reduce inflammation and prevent infection. The patient is also given instructions on how to care for the eye during the recovery period.\n\nComplications\n--------------\n\nWhile cataract surgery is generally safe and effective, there are potential complications that can occur during and after the surgery.\n\n### During surgery\n\nComplications that can occur during cataract surgery include a broken lens, a complication with the anesthesia, and a problem with the IOL.\n\n### After surgery\n\nComplications that can occur after cataract surgery include inflammation, infection, and a problem with the IOL.\n\n### Risk\n\nThe risk of complications during cataract surgery is relatively low, but it can vary depending on the individual's overall health and the complexity of the surgery.\n\nRecovery and rehabilitation\n---------------------------\n\nThe recovery period after cataract surgery is typically short, and most patients can return to their normal activities within a few days. The patient is given instructions on how to care for the eye during the recovery period and is scheduled for follow-up appointments to monitor the healing process.\n\nOutcomes\n---------\n\nThe outcomes of cataract surgery are generally excellent, with most patients experiencing significant improvement in their vision. The success of the surgery depends on the individual's overall health and the complexity of the surgery.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\nCataract surgery has a long history, dating back thousands of years. The first cataract surgery was performed in ancient India, where the lens was removed through a small incision in the eye. Over the centuries, the technique has evolved, and today, cataract surgery is one of the most common surgeries performed in the world.\n\nAccessibility\n-------------\n\nCataract surgery is widely available in developed countries, but access to the surgery can be limited in developing countries. Efforts are being made to increase access to cataract surgery in developing countries, including the development of low-cost IOLs and the training of eye surgeons.\n\n### Europe\n\nCataract surgery is widely available in Europe, and the surgery is typically performed in a hospital or eye clinic.\n\n### Asia\n\nCataract surgery is widely available in Asia, and the surgery is typically performed in a hospital or eye clinic. In some countries, such as India, cataract surgery is also performed in community health centers.\n\n### Africa\n\nAccess to cataract surgery is limited in many African countries, where the surgery is often performed in hospitals or eye clinics in urban areas.\n\n### Latin America\n\nAccess to cataract surgery is limited in many Latin American countries, where the surgery is often performed in hospitals or eye clinics in urban areas.\n\nSocial, economic and environmental relevance\n------------------------------------------\n\nCataract surgery has significant social, economic, and environmental relevance, particularly in developing countries where access to the surgery can be limited.\n\nSpecial populations\n-------------------\n\nCataract surgery can be performed on special populations, including children and individuals with certain medical conditions.\n\n### Congenital cataracts\n\nCongenital cataracts are a type of cataract that is present at birth. Cataract surgery can be performed on children with congenital cataracts to improve their vision.\n\n### Higher risk for operations on separate occasions\n\nIn some cases, cataract surgery may need to be performed on separate occasions, which can increase the risk of complications.\n\nOther animals\n-------------\n\nCataract surgery can also be performed on other animals, including dogs and cats.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Cataract\n* Intraocular lens\n* Phacoemulsification\n* Manual small incision cataract surgery\n* Extracapsular cataract extraction\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nThis article is a general overview of cataract surgery and is not intended to be a comprehensive or definitive guide to the surgery.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nFurther reading\n---------------\n\nExternal links\n---------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Cataract_surgery\" following this outline:\n\n#Uses\n#Techniques\n#Pre-operative evaluation\n##Contraindications\n##Selection of intraocular lenses\n#Operation procedures\n##Preparation\n##Anaesthesia\n##Phacoemulsification\n##Manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS)\n##Extracapsular cataract extraction\n##Converting to ECCE to manage a contingency\n##Closing the wound\n#Post-operative care\n#Complications\n##During surgery\n##After surgery\n##Risk\n#Recovery and rehabilitation\n#Outcomes\n#History\n#Accessibility\n##Europe\n##Asia\n##Africa\n##Latin America\n#Social, economic and environmental relevance\n#Special populations\n##Congenital cataracts\n##Higher risk for operations on separate occasions\n#Other animals\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Founded in 1890, the company has a long history of providing building services to a wide range of clients across various sectors. This article provides an overview of the company's history, notable construction projects, and controversies surrounding its operations.\n\n# History\n\n## Main contractor\n\nShepherd Building Group was founded in 1890 by Thomas Shepherd, a skilled craftsman and entrepreneur. Initially, the company focused on providing traditional building services, including construction, repair, and maintenance. Over the years, the company expanded its services to include mechanical and electrical engineering, as well as facilities management. Today, Shepherd Building Group is a leading main contractor in the UK, with a strong reputation for delivering high-quality projects on time and within budget.\n\n## Manufactured products\n\nIn addition to its construction services, Shepherd Building Group also manufactures a range of building products, including steel frames, roof trusses, and timber engineering products. The company's manufacturing facilities are located throughout the UK, and its products are used in a wide range of construction projects, from residential developments to commercial and industrial buildings.\n\n## Disposal of non-core businesses\n\nIn recent years, Shepherd Building Group has disposed of several non-core businesses in order to focus on its core construction and manufacturing operations. For example, the company sold its interior fit-out business, Shepherd Interiors, in 2015. This move allowed the company to concentrate on its core strengths and improve its overall efficiency and competitiveness.\n\n# Notable construction projects\n\nShepherd Building Group has been involved in a wide range of notable construction projects over the years, including:\n\n* The redevelopment of the Liverpool FC stadium, Anfield\n* The construction of the Trinity Walk shopping center in Wakefield\n* The refurbishment of the historic Royal Opera House in London\n* The development of the award-winning residential scheme, One Blackfriars in London\n\nThese projects demonstrate the company's ability to deliver high-quality construction services to a wide range of clients across various sectors.\n\n# Controversies\n\nDespite its long history and reputation for quality, Shepherd Building Group has been involved in several controversies over the years.\n\n## Identity behind anonymous emails\n\nIn 2013, it was reported that Shepherd Building Group had been involved in a scandal surrounding anonymous emails sent to rival companies. The emails, which were sent from a fake email account, made false claims about the rival companies and attempted to discredit them. An investigation by the UK's Information Commissioner's Office found that the emails were sent by a Shepherd Building Group employee, who was subsequently disciplined.\n\n## Hand tool vibration\n\nIn 2015, Shepherd Building Group was fined £100,000 after a court found that the company had failed to protect its employees from the risks associated with hand tool vibration. The court heard that several employees had developed hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS) as a result of using vibrating hand tools without proper protection. The company was also ordered to pay £50,000 in costs.\n\n## Domain name disputes\n\nShepherd Building Group has been involved in several domain name disputes over the years, including a high-profile dispute with a rival company in 2012. The dispute centered on the registration of a domain name that was similar to the rival company's trademark. The case was eventually settled out of court.\n\n## Employment blacklisting\n\nIn 2013, it was reported that Shepherd Building Group had been involved in the construction industry's employment blacklisting scandal. The scandal, which was uncovered by the UK's Information Commissioner's Office, found that several major construction companies, including Shepherd Building Group, had been using a secret blacklist to vet potential employees. The blacklist, which was maintained by a company called The Consulting Association, contained the names of thousands of construction workers who had been deemed to be \"troublemakers\" or \"militants\".\n\n## Trinity Walk\n\nIn 2011, Shepherd Building Group was involved in a controversy surrounding the construction of the Trinity Walk shopping center in Wakefield. Local residents and traders complained that the company had failed to keep them informed about the project's progress, and that the construction work was causing significant disruption to the local area. The company eventually apologized for its handling of the project and agreed to improve its communication with local stakeholders.\n\n# See also\n\n* Construction industry\n* Building services\n* Facilities management\n* Steel frame construction\n* Timber engineering\n* Employment blacklisting\n* Hand-arm vibration syndrome", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Shepherd_Building_Group\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Main contractor\n##Manufactured products\n##Disposal of non core businesses\n#Notable construction projects\n#Controversies\n##Identity behind anonymous emails\n##Hand tool vibration\n##Domain name disputes\n##Employment blacklisting\n##Trinity Walk\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

During this period, France was under German occupation, and the black market thrived as a result of economic instability, rationing, and price controls. This article explores the background, development, and impact of the black market in wartime France, as well as its legacy in French history and culture.\n\n# Background\n\n## 1930s: inflation, instability and unrest\n\nThe 1930s were marked by economic instability and unrest in France. The country was struggling to recover from the devastating effects of World War I, and the global economic crisis of the 1930s had a significant impact on the French economy. Unemployment was high, and inflation was rampant, leading to widespread discontent and social unrest.\n\n## Fall of France\n\nIn May 1940, Germany launched a surprise attack on France, and the country quickly fell to the occupation forces. The French government, led by Marshal Philippe Pétain, signed an armistice with Germany on June 22, 1940, marking the beginning of a four-year occupation.\n\n# 1940-1941\n\n## Origins\n\nThe black market in wartime France emerged as a response to the economic instability and shortages caused by the occupation. The German authorities imposed strict controls on the French economy, including rationing and price controls, which led to widespread shortages and inflation.\n\n### Rationing and price controls\n\nThe German authorities introduced a system of rationing, which limited the amount of food, fuel, and other essential goods that people could purchase. At the same time, they imposed strict price controls, which made it difficult for producers to sell their goods at a profit.\n\n### Diversion from official channels\n\nAs a result of the shortages and price controls, many people began to divert goods from official channels to the black market. This included farmers who sold their produce directly to consumers, rather than through the official market, and industrialists who produced goods for the black market.\n\n### Clandestine networks\n\nThe black market relied on clandestine networks of traders, smugglers, and middlemen who operated outside the official economy. These networks were often organized by gangs and mafia-like groups, who used intimidation and violence to maintain their control over the market.\n\n### Hidden stockpiling\n\nMany people, particularly the wealthy and privileged, began to stockpile goods in secret warehouses and hidden caches. This allowed them to accumulate wealth and power, while also avoiding the strict controls imposed by the German authorities.\n\n### Grey market\n\nThe grey market, also known as the \"marché gris,\" referred to the semi-licit trade in goods that were not strictly prohibited by the authorities, but were not officially approved either. This included goods such as tobacco, coffee, and chocolate, which were in short supply and highly prized.\n\n## Users of the black market\n\n### Privileged French\n\nThe black market was used by many privileged French people, including the wealthy, the clergy, and high-ranking officials. These individuals were able to use their power and influence to accumulate wealth and goods, while also avoiding the strict controls imposed by the German authorities.\n\n### Occupation forces\n\nThe German occupation forces also used the black market to acquire goods and supplies. Many German soldiers and officials became involved in the black market, either directly or indirectly, and used their power to exploit the French population.\n\n## Public response\n\n### Early condemnation\n\nThe black market was initially condemned by many people, who saw it as a threat to the official economy and the war effort. However, as the occupation continued and shortages worsened, many people began to see the black market as a necessary evil.\n\n### Participation\n\nAs the black market grew, many people began to participate in it, either directly or indirectly. This included housewives who bought goods on the black market to feed their families, and workers who sold goods on the black market to supplement their incomes.\n\n### Housewives' demonstrations\n\nIn 1941, a series of housewives' demonstrations took place in several French cities, protesting the shortages and high prices of food and other essential goods. These demonstrations were seen as a turning point in public opinion, as they highlighted the desperation and frustration of many ordinary people.\n\n### Suspicions of hoarding\n\nAs the black market grew, many people began to suspect that hoarding was widespread, particularly among the wealthy and privileged. This led to increased resentment and anger towards those who were seen as profiting from the shortages and suffering of others.\n\n### Official antisemitism\n\nThe Vichy government, which collaborated with the German occupation authorities, began to promote official antisemitism, blaming Jews for the economic problems and shortages. This led to increased persecution and violence against Jews, who were already vulnerable and marginalized.\n\n### Public opinion\n\nAs the occupation continued, public opinion became increasingly divided. Many people saw the black market as a necessary evil, while others condemned it as a threat to the official economy and the war effort.\n\n### Political opposition\n\nThe black market also became a focal point for political opposition to the Vichy government and the German occupation. Many resistance groups and opposition politicians saw the black market as a symbol of the regime's failure and corruption.\n\n## Response by authorities\n\nThe German authorities and the Vichy government responded to the black market with a mix of repression and tolerance. On the one hand, they imposed strict controls and punishments on those caught participating in the black market. On the other hand, they also tolerated the black market to some extent, recognizing that it was a necessary evil in a time of war and shortages.\n\n# Widespread black market (autumn 1941 to 1943)\n\n## Agricultural black market\n\nThe agricultural black market thrived during this period, as farmers sold their produce directly to consumers, rather than through the official market. This led to widespread shortages and inflation, as well as increased resentment towards the government and the occupation authorities.\n\n## Grey market: direct sales\n\nThe grey market also thrived during this period, as people began to sell goods directly to each other, rather than through official channels. This included goods such as tobacco, coffee, and chocolate, which were in short supply and highly prized.\n\n## Commerce and industry\n\nThe black market also affected commerce and industry, as many businesses began to produce goods for the black market, rather than for the official economy. This led to increased corruption and inefficiency, as well as increased resentment towards the government and the occupation authorities.\n\n## Tacit tolerance\n\nThe authorities began to tolerate the black market to some extent, recognizing that it was a necessary evil in a time of war and shortages. This led to a degree of stability and predictability, as people began to adapt to the new reality of the black market.\n\n### No longer immoral\n\nThe black market was no longer seen as immoral or unpatriotic, but rather as a necessary evil in a time of war and shortages. This led to increased participation and acceptance, as people began to see the black market as a way to survive and thrive in difficult circumstances.\n\n### Nuanced and refocused enforcement\n\nThe authorities began to enforce the rules in a more nuanced and refocused way, targeting those who were seen as profiting from the shortages and suffering of others, rather than those who were simply trying to survive.\n\n## Metrics\n\n### Proportion of production\n\nEstimates suggest that up to 50% of agricultural production was diverted to the black market during this period, leading to widespread shortages and inflation.\n\n### Higher and more volatile prices\n\nPrices on the black market were significantly higher and more volatile than those on the official market, leading to increased resentment and anger towards those who were seen as profiting from the shortages and suffering of others.\n\n### Geographic distribution\n\nThe black market was more prevalent in urban areas, where shortages and inflation were more acute. However, it also existed in rural areas, where farmers sold their produce directly to consumers, rather than through the official market.\n\n### Beneficiaries\n\nThe beneficiaries of the black market included those who were able to accumulate wealth and power, such as the wealthy and privileged, as well as those who were able to survive and thrive in difficult circumstances, such as housewives and workers.\n\n# Patriotism (spring 1943-summer 1944)\n\n## Enforcement for the occupiers\n\nThe German authorities began to enforce the rules more strictly, targeting those who were seen as profiting from the shortages and suffering of others, rather than those who were simply trying to survive. This led to increased resentment and anger towards the occupation authorities.\n\n### Economic pillage and the end of the German black market\n\nThe German authorities began to pillage the French economy, taking goods and resources for their own use. This led to the end of the German black market, as well as increased resentment and anger towards the occupation authorities.\n\n### Countermeasures and collaboration\n\nThe Vichy government and the German occupation authorities began to take countermeasures against the black market, including increased repression and propaganda. This led to increased collaboration between the authorities and the black market, as people began to see the black market as a way to resist the occupation.\n\n### Milice vs the black market\n\nThe Milice, a French paramilitary organization that collaborated with the German occupation authorities, began to target the black market, seeing it as a threat to their power and authority. This led to increased violence and repression, as well as increased resentment and anger towards the Milice and the occupation authorities.\n\n## Fraud and Resistance\n\n### Resistance encouragement\n\nThe black market became a focal point for resistance to the occupation, as people began to see it as a way to resist the authorities and survive in difficult circumstances. This led to increased encouragement and support for the resistance, as well as increased participation in the black market.\n\n### Blaming the Resistance\n\nThe authorities began to blame the resistance for the black market, seeing it as a way to discredit and undermine the resistance. This led to increased repression and violence, as well as increased resentment and anger towards the authorities.\n\n### End of the occupation\n\nThe occupation came to an end in August 1944, as Allied forces liberated France. The black market continued to exist, but it was no longer seen as a necessary evil, but rather as a relic of the occupation.\n\n# After the Liberation (1944-1949)\n\n## Épuration and illicit profits\n\n### Pursuit and punishment\n\nThe authorities began to pursue and punish those who had profited from the black market during the occupation, seeing it as a way to restore justice and morality. This led to increased repression and violence, as well as increased resentment and anger towards the authorities.\n\n### Confiscation of illicit profits\n\nThe authorities began to confiscate the illicit profits of the black market, seeing it as a way to restore justice and morality. This led to increased resentment and anger towards the authorities, as well as increased participation in the black market.\n\n## Continued black market operations\n\n### Continued trafficking\n\nThe black market continued to exist, as people continued to traffic in goods and services. This led to increased resentment and anger towards the authorities, as well as increased participation in the black market.\n\n### Generalized fraud\n\nThe black market became more generalized and widespread, as people began to see it as a way to survive and thrive in difficult circumstances. This led to increased resentment and anger towards the authorities, as well as increased participation in the black market.\n\n### Government powerlessness\n\nThe government was powerless to stop the black market, as people continued to participate in it. This led to increased resentment and anger towards the government, as well as increased participation in the black market.\n\n### Towards the free market\n\nThe black market began to evolve towards a free market, as people began to see it as a way to survive and thrive in difficult circumstances. This led to increased participation and acceptance, as well as increased resentment and anger towards the authorities.\n\n# Historical memory\n\n## Historiography\n\nThe historiography of the black market in wartime France is complex and multifaceted, reflecting the different perspectives and experiences of those who lived through it. This led to increased debate and discussion, as well as increased understanding and nuance.\n\n## Collective unconscious and cultural roots\n\n### Early recollections\n\nThe collective unconscious and cultural roots of the black market in wartime France are still remembered and commemorated today, reflecting the deep impact it had on French society and culture.
