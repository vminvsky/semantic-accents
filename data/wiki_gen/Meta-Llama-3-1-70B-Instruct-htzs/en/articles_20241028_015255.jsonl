The war is primarily fought between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), with other armed groups also involved. The conflict has resulted in significant humanitarian, economic, and political consequences for Sudan.\n\n# Background\n\n## War in Darfur and the formation of the RSF\n\nThe war in Darfur, which began in 2003, led to the formation of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in 2013. The RSF was initially a militia group formed by the Sudanese government to fight against rebel groups in Darfur. The RSF was led by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as Hemedti, who would later become a key figure in the 2023 conflict.\n\n## Political transition\n\nIn 2019, Sudan experienced a political transition following the ousting of President Omar al-Bashir. The transition led to the establishment of a transitional government, which included both military and civilian representatives. However, the transition was marked by tensions between the military and civilian components of the government.\n\n## Origins of the SPLM-N and the SLM\n\nThe Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N) and the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM) are two rebel groups that have been involved in the conflict. The SPLM-N was formed in 2011, and the SLM was formed in 2002. Both groups have been fighting against the Sudanese government for greater autonomy and representation.\n\n## Prelude\n\nIn the months leading up to the conflict, tensions between the SAF and the RSF increased. The RSF had become increasingly powerful and influential, and the SAF saw them as a threat to their authority. In February 2023, the RSF began to deploy troops to the capital city of Khartoum, which led to a significant increase in tensions.\n\n# Course of the war\n\n## April–May 2023\n\n### Battle of Khartoum\n\nOn April 15, 2023, fighting broke out in Khartoum between the SAF and the RSF.

The RSF was able to gain control of several key locations in the city, including the airport and the presidential palace.\n\n### Treaty of Jeddah\n\nOn May 11, 2023, the SAF and the RSF signed the Treaty of Jeddah, which was brokered by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The treaty called for a ceasefire and the establishment of a joint committee to oversee the disarmament of the RSF.\n\n## June–September 2023\n\n### Continued fighting in Khartoum\n\nDespite the Treaty of Jeddah, fighting continued in Khartoum. The RSF was able to maintain control of several key locations, and the SAF was unable to dislodge them.\n\n### Diplomatic efforts\n\nIn June 2023, the African Union and the United Nations began to increase their diplomatic efforts to end the conflict. However, their efforts were unsuccessful, and the fighting continued.\n\n### SPLM-N (Al-Hilu) involvement\n\nIn July 2023, the SPLM-N (Al-Hilu) faction, led by Abdelaziz al-Hilu, announced that it would join the conflict on the side of the RSF. The SPLM-N (Al-Hilu) is a rebel group that has been fighting against the Sudanese government for greater autonomy and representation.\n\n### Darfur front\n\nIn August 2023, fighting broke out in Darfur between the SAF and the RSF.

The RSF was unwilling to accept a power-sharing agreement, and the SAF was unwilling to accept the RSF's demands for greater autonomy.\n\n### RSF Crossing of the Nile\n\nIn December 2023, the RSF crossed the Nile River and began to advance on the city of Omdurman. The SAF was unable to stop them, and the RSF was able to gain control of the city.\n\n## January–April 2024\n\n### Hemedti travels abroad\n\nIn January 2024, Hemedti traveled abroad to meet with foreign leaders.

The RSF was able to gain control of several key locations, including the city of El Obeid.\n\n### SAF gains in Omdurman\n\nIn March 2024, the SAF was able to gain control of several key locations in Omdurman. However, the RSF was still able to maintain control of the city.\n\n## April 2024–present\n\n### Fighting in Darfur\n\nFighting continues in Darfur between the SAF and the RSF.

I. Suchianu\n\nDimitrie Ioan Suchianu, commonly known as D. I. Suchianu, was a Romanian literary critic, journalist, and politician. Born on November 8, 1896, in the town of Fălticeni, Romania, Suchianu went on to become one of the most prominent cultural figures of his generation, playing a significant role in shaping the country's literary landscape.\n\n# Biography\n\n## Early life and debut\n\nSuchianu's early life was marked by a passion for literature and a strong desire to pursue a career in writing. He began his education at the local high school in Fălticeni, where he developed a keen interest in Romanian literature and culture. After completing his secondary education, Suchianu moved to the city of Iași, where he enrolled in the University of Iași's Faculty of Letters.\n\nDuring his time at university, Suchianu became involved in various literary circles and began to establish himself as a rising talent in Romanian literary criticism. His early work was characterized by a strong emphasis on the importance of national identity and the need for Romanian literature to assert its unique voice and perspective.\n\n## Interwar culture critic\n\nFollowing his graduation from university, Suchianu began to establish himself as a prominent cultural critic and journalist. He wrote for various publications, including the influential literary magazine \"Viața Românească\", where he became known for his incisive and thought-provoking reviews of contemporary Romanian literature.\n\nSuchianu's criticism was marked by a strong sense of nationalism and a commitment to promoting the interests of Romanian writers and artists. He was a vocal advocate for the development of a distinctively Romanian literary style, one that would reflect the country's unique cultural heritage and traditions.\n\n## Under fascism\n\nIn the late 1930s, Romania began to slide towards fascism, with the rise of the Iron Guard and other far-right movements. Suchianu, like many of his contemporaries, found himself caught up in the increasingly polarized and repressive atmosphere of the time.\n\nDespite his initial reservations about the fascist movement, Suchianu ultimately became a supporter of the regime, seeing it as a necessary bulwark against the spread of communism and the perceived threat of Jewish and other minority groups. His writing from this period reflects a growing emphasis on the importance of national unity and the need for Romanians to rally behind a strong and authoritarian leader.\n\n## 1944 coup and communization\n\nIn August 1944, a coup led by King Michael I overthrew the fascist regime and brought an end to Romania's alliance with Nazi Germany. Suchianu, who had by this time become a prominent figure in the fascist movement, found himself in a precarious position.\n\nAs the communist party began to consolidate its power in the aftermath of the coup, Suchianu attempted to distance himself from his earlier fascist sympathies and position himself as a supporter of the new regime. However, his efforts were ultimately unsuccessful, and he found himself increasingly marginalized and excluded from public life.\n\n## Old age and death\n\nIn his later years, Suchianu lived a quiet and reclusive life, largely removed from the public eye. He continued to write, but his work from this period is marked by a sense of disillusionment and disappointment.\n\nSuchianu died on September 23, 1985, at the age of 88, in the town of Fălticeni, where he had been born. His legacy as a literary critic and journalist is complex and contested, reflecting the tumultuous and often divisive nature of Romanian politics and culture during his lifetime.\n\n# Legacy\n\nD. I. Suchianu's legacy is a complex and multifaceted one, reflecting the various phases and contradictions of his long and varied career. As a literary critic and journalist, he played a significant role in shaping the course of Romanian literature and culture, advocating for the development of a distinctively Romanian literary style and promoting the interests of Romanian writers and artists.\n\nHowever, his support for the fascist regime and his attempts to distance himself from his earlier sympathies have left a lasting stain on his reputation, and his legacy remains a subject of debate and controversy.\n\n# Notes\n\nThe life and work of D. I. Suchianu offer a fascinating and complex case study of the intersections and contradictions between politics, culture, and identity. As a literary critic and journalist, he played a significant role in shaping the course of Romanian literature and culture, but his legacy is ultimately marked by a sense of disappointment and disillusionment.\n\n# References", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"D._I._Suchianu\" following this outline:\n\n#Biography\n##Early life and debut\n##Interwar culture critic\n##Under fascism\n##1944 coup and communization\n##Old age and death\n#Legacy\n#Notes\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Some notable teams that received compensatory picks include:\n\n* The New England Patriots, who received four compensatory picks\n* The Dallas Cowboys, who received three compensatory picks\n* The Green Bay Packers, who received two compensatory picks\n\nThese compensatory picks gave teams additional opportunities to select players in the draft, and helped to offset the losses they had suffered in free agency.\n\n# Supplemental draft\n\nThe NFL supplemental draft took place on July 11, 2023, with a total of six players eligible for selection.

The incident involved two vintage World War II aircraft, a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress and a Bell P-63 Kingcobra, which collided in mid-air and crashed to the ground, resulting in the loss of six lives.\n\n# Aircraft\n\nThe two aircraft involved in the collision were a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, a four-engine heavy bomber, and a Bell P-63 Kingcobra, a single-engine fighter aircraft. The B-17, also known as the \"Texas Raiders,\" was a restored aircraft that had been built in 1945 and was operated by the Commemorative Air Force (CAF), a non-profit organization dedicated to preserving and flying vintage military aircraft. The P-63, also operated by the CAF, was a restored aircraft that had been built in 1944.\n\nBoth aircraft were participating in the Wings Over Dallas air show, which was being held to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the D-Day invasion of Normandy during World War II. The air show featured a number of vintage military aircraft, including the B-17 and P-63, which were performing a mock dogfighting routine when the collision occurred.\n\n## Aircraft Specifications\n\nThe Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress is a four-engine heavy bomber aircraft that was widely used by the United States military during World War II. The aircraft has a wingspan of 103 feet 9 inches (31.6 meters) and is powered by four Wright R-1820 radial engines, each producing 1,200 horsepower. The B-17 has a maximum speed of 287 miles per hour (462 kilometers per hour) and a range of 3,000 miles (4,800 kilometers).\n\nThe Bell P-63 Kingcobra is a single-engine fighter aircraft that was also used by the United States military during World War II. The aircraft has a wingspan of 38 feet 4 inches (11.7 meters) and is powered by a Pratt & Whitney R-2800 radial engine, producing 1,800 horsepower. The P-63 has a maximum speed of 410 miles per hour (660 kilometers per hour) and a range of 450 miles (720 kilometers).\n\n# Crash\n\nThe mid-air collision occurred at approximately 1:20 pm local time on November 12, 2022, during the Wings Over Dallas air show. The B-17 and P-63 were performing a mock dogfighting routine when they collided in mid-air, resulting in a massive explosion and fireball. Both aircraft crashed to the ground, with the B-17 coming to rest in a nearby parking lot and the P-63 crashing into a nearby field.\n\nWitnesses described the collision as a \" massive explosion\" that shook the ground and sent debris flying in all directions. \"It was like a bomb went off,\" one witness said. \"I was standing about 100 feet away from the crash site, and it felt like the ground shook beneath my feet.\"\n\n## Crash Site\n\nThe crash site was located near the Dallas Executive Airport, which is a small general aviation airport located in the southern part of Dallas. The airport is used by a number of private aircraft and flight schools, and is also home to the Commemorative Air Force, which operates a number of vintage military aircraft.\n\nThe crash site was secured by local authorities, who worked to recover the remains of the six people killed in the crash. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) also sent a team to the crash site to investigate the cause of the collision.\n\n# Victims\n\nSix people were killed in the mid-air collision, including the pilots of both aircraft. The victims were identified as:\n\n* Terry Barker, 67, a pilot and member of the Commemorative Air Force\n* Craig Hutain, 72, a pilot and member of the Commemorative Air Force\n* Dan Ragan, 63, a crew member on the B-17\n* Kevin \"K5\" Michels, 58, a crew member on the B-17\n* Leonard \"Len\" Root, 66, a crew member on the B-17\n* Curt Rowe, 64, a crew member on the P-63\n\nAll of the victims were experienced pilots and crew members who had been involved with the Commemorative Air Force for many years. They were remembered by their colleagues and friends as dedicated and passionate individuals who loved flying and preserving the history of military aviation.\n\n## Tributes\n\nTributes poured in for the victims of the crash, with many people expressing their condolences on social media and at the crash site. The Commemorative Air Force also released a statement expressing its sadness and shock at the loss of its members.\n\n\"We are deeply saddened by the loss of our friends and fellow aviators,\" the statement said. \"Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of those who were killed in the crash.\"\n\n# Investigation\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) launched an investigation into the cause of the mid-air collision. The investigation was led by a team of NTSB investigators, who worked to gather evidence and interview witnesses.\n\nThe investigation focused on a number of factors, including the pilots' experience and training, the maintenance history of the aircraft, and the air show's safety procedures. The NTSB also reviewed video footage of the crash, which showed the two aircraft colliding in mid-air.\n\n## Investigation Findings\n\nThe NTSB's investigation found that the probable cause of the collision was the failure of the pilots to maintain adequate separation from each other during the mock dogfighting routine. The investigation also found that the air show's safety procedures were inadequate, and that the pilots had not received sufficient training on the risks of mid-air collisions.\n\nThe NTSB made a number of recommendations to improve safety at air shows, including the implementation of more stringent safety procedures and the provision of additional training for pilots.\n\n# Public Response\n\nThe mid-air collision sparked a widespread public response, with many people expressing their shock and sadness at the loss of life. The incident also raised concerns about the safety of air shows, with some people calling for stricter safety regulations.\n\nThe incident also sparked a debate about the risks and benefits of air shows, with some people arguing that they are an important way to preserve the history of military aviation, while others argued that they are too dangerous and should be banned.\n\n## Air Show Safety\n\nThe incident highlighted the risks of air shows, which involve high-performance aircraft flying at low altitudes and performing complex maneuvers. While air shows can be thrilling to watch, they also pose a significant risk to pilots, crew members, and spectators.\n\nIn response to the incident, some air show organizers announced that they would be implementing new safety measures, including the use of more-stringent safety procedures and the provision of additional training for pilots.\n\n# References\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)\n\n# External Links\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Dallas_air_show_mid-air_collision\" following this outline:\n\n#Aircraft\n#Crash\n#Victims\n#Investigation\n#Public response\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Chase, a prominent figure in American politics and law, had served on the Supreme Court since 1796. His impeachment trial, which took place in 1805, was a major test of the Constitution's impeachment provisions and had far-reaching implications for the relationship between the judiciary and the other branches of government.\n\n#Background\n\nSamuel Chase was a prominent figure in American politics and law, having served as a delegate to the Continental Congress, a member of the Maryland State Legislature, and as a Justice of the United States Supreme Court. He was known for his strong Federalist views and his advocacy for a strong central government. Chase's judicial philosophy was shaped by his Federalist ideology, and he was often at odds with the Democratic-Republican Party, which dominated the government during the early 19th century.\n\nIn 1804, Chase presided over the treason trial of John Fries, a Pennsylvania farmer who had led a rebellion against the federal government. Chase's handling of the trial was widely criticized, with many arguing that he had acted in a biased and partisan manner. The trial's outcome was also seen as a miscarriage of justice, with Fries being sentenced to death despite questionable evidence. The Fries trial marked a turning point in Chase's career, as it drew widespread criticism and calls for his impeachment.\n\n#Impeachment in the House of Representatives\n\n##Vote to launch impeachment inquiry\n\nOn March 12, 1805, the House of Representatives voted to launch an impeachment inquiry into Chase's conduct. The vote was largely along party lines, with 73 Democratic-Republicans voting in favor of the inquiry and 32 Federalists opposing it.\n\n##Early inquiry developments\n\nThe impeachment inquiry was led by a special committee, which gathered evidence and testimony from witnesses. The committee's investigation focused on Chase's conduct during the Fries trial, as well as other allegations of judicial misconduct.\n\n##Adoption of impeachment resolution\n\nOn October 31, 1804, the House of Representatives adopted a resolution impeaching Chase on several counts. The resolution accused Chase of \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" and alleged that he had acted in a biased and partisan manner during the Fries trial.\n\n##Subsequent months of inquiry\n\nOver the next several months, the House of Representatives continued to gather evidence and testimony. The inquiry was marked by partisan rancor, with Federalists accusing the Democratic-Republicans of pursuing a vendetta against Chase.\n\n##Adoption of articles of impeachment\n\nOn March 2, 1805, the House of Representatives adopted eight articles of impeachment against Chase. The articles accused Chase of:\n\n###Article I\n\n* Acting in a biased and partisan manner during the Fries trial\n* Denying Fries a fair trial by limiting the introduction of evidence\n* Acting in a manner that was \"highly arbitrary, oppressive, and unjust\"\n\n###Article II\n\n* Making \"highly inflammatory and unbecoming\" remarks during the Fries trial\n* Acting in a manner that was \"calculated to excite the passions of the jury\"\n\n###Article III\n\n* Allowing the prosecution to present \"ex parte\" evidence during the Fries trial\n* Failing to provide Fries with adequate notice of the charges against him\n\n###Article IV\n\n* Acting in a biased and partisan manner during the trial of James Thompson Callender\n* Denying Callender a fair trial by limiting the introduction of evidence\n\n###Article V\n\n* Making \"highly inflammatory and unbecoming\" remarks during the Callender trial\n* Acting in a manner that was \"calculated to excite the passions of the jury\"\n\n###Article VI\n\n* Allowing the prosecution to present \"ex parte\" evidence during the Callender trial\n* Failing to provide Callender with adequate notice of the charges against him\n\n###Article VII\n\n* Acting in a biased and partisan manner during the trial of James Wilkinson\n* Denying Wilkinson a fair trial by limiting the introduction of evidence\n\n###Article VIII\n\n* Failing to provide Wilkinson with adequate notice of the charges against him\n* Acting in a manner that was \"highly arbitrary, oppressive, and unjust\"\n\n###Vote overview\n\nThe vote on the articles of impeachment was largely along party lines, with 72 Democratic-Republicans voting in favor of the articles and 32 Federalists opposing them.\n\n#Appointment of House managers\n\nFollowing the adoption of the articles of impeachment, the House of Representatives appointed a team of managers to prosecute the case against Chase in the Senate. The team was led by John Randolph of Virginia and included several other prominent Democratic-Republicans.\n\n#Senate trial\n\n##Officers of the trial\n\nThe Senate trial was presided over by Vice President George Clinton, who served as the President of the Senate. The Secretary of the Senate, Samuel Otis, served as the chief clerk of the trial.\n\n##Rules of the trial\n\nThe Senate adopted a set of rules to govern the trial, which included provisions for the presentation of evidence, the examination of witnesses, and the submission of arguments.\n\n##Start of the proceedings\n\nThe trial began on February 4, 1805, with the reading of the articles of impeachment. The prosecution presented its case over the next several weeks, calling numerous witnesses and presenting a large volume of evidence.\n\n##Decoration and arrangement of the Senate Chamber\n\nThe Senate Chamber was specially decorated for the trial, with the addition of a raised platform for the judges and a special enclosure for the defendant.\n\n##Pleading phase\n\nFollowing the presentation of the evidence, Chase entered a plea of not guilty to the articles of impeachment. The prosecution then responded with a formal replication to the plea.\n\n##Argument phase\n\nThe argument phase of the trial began on March 2, 1805, with the prosecution presenting its case against Chase. The prosecution argued that Chase had acted in a biased and partisan manner during the Fries trial and had denied Fries a fair trial.\n\n###Prosecution's presentation\n\nThe prosecution's presentation was led by John Randolph, who delivered a series of impassioned speeches against Chase. Randolph argued that Chase had acted in a manner that was \"highly arbitrary, oppressive, and unjust\" and that he had denied Fries a fair trial.\n\n###Defense's presentation\n\nThe defense's presentation was led by Robert Goodloe Harper, who argued that Chase had acted in good faith during the Fries trial and had not denied Fries a fair trial. Harper also argued that the impeachment was motivated by partisan politics and that the Democratic-Republicans were seeking to punish Chase for his Federalist views.\n\n###Closing remarks\n\nThe argument phase of the trial concluded on March 6, 1805, with closing remarks from both sides. The prosecution argued that Chase was guilty of the charges and that he should be removed from office. The defense argued that Chase was not guilty and that the impeachment was a partisan vendetta.\n\n##Verdict\n\nThe Senate voted on the articles of impeachment on March 1, 1805. Chase was acquitted on all eight articles, with the Senate voting 19-15 on the first article and 18-16 on the remaining articles.\n\n#Aftermath\n\n##Immediate aftermath\n\nFollowing the acquittal, Chase returned to his duties on the Supreme Court. The impeachment trial had significant implications for the relationship between the judiciary and the other branches of government, as it established the principle that judges could not be impeached for their judicial decisions.\n\n##Legacy\n\nThe impeachment trial of Samuel Chase is still studied by scholars today, and it remains an important part of American history. The trial marked a significant turning point in the development of the Constitution's impeachment provisions and established important precedents for future impeachment trials.\n\n#References\n\n##Sources cited\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as the article does not include citations or references.)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Impeachment_of_Samuel_Chase\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Impeachment in the House of Representatives\n##Vote to launch impeachment inquiry\n##Early inquiry developments\n##Adoption of impeachment resolution\n##Subsequent months of inquiry\n##Adoption of articles of impeachment\n###Article I\n###Article II\n###Article III\n###Article IV\n###Article V\n###Article VI\n###Article VII\n###Article VIII\n###Vote overview\n#Appointment of House managers\n#Senate trial\n##Officers of the trial\n##Rules of the trial\n##Start of the proceedings\n##Decoration and arrangement of the Senate Chamber\n##Pleading phase\n##Argument phase\n###Prosecution's presentation\n###Defense's presentation\n###Closing remarks\n##Verdict\n#Aftermath\n##Immediate aftermath\n##Legacy\n#References\n##Sources cited\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Since its completion in 1941, the monument has been featured in countless forms of media, from films and television shows to music and advertisements. This article explores the reasons behind Mount Rushmore's enduring popularity in popular culture, common themes and motifs associated with the monument, and notable examples of its portrayal in various media.\n\n# Reasons for Popularity\n\nMount Rushmore's popularity in popular culture can be attributed to a combination of factors. One reason is its unique and awe-inspiring design, which features four gigantic faces of notable American presidents: George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln. The sheer scale and majesty of the sculpture make it a compelling subject for artistic and cultural expression.\n\nAnother reason for Mount Rushmore's popularity is its association with American history and identity. The monument is often seen as a symbol of American values and ideals, such as democracy, freedom, and patriotism. This symbolism is often exploited in popular culture, where Mount Rushmore is used to represent America and its values.\n\nAdditionally, Mount Rushmore's remote location in the Black Hills of South Dakota adds to its mystique and allure. The monument's isolation and natural surroundings make it a dramatic and picturesque subject, often used in film and television to represent the American wilderness.\n\n# Common Themes\n\nMount Rushmore's portrayal in popular culture often involves certain themes and motifs, which reflect its symbolism and cultural significance.\n\n## Destruction\n\nOne common theme associated with Mount Rushmore is destruction. This motif is often used in disaster movies and action films, where the monument is depicted as being destroyed or threatened by various catastrophes, such as earthquakes, nuclear attacks, or alien invasions. This theme serves to highlight the monument's vulnerability and the importance of preserving American culture and history.\n\n## Alterations and Additions to the Faces\n\nAnother common theme is the alteration or addition of faces to the monument. This motif is often used in comedy films and satire, where new faces are added or existing ones are modified to comment on contemporary issues or politics. This theme serves to poke fun at the monument's symbolism and the American values it represents.\n\n# Imitations of the Style\n\nMount Rushmore's unique style has been imitated and parodied in various forms of media, from advertisements to theme park attractions. These imitations often involve the creation of miniature or mock versions of the monument, featuring different faces or characters. This trend reflects the monument's cultural significance and its enduring appeal as a symbol of American identity.\n\n# Major Portrayals\n\nMount Rushmore has been featured in numerous films and television shows over the years, often serving as a backdrop or plot device. One notable example is the 1959 film North by Northwest, directed by Alfred Hitchcock.\n\n## In North by Northwest\n\nIn North by Northwest, Mount Rushmore is featured prominently in the film's climax, where the protagonist, Roger Thornhill, played by Cary Grant, is chased by villains through the monument's grounds. The film's use of Mount Rushmore serves to highlight the monument's drama and majesty, while also exploiting its symbolism as a symbol of American identity.\n\n# In Music\n\nMount Rushmore has also been referenced in music, often serving as a metaphor for American values and culture. One notable example is the song \"Mount Rushmore,\" by the band Electric Light Orchestra (ELO), which features lyrics that comment on the monument's symbolism and cultural significance.\n\n# See Also\n\n* Mount Rushmore\n* Black Hills\n* American culture\n* Popular culture\n* Monumental architecture\n* Sculpture\n* Film\n* Television\n* Music", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Mount_Rushmore_in_popular_culture\" following this outline:\n\n#Reasons for popularity\n#Common themes\n##Destruction\n##Alterations and additions to the faces\n#Imitations of the style\n#Major portrayals\n##In North by Northwest\n#In music\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Situated along the Ottawa River, the village has a rich history dating back to the early 19th century. From its humble beginnings as a mill town to its current status as a desirable residential area, Britannia Village has undergone significant transformations over the years. This article explores the history, heritage, character, and notable residents of Britannia Village.\n\n# History\n\n## Mill town (1826–1887)\n\nBritannia Village was founded in 1826 by the Britannia Lumber Company, which built a sawmill on the Ottawa River. The mill town quickly grew, attracting workers and their families from across the region. The village became a thriving community, with a general store, schools, and churches serving the needs of its residents. During this period, Britannia Village was a major producer of lumber, with the mill processing vast quantities of timber from the surrounding forests.\n\n## Summer-cottage resort (1887–1960)\n\nIn the late 19th century, Britannia Village began to transition from a mill town to a summer-cottage resort. As the lumber industry declined, wealthy Ottawa residents started to build summer homes in the village, attracted by its natural beauty and proximity to the city. This new era saw the construction of many charming cottages, often featuring large porches and ornate woodwork.\n\n### Engineering feats\n\nOne notable engineering feat from this period is the Britannia Bridge, which spans the Ottawa River and connects the village to the Ontario mainland. Constructed in the late 19th century, the bridge was a major engineering achievement, providing a vital transportation link between Britannia Village and the rest of Ottawa.\n\n### Britannia Amusement Park\n\nIn the early 20th century, Britannia Village was home to the Britannia Amusement Park, a popular destination for Ottawa residents and visitors alike. The park featured a range of attractions, including roller coasters, Ferris wheels, and dance halls. Although the park closed in the 1950s, its legacy lives on in the memories of those who visited it.\n\n## Rural commuter town (1960–2000)\n\nAs Ottawa expanded in the mid-20th century, Britannia Village became a rural commuter town, attracting families who worked in the city but wanted to live in a more rural setting. During this period, the village underwent significant development, with new homes and subdivisions being built to accommodate the growing population.\n\n## Revitalization (since 2000)\n\nIn recent years, Britannia Village has undergone a revitalization of sorts, with many of its historic buildings being restored and repurposed. This effort has helped to preserve the village's unique character and charm, making it an attractive destination for tourists and residents alike.\n\n### Flood proofing\n\nOne major challenge facing Britannia Village is the risk of flooding, particularly during the spring thaw. In response to this threat, the city of Ottawa has implemented various flood-proofing measures, including the construction of a new dike system and the elevation of homes in flood-prone areas.\n\n### Gentrification\n\nAs Britannia Village has become more desirable, it has also experienced gentrification, with many of its older homes being renovated and sold to new owners. While this trend has helped to revitalize the village, it has also raised concerns about affordability and the displacement of long-time residents.\n\n# Heritage buildings and architectural style\n\nBritannia Village is home to many heritage buildings, each with its own unique character and charm. These buildings reflect the village's history and architectural style, which is characterized by a mix of Victorian, Edwardian, and Arts and Crafts influences.\n\n## Addresses of buildings with heritage status\n\nSome notable heritage buildings in Britannia Village include:\n\n* 1 Britannia Road, a Victorian-era home built in the 1870s\n* 10 Britannia Road, an Arts and Crafts-style bungalow built in the 1910s\n* 20 Britannia Road, a Edwardian-era home built in the 1900s\n\n## Heritage attributes in modern residences\n\nMany modern homes in Britannia Village incorporate heritage attributes, such as large porches, woodwork, and ornate detailing. These features help to maintain the village's unique character and charm, while also providing a sense of continuity with its past.\n\n# Character\n\nBritannia Village has a distinct character that is shaped by its history, architecture, and natural setting. The village is known for its friendly and welcoming community, as well as its many parks and green spaces. Visitors to the village often comment on its relaxed and peaceful atmosphere, which is perfect for a summer stroll or a family picnic.\n\n# Notables in the community\n\nBritannia Village has been home to many notable residents over the years, including:\n\n* Sir Wilfrid Laurier, Canada's seventh prime minister, who summered in the village in the early 20th century\n* Sir John A. Macdonald, Canada's first prime minister, who owned a summer home in the village\n* Dr. James Naismith, the inventor of basketball, who lived in the village for many years\n\n# Notes\n\nBritannia Village is a unique and special place that offers a glimpse into Ottawa's rich history and cultural heritage. Its natural beauty, charming architecture, and friendly community make it a must-visit destination for anyone interested in exploring the city's west end.\n\n# References\n\nSources:\n\n* \"A History of Britannia Village\" by the Britannia Village Heritage Committee\n* \"Britannia Village: A Community History\" by the City of Ottawa\n* \"The Ottawa River Valley\" by the Ottawa River Valley Association", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Britannia_Village,_Ottawa\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Mill town (1826–1887)\n##Summer-cottage resort (1887–1960)\n###Engineering feats\n###Britannia Amusement Park\n##Rural commuter town (1960–2000)\n##Revitalization (since 2000)\n###Flood proofing\n###Gentrification\n#Heritage buildings and architectural style\n##Addresses of buildings with heritage status\n##Heritage attributes in modern residences\n#Character\n#Notables in the community\n#Notes\n#References\n##Sources\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It emerged during the Warring States period (475-221 BCE) and was influential in the development of Chinese thought and politics. This article provides an overview of the key concepts, figures, and influences of Legalism.\n\nRetrospective current\n-------------------\n\n### Chapter 43 Ding fa\n\nThe concept of \"Ding fa\" or \"Decreeing the Law\" is central to Legalist thought. It refers to the idea that the ruler must establish clear laws and regulations to govern society. This concept is discussed in Chapter 43 of the Han Feizi, a foundational text of Legalism.\n\n### Imperial Confucian category\n\nDuring the Han dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE), Confucianism became the state ideology, and Legalism was classified as a \"heretical\" school of thought. However, many Confucian scholars incorporated Legalist ideas into their own works, demonstrating the ongoing influence of Legalism on Chinese thought.\n\nMilitary mobilization\n-------------------\n\nLegalism was closely tied to the military mobilization of the Warring States period. The need for efficient and effective governance led to the development of Legalist ideas on statecraft, law, and administration.\n\nSima Qian\n----------\n\nSima Qian (145-86 BCE), a historian and astronomer, was one of the first scholars to study and write about Legalism. His work, the Records of the Grand Historian, provides valuable insights into the development of Legalist thought.\n\nHuang-Lao and Mawangdui\n----------------------\n\n### Huang-Lao and Laozi\n\nHuang-Lao, a philosophical school that emerged during the Warring States period, shared similarities with Legalism. Both schools emphasized the importance of natural order and the role of the ruler in maintaining social harmony. The Daodejing, a foundational text of Daoism, also influenced Huang-Lao thought.\n\n### Shen Dao and Zhuangzi\n\nShen Dao (c. 350-275 BCE) and Zhuangzi (369-286 BCE) were influential thinkers who contributed to the development of Huang-Lao and Daoist thought. Their ideas on the nature of reality, the role of the ruler, and the importance of non-action (wu wei) resonated with Legalist thinkers.\n\nChanging with the times\n----------------------\n\n### A.C. Graham\n\nThe British sinologist A.C. Graham (1919-1991) was a prominent scholar of Chinese philosophy. He argued that Legalism was not a coherent school of thought but rather a collection of ideas that evolved over time. Graham's work highlighted the dynamic nature of Chinese philosophy and the need to consider historical context when interpreting philosophical texts.\n\nConfucian influences\n-------------------\n\n### Shen Dao\n\nShen Dao, a Confucian scholar, was influenced by Legalist ideas on statecraft and law. His work, the Shenzi, demonstrates the incorporation of Legalist concepts into Confucian thought.\n\nXing-Ming and Wu wei\n-------------------\n\nXing-Ming, or \" Forms and Names,\" was a key concept in Legalist thought. It referred to the idea that social roles and responsibilities should be clearly defined and that individuals should be held accountable for their actions. Wu wei, or \"non-action,\" was another important concept that emphasized the need for the ruler to take action only when necessary.\n\nHan Feizi\n----------\n\nHan Feizi (280-233 BCE) was a prominent Legalist thinker and author of the Han Feizi. His work provides insights into the development of Legalist thought and its application to statecraft and governance.\n\n### Daodejing 17\n\nThe Daodejing, a foundational text of Daoism, contains passages that resonate with Legalist ideas. Chapter 17, for example, discusses the importance of natural order and the role of the ruler in maintaining social harmony.\n\nSchool of names\n----------------\n\nThe School of Names, a philosophical school that emerged during the Warring States period, was influenced by Legalist ideas on language and reality. The School of Names emphasized the importance of precise language and the need to clarify the meaning of words.\n\nEradicating punishments\n----------------------\n\n### Han Feizi\n\nHan Feizi argued that punishments should be severe and consistent to maintain social order. He believed that the ruler should use punishments to eradicate crime and promote social harmony.\n\n### Justice\n\nThe concept of justice was central to Legalist thought. Legalists believed that justice should be based on the law and that punishments should be fair and consistent.\n\nSources in Legalist Mythos\n---------------------------\n\n### Jia Yi (200–169 BCE)\n\nJia Yi, a Confucian scholar, wrote about the mythological origins of the Legalist school. His work, the Xinshu, provides insights into the development of Legalist thought and its relation to other philosophical schools.\n\n### Liu An (179–122 bce)\n\nLiu An, a scholar and alchemist, was influenced by Legalist ideas on statecraft and governance. His work, the Huainanzi, demonstrates the incorporation of Legalist concepts into other philosophical traditions.\n\n### The Fa School\n\nThe Fa School, a philosophical school that emerged during the Han dynasty, was influenced by Legalist ideas on law and governance. The Fa School emphasized the importance of clear laws and consistent punishments to maintain social order.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nSources\n--------\n\nExternal links\n---------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Legalism_(Chinese_philosophy)\" following this outline:\n\n#Retrospective current\n##Chapter 43 Ding fa\n##Imperial Confucian category\n#Military mobilization\n#Sima Qian\n#Huang-Lao and Mawangdui\n##Huang-Lao and Laozi\n##Shen Dao and Zhuangzi\n#Changing with the times\n##A.C.

The trophy is named after the Herder family, who were prominent figures in the province's hockey community. The Herder Memorial Trophy is one of the most coveted awards in junior hockey, symbolizing excellence and dedication to the sport.\n\n# History\n\nThe Herder Memorial Trophy was established in 1989, following the death of Jack Herder, a well-known hockey enthusiast and supporter. The trophy was donated by the Herder family to commemorate Jack's contributions to the sport and to promote junior hockey in Newfoundland and Labrador. Since its inception, the Herder Memorial Trophy has been awarded to the NLJHL champion, with the winner determined through a best-of-seven series.\n\n# The Herder family\n\nThe Herder family has a rich history in Newfoundland and Labrador, with a strong connection to the province's hockey community. Jack Herder, the patriarch of the family, was a passionate hockey fan and supporter. He was instrumental in promoting junior hockey in the province and was a key figure in the development of the NLJHL. The Herder family's commitment to hockey is still evident today, with family members continuing to be involved in the sport.\n\n# The trophy\n\nThe Herder Memorial Trophy is a silver cup with a wooden base, adorned with the names of past winners and the Herder family crest. The trophy is a symbol of excellence and dedication to junior hockey, and it is considered one of the most prestigious awards in the sport. The trophy is kept on display at the home arena of the NLJHL champion, and it is presented to the winner at the end of the championship series.\n\n# Conditions placed by the trophy donor\n\nWhen the Herder Memorial Trophy was donated, the family placed several conditions on its use. These conditions were designed to ensure that the trophy would be awarded in a fair and competitive manner, and that it would promote junior hockey in Newfoundland and Labrador. The conditions include:\n\n* The trophy will be awarded to the NLJHL champion, as determined through a best-of-seven series.\n* The series will be played between the winners of the NLJHL's two divisions.\n* The trophy will be presented to the winner at the end of the championship series.\n* The winner will be responsible for the care and maintenance of the trophy.\n* The trophy will be kept on display at the home arena of the NLJHL champion.\n\n## Exceptions to the original conditions\n\nOver the years, there have been several exceptions to the original conditions placed on the Herder Memorial Trophy. These exceptions have been made to accommodate changes in the NLJHL's structure and to ensure that the trophy continues to be awarded in a fair and competitive manner.\n\n### Condition #2\n\nIn 2002, the NLJHL was reorganized into a single division, rather than two. As a result, the condition that the series be played between the winners of the two divisions was no longer applicable. Instead, the series is now played between the top two teams in the league, based on their regular season standings.\n\n### Condition #4\n\nIn 2010, the NLJHL introduced a new playoff format, which included a round-robin series followed by a best-of-seven championship series. As a result, the condition that the winner be responsible for the care and maintenance of the trophy was modified to include the league's playoff champion, rather than just the winner of the best-of-seven series.\n\n### Condition #7\n\nIn 2015, the NLJHL introduced a new rule that requires the winner of the Herder Memorial Trophy to display the trophy at their home arena for a minimum of one year. This condition was added to ensure that the trophy is properly cared for and that it is available for display to fans and supporters.\n\n# Series format\n\nThe Herder Memorial Trophy is awarded to the winner of a best-of-seven series, played between the top two teams in the NLJHL. The series is typically played over a period of two weeks, with the winner advancing to the next round of the playoffs.\n\n## Series format history\n\nThe series format for the Herder Memorial Trophy has undergone several changes over the years. From 1989 to 2002, the series was played between the winners of the NLJHL's two divisions. In 2002, the league was reorganized into a single division, and the series is now played between the top two teams in the league. In 2010, the league introduced a new playoff format, which includes a round-robin series followed by a best-of-seven championship series.\n\n# Herder Champions\n\nThe Herder Memorial Trophy has been awarded to several teams over the years, including the St. John's Caps, the Mount Pearl Blades, and the Grand Falls-Windsor Cataracts. The St. John's Caps have won the trophy a record seven times, while the Mount Pearl Blades have won it five times.\n\n# Presentation ceremony and final game results\n\nThe Herder Memorial Trophy is presented to the winner at the end of the championship series. The presentation ceremony typically takes place on the ice, immediately following the final game. The ceremony includes the presentation of the trophy, as well as individual awards to the players and coaches of the winning team.\n\n# Finals appearances\n\nSeveral teams have appeared in the Herder Memorial Trophy finals over the years, including the St. John's Caps, the Mount Pearl Blades, and the Grand Falls-Windsor Cataracts. The St. John's Caps have appeared in the finals a record 11 times, while the Mount Pearl Blades have appeared in the finals eight times.\n\n# Cliff Gorman Memorial Award winners\n\nThe Cliff Gorman Memorial Award is presented annually to the most valuable player in the Herder Memorial Trophy finals. The award is named after Cliff Gorman, a former NLJHL player and coach who was instrumental in the development of the league. Several players have won the award over the years, including Tyler Boland, who won it in 2015.\n\n# Broadcasting\n\nThe Herder Memorial Trophy finals are typically broadcast on local television and radio stations, as well as online through streaming services. The broadcasts include play-by-play commentary, as well as analysis and interviews with the players and coaches.\n\n# References\n\n## Bibliography\n\n* \"Herder Memorial Trophy\".

However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the International Skating Union (ISU) announced on March 1, 2022, that the event would be relocated to a different venue. The championships were eventually held from March 21 to 27, 2022, in Montpellier, France.\n\n# Background\n\nThe 2022 World Figure Skating Championships were the 112th edition of the World Figure Skating Championships, a annual competition sanctioned by the International Skating Union (ISU). The event brought together the world's top figure skaters to compete in four disciplines: men's singles, women's singles, pairs, and ice dance. The championships were originally scheduled to take place in Montpellier, France, but due to unforeseen circumstances, the ISU announced a change of venue.\n\n## Controversy\n\nThe 2022 World Figure Skating Championships were marred by controversy due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The ISU announced on March 1, 2022, that Russian and Belarusian athletes would be banned from competing in the championships due to the ongoing conflict. This decision was met with criticism from some quarters, with some arguing that the ban was unfair to the athletes who were not directly involved in the conflict.\n\n# Qualification\n\nSkaters qualified for the 2022 World Figure Skating Championships through a variety of means. The top six finishers in each discipline at the 2021 World Figure Skating Championships earned a spot for their country at the 2022 championships. Additionally, skaters who finished in the top three at the 2021 European Figure Skating Championships, the 2021 Four Continents Figure Skating Championships, and the 2021 World Junior Figure Skating Championships also earned a spot for their country.\n\n## Age and minimum TES requirements\n\nSkaters competing in the 2022 World Figure Skating Championships had to meet certain age and minimum technical element score (TES) requirements. The minimum age requirement for senior skaters was 15 years old, while the minimum TES requirements varied by discipline. For men's singles and women's singles, the minimum TES requirement was 34.00 in the short program and 64.00 in the free skate. For pairs, the minimum TES requirement was 25.00 in the short program and 46.00 in the free skate. For ice dance, the minimum TES requirement was 28.00 in the rhythm dance and 44.00 in the free dance.\n\n## Number of entries per discipline\n\nEach country was allowed to send a maximum of three skaters per discipline to the 2022 World Figure Skating Championships. However, countries that had not earned a spot in a particular discipline could send one skater to compete as a \"host country\" entry.\n\n# Schedule\n\nThe 2022 World Figure Skating Championships took place from March 21 to 27, 2022. The schedule was as follows:\n\n* March 21: Men's singles short program\n* March 22: Women's singles short program\n* March 23: Pairs short program\n* March 24: Ice dance rhythm dance\n* March 25: Men's singles free skate\n* March 26: Women's singles free skate\n* March 27: Pairs free skate, ice dance free dance\n\n# Entries\n\nA total of 60 countries submitted entries for the 2022 World Figure Skating Championships. However, due to the ban on Russian and Belarusian athletes, the actual number of countries competing was lower.\n\n## Changes to preliminary entries\n\nThere were several changes to the preliminary entries for the 2022 World Figure Skating Championships. Some countries withdrew their entries due to the ban on Russian and Belarusian athletes, while others made changes to their entries due to injury or illness.\n\n# Medal summary\n\nThe 2022 World Figure Skating Championships saw a total of 12 medals awarded in four disciplines.\n\n## Medalists\n\nThe medalists at the 2022 World Figure Skating Championships were as follows:\n\n* Men's singles: Shoma Uno (Japan) - gold, Yuma Kagiyama (Japan) - silver, Nathan Chen (USA) - bronze\n* Women's singles: Kaori Sakamoto (Japan) - gold, Loena Hendrickx (Belgium) - silver, Alysa Liu (USA) - bronze\n* Pairs: Riku Miura / Ryuichi Kihara (Japan) - gold, Alexa Knierim / Brandon Frazier (USA) - silver, Vanessa James / Eric Radford (Canada) - bronze\n* Ice dance: Madison Chock / Evan Bates (USA) - gold, Victoria Sinitsina / Nikita Katsalapov (Russia) - silver, Piper Gilles / Paul Poirier (Canada) - bronze\n\n## Medals by country\n\nThe medals by country at the 2022 World Figure Skating Championships were as follows:\n\n* Japan - 3 gold, 1 silver, 0 bronze\n* USA - 1 gold, 2 silver, 2 bronze\n* Belgium - 0 gold, 1 silver, 0 bronze\n* Canada - 0 gold, 0 silver, 2 bronze\n\n# Records\n\nThe 2022 World Figure Skating Championships saw several records broken.

The term gained widespread attention due to the perceived contrast between the two films' subjects and tones, with \"Barbie\" being a light-hearted comedy and \"Oppenheimer\" being a biographical drama about the father of the atomic bomb.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\n### Release date dispute\n\nThe release date dispute surrounding Barbenheimer began when it was announced that both \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" would be released on the same day, July 21, 2023. This move was seen as unusual, as the two films cater to different audiences and have distinct tones. The decision was reportedly made by the studios behind the films, Warner Bros. and Universal Pictures, respectively.\n\n#### Public reaction\n\nThe public reaction to the release date dispute was largely one of surprise and amusement. Many people took to social media to express their confusion and curiosity about the simultaneous release of the two films. Some saw it as a clever marketing ploy, while others believed it would lead to a divide in audience attention.\n\n### Marketing\n\nThe marketing campaigns for \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" were distinct and catered to their respective target audiences. The \"Barbie\" campaign focused on showcasing the film's colorful and playful visuals, while the \"Oppenheimer\" campaign highlighted the film's dramatic and intense tone. Despite the differing marketing approaches, both films generated significant buzz and attention in the lead-up to their release.\n\n### Double feature viewing\n\nSome fans and enthusiasts took to social media to propose the idea of a \"double feature\" viewing, where audiences would watch both \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" back-to-back on the same day. This idea gained traction, with some theaters even offering special double feature screenings. The idea was seen as a fun and unique way to experience the two films, despite their vastly different subjects and tones.\n\nReception\n----------\n\n### Box office\n\n#### Projections\n\nPrior to their release, box office projections for \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" varied widely. Some analysts predicted that \"Barbie\" would perform well due to its broad appeal and strong marketing campaign, while others believed that \"Oppenheimer\" would struggle to find an audience due to its more niche subject matter.\n\n#### Gross\n\nThe box office gross for both films exceeded expectations. \"Barbie\" opened to a strong $155 million in the United States, while \"Oppenheimer\" debuted with a respectable $80 million. The combined gross of both films made for a significant opening weekend, with some analysts attributing the success to the unique release date strategy.\n\n### Film industry reaction\n\nThe film industry reaction to the Barbenheimer phenomenon was largely positive. Many industry insiders saw the simultaneous release of the two films as a clever marketing move, one that generated significant buzz and attention. Others praised the studios for taking a risk and trying something new.\n\n### Japanese response\n\nIn Japan, the Barbenheimer phenomenon was met with significant interest and attention. The country's film industry is known for its unique marketing strategies, and many Japanese fans and enthusiasts saw the simultaneous release of \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" as a fascinating experiment.\n\n### Analysis\n\nAnalysis of the Barbenheimer phenomenon has been widespread, with many pundits and critics attempting to make sense of the unique release date strategy. Some have argued that the success of the two films can be attributed to the contrast between their subjects and tones, while others believe that the studios' willingness to take a risk was the key factor.\n\n### Reviews\n\nReviews for \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" have been largely positive, with many critics praising the films for their unique qualities and strengths. \"Barbie\" was praised for its colorful visuals and playful tone, while \"Oppenheimer\" was lauded for its dramatic intensity and strong performances.\n\n### Accolades\n\nBoth \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" have received numerous accolades and awards, including several Academy Award nominations. The success of the two films has been seen as a significant achievement for the studios behind them, and has sparked renewed interest in the film industry's approach to marketing and distribution.\n\nCounterprogramming\n-----------------\n\n### Potential \"Glicked\" phenomenon\n\nThe Barbenheimer phenomenon has raised questions about the potential for a \"Glicked\" phenomenon, where two or more films are released simultaneously in an attempt to capitalize on their contrasting subjects and tones. Some analysts believe that this strategy could become more common in the future, as studios seek to generate buzz and attention in a crowded market.\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nThe Barbenheimer phenomenon has been the subject of significant attention and analysis, with many pundits and critics attempting to make sense of the unique release date strategy.

The Games were marked by numerous concerns and controversies, both before and during the event. This article summarizes the major issues that surrounded the 2022 Winter Olympics.\n\n# Criticism of Host Selection\n\nThe selection of Beijing as the host city for the 2022 Winter Olympics was met with criticism from various quarters. Many raised concerns about China's human rights record, particularly with regards to the treatment of ethnic minorities in the Xinjiang region. Others questioned the country's ability to host a successful Winter Olympics, given its lack of experience in hosting such events and the limited snowfall in the region.\n\nDespite these concerns, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) awarded the hosting rights to Beijing in 2015, citing the city's experience in hosting the 2008 Summer Olympics and its ability to deliver a successful Winter Games. However, the decision was widely criticized, with many accusing the IOC of ignoring the country's human rights record and environmental concerns.\n\n# Organizing Concerns and Controversies\n\n## Cost and Climate\n\nThe 2022 Winter Olympics were marked by concerns about the cost and environmental impact of the Games. The estimated cost of hosting the Olympics was around $3 billion, which was significantly lower than the original estimate of $6.5 billion. However, many questioned the accuracy of the estimates, pointing out that the actual cost of hosting the Games could be much higher.\n\nAnother major concern was the climate in Beijing, which is not well-suited for Winter Olympics. The city's average temperature in February is around 32°F (0°C), and snowfall is limited. To address this issue, the organizers had to rely heavily on artificial snowmaking, which raised concerns about the environmental impact of the Games.\n\n## Promotional Song\n\nThe promotional song for the 2022 Winter Olympics, titled \"The Snow-Kissed Song,\" was criticized for its lyrics, which were seen as overly nationalistic and focused on China's military power. Many felt that the song did not accurately reflect the spirit of the Olympics, which is supposed to promote unity and friendship among nations.\n\n# Diplomatic Boycotts or Non-Attendance\n\n## Background\n\nThe 2022 Winter Olympics were marked by diplomatic boycotts or non-attendance by several countries, citing concerns about China's human rights record and the treatment of Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang. The United States, Australia, and India were among the countries that announced diplomatic boycotts, while several other countries, including Germany and France, decided not to send high-level officials to the Games.\n\n## United States\n\nThe United States was one of the first countries to announce a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics. The decision was made by President Joe Biden, who cited concerns about China's human rights record and the treatment of Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang. The US team participated in the Games, but no high-level officials attended.\n\n## Australia\n\nAustralia also announced a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics, citing concerns about China's human rights record and the treatment of Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang. The Australian team participated in the Games, but no high-level officials attended.\n\n## India\n\nIndia was another country that announced a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics. The decision was made by the Indian government, which cited concerns about China's human rights record and the treatment of Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang. The Indian team participated in the Games, but no high-level officials attended.\n\n## Calls for Boycotts by Other Countries\n\nSeveral other countries, including Canada, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands, were called upon to boycott the 2022 Winter Olympics, citing concerns about China's human rights record and the treatment of Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang. However, these countries ultimately decided not to boycott the Games.\n\n## Chinese Government Response\n\nThe Chinese government responded to the diplomatic boycotts by accusing the participating countries of \"politicizing\" the Olympics. The government also claimed that the boycotts were \"unjustified\" and would not affect the success of the Games.\n\n## IOC Response\n\nThe IOC responded to the diplomatic boycotts by stating that the Olympics were a \"unifying\" force that brought countries together. The organization also claimed that the boycotts would not affect the success of the Games and that the focus should be on the athletes and their performances.\n\n# Athletes and Team Officials Complaints\n\n## Quarantine Facilities\n\nSeveral athletes and team officials complained about the quarantine facilities provided by the organizers. Many felt that the facilities were inadequate and did not meet the expected standards.\n\n## Food\n\nThere were also complaints about the food provided to athletes and team officials. Many felt that the food was not up to par and did not meet their dietary needs.\n\n## Weather Conditions\n\nThe weather conditions in Beijing were also a major concern for athletes and team officials. Many felt that the cold weather and limited snowfall affected their performances and made it difficult to prepare for the Games.\n\n# Team Russia\n\n## Russian Invasion of Ukraine\n\nThe Russian team at the 2022 Winter Olympics was marked by controversy due to the country's invasion of Ukraine. Many countries condemned Russia's actions, and there were calls for the Russian team to be banned from the Games.\n\n# Environmental and Health Issues\n\n## Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nThe 2022 Winter Olympics were held during the COVID-19 pandemic, which raised concerns about the health and safety of athletes and team officials. The organizers implemented several measures to mitigate the spread of the virus, including testing and quarantine protocols.\n\n## Insufficient Snowfall\n\nThe limited snowfall in Beijing was a major concern for the organizers, who had to rely heavily on artificial snowmaking. This raised concerns about the environmental impact of the Games.\n\n## Energy Crisis\n\nThere were also concerns about the energy crisis in China, which affected the hosting of the Games. The organizers had to rely on backup power sources to ensure that the Games could proceed smoothly.\n\n## Impact on Songshan National Nature Reserve\n\nThe hosting of the Games also raised concerns about the impact on the Songshan National Nature Reserve, which is located near the Olympic venues. Many felt that the Games would harm the environment and affect the wildlife in the reserve.\n\n# Human Rights Issues\n\n## Sportswashing\n\nThe 2022 Winter Olympics were accused of \"sportswashing,\" which refers to the practice of using sports events to improve a country's reputation and distract from human rights abuses.\n\n## Athlete Safety\n\nThere were concerns about the safety of athletes and team officials during the Games. Many felt that the organizers did not do enough to ensure their safety and security.\n\n## Athletes' Freedom of Speech\n\nThere were also concerns about the freedom of speech of athletes and team officials during the Games. Many felt that the organizers and the Chinese government restricted their ability to express themselves freely.\n\n## Protests\n\nThere were several protests during the Games, including a protest by Uyghur activists who called for an end to China's human rights abuses.\n\n# Propaganda and Information Operations Issues\n\n## Propaganda and Information Operations\n\nThe 2022 Winter Olympics were marked by propaganda and information operations by the Chinese government, which aimed to promote a positive image of the country and distract from human rights abuses.\n\n## Censorship\n\nThere were several instances of censorship during the Games, including the censorship of negative news about the Olympics and the Chinese government.\n\n### Negative News Censored During the Games\n\nSeveral news outlets reported that their coverage of the Games was censored by the Chinese government. Many felt that the government was trying to hide the truth about the Games and the human rights abuses in China.\n\n### Alleged Suspension of US Athlete's Twitter Account\n\nThere were also reports that the Twitter account of a US athlete was suspended during the Games. Many felt that the suspension was due to the athlete's criticism of the Chinese government and the Olympics.\n\n## Espionage Directed at Athletes\n\nThere were concerns about espionage directed at athletes and team officials during the Games. Many felt that the Chinese government was spying on them and collecting their personal data.\n\n## Sjoerd den Daas Incident\n\nThe Sjoerd den Daas incident, in which a Dutch journalist was forced to delete footage of a protest during the Games, raised concerns about the freedom of the press and the ability of journalists to report on the Olympics.\n\n# Olympic Torch Relay\n\nThe Olympic torch relay was marked by controversy due to the participation of several Chinese officials who were accused of human rights abuses.\n\n# Hanbok Row\n\nThe Hanbok row, in which a Korean athlete wore a hanbok, a traditional Korean dress, during the opening ceremony, raised concerns about cultural appropriation and the representation of Korean culture.\n\n# Accidents\n\nThere were several accidents during the Games, including a crash involving a bobsleigh team and a fall by a figure skater.\n\n# Taiwan Athlete Outfit Row\n\nThe Taiwan athlete outfit row, in which Taiwanese athletes wore outfits with the Chinese flag, raised concerns about the representation of Taiwan and the One-China policy.\n\n# Participation of Women\n\nThe participation of women in the Games was a major issue, with many countries fielding female athletes for the first time. However, there were also concerns about the representation of women in sports and the lack of opportunities for female athletes.\n\n# Sporting Controversies\n\n## Mixed Team Ski Jumping Normal Hill Event\n\nThe mixed team ski jumping normal hill event was marked by controversy due to the participation of several athletes who were accused of doping.\n\n## Mixed Team 2000 Metre Short-Track Speed-Skating Event\n\nThe mixed team 2000 metre short-track speed-skating event was marked by controversy due to a collision between two athletes, which affected the outcome of the event.\n\n## Men's 1000 Metre Short-Track Speedskating Event\n\nThe men's 1000 metre short-track speedskating event was marked by controversy due to a disqualification of an athlete, which affected the outcome of the event.\n\n## Women's 500 Metre Short-Track Speed-Skating Event\n\nThe women's 500 metre short-track speed-skating event was marked by controversy due to a collision between two athletes, which affected the outcome of the event.\n\n## Men's 5000 Metres Relay Short-Track Speed Skating Event\n\nThe men's 5000 metres relay short-track speed skating event was marked by controversy due to a disqualification of a team, which affected the outcome of the event.\n\n## Men's Snowboard Slopestyle\n\nThe men's snowboard slopestyle event was marked by controversy due to a judging error, which affected the outcome of the event.\n\n## Men's Snowboard Halfpipe\n\nThe men's snowboard halfpipe event was marked by controversy due to a judging error, which affected the outcome of the event.\n\n## Men's Speed Skating 500 Metres\n\nThe men's speed skating 500 metres event was marked by controversy due to a disqualification of an athlete, which affected the outcome of the event.\n\n## Figure Skating\n\nThe figure skating events were marked by controversy due to several judging errors, which affected the outcome of the events.\n\n## Men's Mass Start\n\nThe men's mass start event was marked by controversy due to a collision between two athletes, which affected the outcome of the event.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Concerns_and_controversies_at_the_2022_Winter_Olympics\" following this outline:\n\n#Criticism of host selection\n#Organizing concerns and controversies\n##Cost and climate\n##Promotional song\n#Diplomatic boycotts or non-attendance\n##Background\n##United States\n##Australia\n##India\n##Calls for boycotts by other countries\n##Chinese Government response\n##IOC response\n#Athletes and team officials complaints\n##Quarantine facilities\n##Food\n##Weather conditions\n#Team Russia\n##Russian invasion of Ukraine\n#Environmental and health issues\n##Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic\n##Insufficient snowfall\n##Energy crisis\n##Impact on Songshan National Nature Reserve\n#Human rights issues\n##Sportswashing\n##Athlete safety\n##Athletes' freedom of speech\n##Protests\n#Propaganda and information operations issues\n##Propaganda and information operations\n##Censorship\n###Negative news censored during the games\n###Alleged suspension of US athlete's Twitter account\n##Espionage directed at athletes\n##Sjoerd den Daas incident\n#Olympic torch relay\n#Hanbok row\n#Accidents\n#Taiwan athlete outfit row\n#Participation of women\n#Sporting controversies\n##Mixed team ski jumping normal hill event\n##Mixed team 2000 metre short-track speed-skating event\n##Men's 1000 metre short-track speedskating event\n##Women's 500 metre short-track speed-skating event\n##Men's 5000 metres relay short-track speed skating event\n##Men's snowboard slopestyle\n##Men's snowboard halfpipe\n##Men's speed skating 500 metres\n##Figure skating\n##Men's mass start\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations and the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS). The island is known for its stunning natural beauty, rich history, and vibrant culture.\n\nEtymology\n-----------\n\nThe name \"Saint Lucia\" is derived from the name of Saint Lucy, a Christian martyr who was venerated in the early Christian church. The island was named by the French, who established the first European settlement on the island in the 17th century.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\n### Pre-colonial period\n\nThe first inhabitants of Saint Lucia were the Arawak and Carib peoples, who migrated to the island from the mainland hundreds of years before the arrival of European colonizers. These indigenous peoples established a thriving society on the island, with their own system of government, agriculture, and culture.\n\n### Early European period\n\nIn 1498, Christopher Columbus sighted the island on his fourth voyage to the New World. However, it was not until 1605 that the first European settlement was established on the island by the British. The settlement was short-lived, and the island was later colonized by the French in 1642. The French established a series of forts and trading posts on the island, and began to cultivate the land for sugar and other crops.\n\n### 18th and 19th centuries\n\nDuring the 18th and 19th centuries, Saint Lucia was a key location in the struggle for control of the Caribbean between the British and French. The island changed hands several times, with the British eventually gaining control in 1814. During this period, the island's economy was largely based on sugar production, with thousands of enslaved Africans being brought to the island to work on plantations.\n\n### 20th century\n\nIn the early 20th century, Saint Lucia began to move towards independence from British colonial rule. The island became a self-governing colony in 1967, and gained full independence on February 22, 1979.\n\n### Post-independence era\n\nSince gaining independence, Saint Lucia has continued to develop its economy and improve the living standards of its citizens. The island has become a popular tourist destination, with visitors drawn to its stunning natural beauty and vibrant culture. The island has also become a key player in regional affairs, playing a leading role in the OECS and the Caribbean Community (CARICOM).\n\nGeography\n----------\n\n### Climate\n\nSaint Lucia has a tropical climate, with high temperatures and high levels of humidity throughout the year. The island is located in the hurricane belt, and is susceptible to hurricanes and other tropical storms.\n\n### Geology\n\nThe island is of volcanic origin, with a rugged landscape and numerous peaks and valleys. The highest point on the island is Mount Gimie, which rises to 950 meters (3,117 feet) above sea level.\n\nGovernment\n----------\n\n### Administrative divisions\n\nThe island is divided into 11 administrative districts, each with its own local government. The districts are:\n\n* Anse-la-Raye\n* Babonneau\n* Canaries\n* Castries\n* Choiseul\n* Dennery\n* Gros Islet\n* Laborie\n* Micoud\n* Soufrière\n* Vieux Fort\n\n### Law and crime\n\nThe island has a mixed legal system, with elements of both British and French law. The island has a relatively low crime rate compared to other Caribbean islands.\n\n### Foreign relations\n\nSaint Lucia is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations and the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS). The island has diplomatic relations with a number of countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada.\n\nEconomy\n--------\n\n### Tourism\n\nTourism is a major sector of the island's economy, with thousands of visitors arriving on the island each year. The island's natural beauty, including its beaches, rainforests, and volcanic peaks, is a major draw for tourists.\n\n### Agriculture\n\nAgriculture is also an important sector of the island's economy, with crops such as bananas, cocoa, and coconuts being major exports.\n\n### Infrastructure\n\nThe island has a well-developed infrastructure, with a international airport and a number of seaports. The island is also connected to the rest of the world by a number of telecommunications providers.\n\nDemographics\n------------\n\n### Ethnic groups\n\nThe island has a diverse population, with people of African, European, and indigenous descent. The majority of the population is of African descent, with a significant minority of people of mixed ancestry.\n\n### Languages\n\nThe official language of the island is English, but many people also speak Saint Lucian Creole, a French-based creole language.\n\n### Religion\n\nThe majority of the population is Christian, with a significant minority of people practicing other religions such as Hinduism and Islam.\n\n### Education\n\nThe island has a well-developed education system, with a number of primary and secondary schools, as well as a university.\n\n### Healthcare\n\nThe island has a relatively well-developed healthcare system, with a number of hospitals and health clinics.\n\nCulture\n--------\n\n### Media\n\nThe island has a number of newspapers, radio stations, and television stations, which provide news and entertainment to the population.\n\n### Music\n\nMusic is an important part of the island's culture, with a number of popular genres such as calypso and soca.\n\n### Food\n\nThe island's cuisine is a fusion of African, European, and indigenous influences, with popular dishes such as jerk chicken and rice and peas.\n\n### Sports\n\nThe island has a number of sports teams, including a national cricket team and a national football team.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* List of islands in the Caribbean\n* Commonwealth of Nations\n* Organization of Eastern Caribbean States\n\nNotes\n=====\n\nReferences\n==========\n\nSources\n-------\n\nExternal links\n==============", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Saint_Lucia\" following this outline:\n\n#Etymology\n#History\n##Pre-colonial period\n##Early European period\n##18th and 19th centuries\n##20th century\n##Post-independence era\n#Geography\n##Climate\n##Geology\n#Government\n##Administrative divisions\n##Law and crime\n##Foreign relations\n#Economy\n##Tourism\n##Agriculture\n##Infrastructure\n#Demographics\n##Ethnic groups\n##Languages\n##Religion\n##Education\n##Healthcare\n#Culture\n##Media\n##Music\n##Food\n##Sports\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n##Sources\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The Shahed 136 has gained significant attention in recent years due to its deployment in various conflict zones around the world.\n\nOverview\n--------\n\n### Description\n\nThe Shahed 136 is a small, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) designed to carry a high-explosive warhead. It has a length of approximately 2.5 meters (8.2 feet) and a wingspan of around 2.5 meters (8.2 feet). The drone is powered by a small engine and has a maximum takeoff weight of around 200 kilograms (440 pounds). The Shahed 136 has a low radar cross-section, making it difficult to detect and intercept.\n\n### Deployment\n\nThe Shahed 136 is typically deployed from a launcher, which can be mounted on a vehicle or a trailer. The drone is designed to be used in a \"fire-and-forget\" mode, where it is launched towards a target and then guided to its destination using a pre-programmed flight path.\n\n### Comms and guidance system\n\nThe Shahed 136 uses a combination of GPS and inertial navigation to guide itself to its target. It also has a radio communication system that allows it to receive updates and commands from its operator.\n\n### Electronics\n\nThe Shahed 136 has a relatively simple electronics system, which includes a flight control computer, a navigation system, and a communication system. The drone also has a warhead that is designed to detonate on impact.\n\nGeran-2\n--------\n\nThe Geran-2 is a Russian variant of the Shahed 136, which was produced in Russia in 2022. The Geran-2 has a number of modifications compared to the original Shahed 136, including a more powerful engine and a more advanced guidance system.\n\nCombat history\n--------------\n\n### Yemeni Civil War\n\nThe Shahed 136 was first used in combat in the Yemeni Civil War, where it was deployed by the Houthi rebels against the Saudi-led coalition. The drone was used to attack oil facilities, military bases, and other targets.\n\n### Russian invasion of Ukraine\n\n#### First appearances\n\nThe Shahed 136 was first used in Ukraine in September 2022, when it was deployed by Russian forces against Ukrainian targets. The drone was used to attack military bases, infrastructure, and civilian targets.\n\n#### October waves\n\nIn October 2022, Russia launched a series of massive drone attacks against Ukraine, using hundreds of Shahed 136 drones. The attacks targeted energy infrastructure, causing widespread power outages and damage.\n\n#### Ukrainian defense\n\nThe Ukrainian military has developed a number of strategies to counter the Shahed 136, including the use of anti-aircraft missiles and electronic warfare systems.\n\n#### Production in Russia\n\nIn 2022, Russia began producing the Geran-2, a variant of the Shahed 136, at a factory in the city of Yekaterinburg.\n\n#### Reactions\n\nThe use of the Shahed 136 in Ukraine has been widely condemned by Western countries, which have accused Russia of using Iranian drones to attack civilian targets.\n\n### 2022 Syria and Iraqi Kurdistan\n\nIn 2022, the Shahed 136 was used in Syria and Iraqi Kurdistan, where it was deployed by Iranian-backed militias against Kurdish targets.\n\n### 2023 Indian Ocean\n\nIn 2023, the Shahed 136 was used in the Indian Ocean, where it was deployed by Iranian forces against a tanker ship.\n\n### 2024 Iranian strikes on Israel\n\nIn 2024, Iran launched a series of drone strikes against Israel, using the Shahed 136 to attack military targets.\n\nClassification controversy\n-------------------------\n\nThe classification of the Shahed 136 has been the subject of controversy, with some countries classifying it as a drone and others classifying it as a missile.\n\nRelations with other Shahed drones\n---------------------------------\n\n### Shahed 131\n\nThe Shahed 131 is a smaller variant of the Shahed 136, which is designed for use in urban warfare.\n\n### Shahed 238\n\nThe Shahed 238 is a larger variant of the Shahed 136, which is designed for use in long-range attacks.\n\nOperators\n---------\n\nThe Shahed 136 is operated by a number of countries, including Iran, Russia, and the Houthi rebels in Yemen.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Loitering munition\n* Kamikaze drone\n* Suicide drone\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)\n\nExternal links\n---------------\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"HESA_Shahed_136\" following this outline:\n\n#Overview\n##Description\n##Deployment\n##Comms and guidance system\n##Electronics\n#Geran-2\n#Combat history\n##Yemeni Civil War\n##Russian invasion of Ukraine\n###First appearances\n###October waves\n###Ukrainian defense\n###Production in Russia\n###Reactions\n##2022 Syria and Iraqi Kurdistan\n##2023 Indian Ocean\n##2024 Iranian strikes on Israel\n#Classification controversy\n#Relations with other Shahed drones\n##Shahed 131\n##Shahed 238\n#Operators\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He is the longest-serving President in Italian history and the first to be elected for a second term. Napolitano's presidency was marked by significant events, including the 2008 financial crisis, the European sovereign-debt crisis, and the rise of the Five Star Movement. Throughout his career, Napolitano has been a prominent figure in Italian politics, known for his commitment to social democracy and his efforts to promote European integration.\n\n# Early life\n\nGiorgio Napolitano was born on June 29, 1925, in Naples, Italy. He came from a middle-class family and grew up in a culturally rich environment. Napolitano's parents were both educated and valued knowledge, encouraging their son to pursue his academic interests. He attended the Liceo Classico Giambattista Vico in Naples, where he developed a passion for classical studies and literature. After completing his secondary education, Napolitano enrolled in the University of Naples, where he studied law.\n\n# Early political career\n\n## World War II and anti-fascist resistance\n\nDuring World War II, Napolitano became involved in the anti-fascist resistance movement. In 1942, he joined the Italian Socialist Party, which was part of the underground resistance against the fascist regime. Napolitano's involvement in the resistance movement exposed him to the harsh realities of war and shaped his political views. After the war, he continued his studies, eventually earning a degree in law from the University of Naples.\n\n## From post-war years to the Hungarian Revolution of 1956\n\nIn the post-war years, Napolitano became increasingly involved in politics. He joined the Italian Communist Party (PCI) in 1945 and quickly rose through the ranks. Napolitano's early political career was marked by his involvement in the PCI's youth organization, the Italian Communist Youth Federation. He also served as a member of the PCI's central committee, where he played a key role in shaping the party's policies. The Hungarian Revolution of 1956 marked a significant turning point in Napolitano's career. He was part of a delegation that visited Hungary, where he witnessed the brutal suppression of the uprising. This experience had a profound impact on Napolitano, leading him to re-evaluate his views on communism and the role of the PCI in Italian politics.\n\n# Leading member of the Italian Communist Party\n\n## From the 1960s to 1980s\n\nIn the 1960s, Napolitano emerged as a leading figure in the PCI. He served as a member of the Italian Parliament, representing the PCI in the Chamber of Deputies. During this period, Napolitano played a key role in shaping the PCI's policies, particularly with regard to foreign policy and European integration. He was a strong advocate for Italy's membership in the European Economic Community (EEC) and played a key role in negotiating Italy's accession to the EEC in 1957. Napolitano's leadership within the PCI was marked by his efforts to promote a more liberal and democratic approach to communism. He was part of a faction within the party that sought to reform the PCI and make it more responsive to the needs of the Italian people.\n\n# After the Italian Communist Party\n\n## President of the Chamber of Deputies\n\nIn 1992, Napolitano was elected President of the Chamber of Deputies, a position he held until 1994. During his presidency, he played a key role in promoting reforms to the Italian electoral system and in strengthening the role of the parliament in Italian politics.\n\n## Late 1990s and early 2000s\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, Napolitano continued to play an active role in Italian politics. He served as a member of the Italian Senate and was a key figure in the Democratic Left party, which was formed in 1998. Napolitano's leadership within the party was marked by his efforts to promote a more liberal and social democratic approach to politics.\n\n# President of Italy\n\n## First term (2006–2013)\n\n### Election\n\nNapolitano was elected President of Italy on May 10, 2006, receiving 543 votes in the fourth round of voting. His election was seen as a significant victory for the center-left coalition, which had been in opposition for several years.\n\n### Prodi Cabinet\n\nDuring his first term, Napolitano played a key role in promoting stability and continuity in Italian politics. He worked closely with Prime Minister Romano Prodi, who formed a center-left government in 2006. Napolitano's relationship with Prodi was marked by a deep respect for the prime minister's efforts to promote economic reform and European integration.\n\n### 2008 political crisis\n\nIn 2008, Napolitano faced a significant challenge when the Prodi government was defeated in a confidence vote. Napolitano played a key role in promoting a peaceful transition of power, working closely with the leaders of the center-right coalition to form a new government.\n\n### Eluana Englaro incident\n\nIn 2009, Napolitano was involved in a highly publicized incident surrounding the case of Eluana Englaro, a young woman who had been in a coma for 17 years. Napolitano's decision to sign a decree allowing Englaro's feeding tube to be removed was seen as a significant challenge to the authority of the Italian parliament.\n\n### 2011 political crisis\n\nIn 2011, Napolitano faced another significant challenge when the Berlusconi government was defeated in a confidence vote. Napolitano played a key role in promoting a peaceful transition of power, working closely with the leaders of the center-left coalition to form a new government.\n\n## Second term (2013–2015)\n\n### Re-election\n\nNapolitano was re-elected President of Italy on April 20, 2013, receiving 738 votes in the sixth round of voting. His re-election was seen as a significant victory for the center-left coalition, which had been in opposition for several years.\n\n### Letta Cabinet\n\nDuring his second term, Napolitano worked closely with Prime Minister Enrico Letta, who formed a center-left government in 2013. Napolitano's relationship with Letta was marked by a deep respect for the prime minister's efforts to promote economic reform and European integration.\n\n### Renzi Cabinet\n\nIn 2014, Napolitano worked closely with Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who formed a center-left government. Napolitano's relationship with Renzi was marked by a deep respect for the prime minister's efforts to promote economic reform and European integration.\n\n## Resignation\n\nNapolitano resigned as President of Italy on January 14, 2015, citing his advanced age and declining health.\n\n## Later life\n\nAfter his resignation, Napolitano returned to private life. He has continued to play an active role in Italian politics, serving as a senator for life.\n\n# Personal life\n\n## Relations with the Catholic Church\n\nNapolitano has had a complex relationship with the Catholic Church throughout his career. While he has been critical of the Church's role in Italian politics, he has also sought to promote greater understanding and cooperation between the Church and the state.\n\n## Death and state funeral\n\nNapolitano died on September 22, 2023, at the age of 98. He was given a state funeral, which was attended by dignitaries from across Italy and Europe.\n\n# Legacy\n\nNapolitano's legacy is complex and multifaceted. He is remembered as a champion of social democracy and European integration, and his efforts to promote stability and continuity in Italian politics have been widely praised. However, his presidency was also marked by significant challenges, including the 2008 financial crisis and the European sovereign-debt crisis.\n\n# Electoral history\n\n## First-past-the-post

It is an independent branch of the Polish government, alongside the legislative and executive branches. The judiciary is composed of various types of courts and tribunals, including common courts, military courts, the Supreme Court, administrative courts, the Constitutional Tribunal, and the State Tribunal. The judiciary plays a crucial role in upholding the rule of law, protecting human rights, and ensuring the fair and impartial administration of justice in Poland.\n\n# Structure\n\n## Common courts\n\nCommon courts in Poland are the primary courts of general jurisdiction, responsible for hearing civil, criminal, and family cases. They are divided into two tiers: district courts (sądy rejonowe) and regional courts (sądy okręgowe). District courts are the first-instance courts, hearing cases involving less serious crimes and smaller civil claims. Regional courts, on the other hand, hear appeals from district courts and cases involving more serious crimes and larger civil claims.\n\n## Military courts\n\nMilitary courts in Poland are specialized courts responsible for hearing cases involving members of the Polish Armed Forces and other military personnel. They are divided into two tiers: military district courts (sądy wojskowe garnizonowe) and the High Military Court (Sąd Wojskowy Najwyższy). Military courts have jurisdiction over crimes committed by military personnel, as well as disciplinary cases.\n\n## Supreme Court\n\nThe Supreme Court (Sąd Najwyższy) is the highest court of appeal in Poland, responsible for hearing appeals from lower courts and ensuring the uniform application of the law. The Supreme Court has several chambers, each specializing in a particular area of law, such as civil, criminal, and labor law.\n\n## Administrative courts\n\nAdministrative courts in Poland are responsible for hearing cases involving administrative decisions and actions taken by government agencies and public officials. They are divided into two tiers: administrative courts (sądy administracyjne) and the Supreme Administrative Court (Naczelny Sąd Administracyjny). Administrative courts have jurisdiction over cases involving administrative decisions, such as those related to taxation, social security, and environmental protection.\n\n## Constitutional Tribunal\n\nThe Constitutional Tribunal (Trybunał Konstytucyjny) is a specialized court responsible for ensuring that laws and government actions are consistent with the Constitution of Poland. The Constitutional Tribunal has the power to strike down laws and government actions that are deemed unconstitutional.\n\n## State Tribunal\n\nThe State Tribunal (Trybunał Stanu) is a court responsible for hearing cases involving high-ranking government officials, including the President, Prime Minister, and members of the Council of Ministers. The State Tribunal has jurisdiction over cases involving crimes committed by these officials, as well as cases involving impeachment.\n\n# Procedure\n\nThe procedure for court proceedings in Poland varies depending on the type of case and the court hearing it. Generally, court proceedings involve the submission of written pleadings, the presentation of evidence, and the oral arguments of the parties involved. Decisions are typically made by a panel of judges, although some cases may be heard by a single judge.\n\n# Staff\n\n## Judges and court assessors\n\nJudges and court assessors in Poland are responsible for hearing cases and making decisions. They are appointed by the National Council of the Judiciary, a body composed of judges, lawyers, and other members of the judiciary.\n\n### National Council of the Judiciary\n\nThe National Council of the Judiciary (Krajowa Rada Sądownictwa) is a constitutional body responsible for appointing judges and ensuring the independence of the judiciary. The National Council is composed of 15 members, including judges, lawyers, and other members of the judiciary.\n\n#### Procedure of appointment\n\nThe procedure for appointing judges in Poland involves several steps. First, the National Council of the Judiciary advertises for applications from qualified candidates. Candidates must have a law degree and at least 10 years of experience as a lawyer or judge. The National Council then reviews the applications and selects candidates for interview. After the interview, the National Council recommends candidates for appointment to the President, who formally appoints them as judges.\n\n#### Rights and duties\n\nJudges in Poland have several rights and duties. They have the right to independence and impartiality, as well as the right to freedom from external influence. Judges are also required to uphold the Constitution and the law, and to ensure the fair and impartial administration of justice.\n\n## Judges sitting in the tribunals\n\nJudges sitting in the tribunals, including the Constitutional Tribunal and the State Tribunal, are appointed by the National Council of the Judiciary. These judges have specialized expertise in constitutional and administrative law.\n\n## Other judicial positions\n\nIn addition to judges, there are several other judicial positions in Poland, including court clerks, court administrators, and bailiffs. These positions are responsible for supporting the work of the courts and ensuring the smooth administration of justice.\n\n## Remuneration\n\nJudges and other judicial staff in Poland are remunerated by the state. Judges are paid a salary, which is set by the National Council of the Judiciary. Other judicial staff, such as court clerks and court administrators, are also paid a salary, which is set by the Ministry of Justice.\n\n# Minimal requirements\n\nTo become a judge in Poland, a candidate must meet certain minimal requirements. These include:\n\n* A law degree from a Polish university\n* At least 10 years of experience as a lawyer or judge\n* A good command of the Polish language\n* A clean record of conduct\n\n# Issues\n\n## Length of proceedings\n\nOne of the main issues affecting the judiciary in Poland is the length of proceedings. Many court cases take several years to complete, which can cause delays and frustration for parties involved.\n\n## Lack of popular support and trust\n\nAnother issue affecting the judiciary in Poland is the lack of popular support and trust. Many Poles have lost confidence in the judiciary, which they see as corrupt and ineffective.\n\n## Other issues\n\nThere are several other issues affecting the judiciary in Poland, including:\n\n* Corruption: There have been several high-profile cases of corruption involving judges and other judicial staff.\n* Inefficiency: The courts in Poland are often slow and inefficient, leading to delays and frustration for parties involved.\n* Lack of resources: The judiciary in Poland often lacks the resources it needs to function effectively, including modern technology and trained staff.\n\n## Rule of law concerns\n\nThere are several concerns about the rule of law in Poland, including:\n\n### Capture of the Constitutional Tribunal\n\nThe Constitutional Tribunal has been at the center of controversy in recent years, with many critics arguing that it has been captured by the ruling party.\n\n### Undue influence on judges\n\nThere have been several cases of undue influence on judges in Poland, including pressure from politicians and other external actors.\n\n### Partisan control of the National Council of the Judiciary\n\nThe National Council of the Judiciary has been criticized for being under the control of the ruling party, which has led to concerns about the independence of the judiciary.\n\n#### Arbitrary secondment of judges\n\nThere have been several cases of arbitrary secondment of judges in Poland, including the transfer of judges to lower courts or other roles.\n\n### Repercussions in Poland and abroad\n\nThe concerns about the rule of law in Poland have had several repercussions, both domestically and internationally.

The incident has sparked tensions between the United States and China, with both countries offering differing accounts of the balloon's purpose and intentions.\n\n# Background\n\n## History and Development of Reconnaissance Balloons\n\nReconnaissance balloons, also known as surveillance balloons or spy balloons, have been used for military and intelligence purposes since the mid-20th century. These balloons typically operate at high altitudes, using cameras and sensors to gather information about enemy territories, troop movements, and military installations. The use of balloons for reconnaissance purposes has been largely replaced by satellite imaging and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), but some countries continue to employ balloons due to their lower operating costs and ability to evade detection.\n\n### Past Chinese Balloons and Unidentified Objects\n\nThere have been several reported instances of Chinese balloons and unidentified objects entering U.S. airspace in recent years. In 2020, a Chinese high-altitude balloon was spotted over Hawaii, and in 2022, a Chinese reconnaissance balloon was detected over Alaska. In both cases, the U.S. military monitored the balloons but did not take action to intercept or down them.\n\n## U.S.–China Tensions\n\nTensions between the United States and China have been escalating in recent years, driven by a range of issues including trade, security, and human rights. The two countries have competing interests in the Asia-Pacific region, and the U.S. has been increasingly critical of China's military expansion and aggressive behavior in the South China Sea. The downing of the Chinese balloon has further strained relations between the two countries, with the U.S. accusing China of violating its sovereignty and China denying any wrongdoing.\n\n# Incident\n\n## Balloon\n\nThe balloon in question was a high-altitude reconnaissance balloon, estimated to be around 200 feet (60 meters) tall and weighing several thousand pounds. The balloon was equipped with a propulsion system, allowing it to navigate and change altitude, and carried a payload of sensors and cameras.\n\n### Size, Propulsion, and Payload\n\nThe exact specifications of the balloon are not publicly known, but experts have estimated its size and capabilities based on images and witness accounts. The balloon's propulsion system likely used a combination of solar panels and batteries to power its movements. The payload is believed to have included high-resolution cameras, sensors, and communication equipment.\n\n### Signals Intelligence Capabilities\n\nThe balloon's signals intelligence capabilities are not publicly known, but experts speculate that it may have been equipped with equipment to intercept and analyze communication signals. This could have included radio frequency (RF) interceptors, cell phone interceptors, or other types of signals intelligence gear.\n\n## Detection\n\nThe balloon was first detected by the U.S. military on January 28, 2023, when it entered Alaskan airspace. The U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM) and the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) were alerted, and the balloon was tracked as it moved over Canada and into the contiguous United States.\n\n## Flight Path\n\nThe balloon's flight path took it over several sensitive U.S. military sites, including Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana and F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming. The balloon also flew over several major cities, including Seattle, Washington, and Chicago, Illinois.\n\n## U.S. Monitoring and Counterintelligence\n\nThe U.S. military monitored the balloon's movements closely, using a combination of radar, satellites, and fighter jets to track its progress. The U.S. also took steps to protect its sensitive military sites, including increasing security measures and restricting access to classified information.\n\n## Downing\n\nOn February 4, 2023, the U.S. military downed the balloon using a single F-22 Raptor fighter jet. The downing occurred off the coast of South Carolina, and the debris was recovered by U.S. Navy and Coast Guard vessels.\n\n## Debris Recovery\n\nThe U.S. military recovered several pieces of debris from the balloon, including the payload and propulsion system. The debris is currently being analyzed by the U.S. intelligence community to determine the balloon's exact capabilities and intentions.\n\n# Legality of Airspace and Downing\n\nThe legality of the balloon's presence in U.S. airspace and the U.S. decision to down it are disputed. The U.S. claims that the balloon was in violation of its sovereignty and that it had the right to defend its airspace. China claims that the balloon was a civilian aircraft that strayed off course and that the U.S. had no right to shoot it down.\n\n# Response and Reactions\n\n## United States\n\nThe U.S. government has condemned China's actions, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken calling the incident a \"clear violation of U.S. sovereignty.\" The U.S. has also imposed sanctions on several Chinese companies and individuals involved in the production and operation of the balloon.\n\n## Canada\n\nCanada has expressed concern over the incident, with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau calling for greater transparency from China. Canada has also announced plans to increase its surveillance and monitoring of its airspace.\n\n## China\n\nChina has denied any wrongdoing, claiming that the balloon was a civilian aircraft that strayed off course. China has also accused the U.S. of overreacting and violating its sovereignty by downing the balloon.\n\n## NATO\n\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has expressed concern over the incident, with Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg calling for greater transparency from China. NATO has also announced plans to increase its surveillance and monitoring of its airspace.\n\n## Australia\n\nAustralia has expressed concern over the incident, with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese calling for greater transparency from China. Australia has also announced plans to increase its surveillance and monitoring of its airspace.\n\n## Japan\n\nJapan has expressed concern over the incident, with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida calling for greater transparency from China. Japan has also announced plans to increase its surveillance and monitoring of its airspace.\n\n## Singapore\n\nSingapore has expressed concern over the incident, with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong calling for greater transparency from China. Singapore has also announced plans to increase its surveillance and monitoring of its airspace.\n\n## United Kingdom\n\nThe United Kingdom has expressed concern over the incident, with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak calling for greater transparency from China. The UK has also announced plans to increase its surveillance and monitoring of its airspace.\n\n## Venezuela\n\nVenezuela has expressed support for China, with President Nicolas Maduro calling the U.S. decision to down the balloon a \"provocation.\"\n\n## Media Reactions\n\n### Analysis\n\nThe incident has been widely covered in the media, with many outlets analyzing the implications for U.S.-China relations and the future of reconnaissance balloons.\n\n### Satire\n\nThe incident has also been the subject of satire, with many comedians and commentators poking fun at the idea of a high-altitude balloon being used for espionage.\n\n# Other High-Altitude Objects in February 2023\n\nThere have been several other reported sightings of high-altitude objects in February 2023, including a possible Chinese balloon over Latin America and a possible Russian balloon over Europe. The exact nature and intentions of these objects are not publicly known.\n\n# Additional Assessments of the Balloon\n\nThe U.S. intelligence community has released several assessments of the balloon, including a report that it was likely used for reconnaissance purposes and a report that it may have been equipped with signals intelligence capabilities.\n\n# See Also\n\n* Reconnaissance balloon\n* Signals intelligence\n* U.S.-China relations\n* High-altitude surveillance\n\n# Notes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Chinese_balloon_incident\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##History and development of reconnaissance balloons\n###Past Chinese balloons and unidentified objects\n##U.S.–China tensions\n#Incident\n##Balloon\n###Size, propulsion, and payload\n###Signals intelligence capabilities\n##Detection\n##Flight path\n##U.S. monitoring and counterintelligence\n##Downing\n##Debris recovery\n#Legality of airspace and downing\n#Response and reactions\n##United States\n##Canada\n##China\n##NATO\n##Australia\n##Japan\n##Singapore\n##United Kingdom\n##Venezuela\n##Media reactions\n###Analysis\n###Satire\n#Other high-altitude objects in February 2023\n#Additional assessments of the balloon\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The team has a rich history, having participated in numerous international tournaments, including the FIFA World Cup and the Africa Cup of Nations. With a strong following and a talented pool of players, the Moroccan national team is one of the most successful and beloved teams in African football.\n\n# History\n\n## Pre-independence period\n\nThe history of football in Morocco dates back to the early 20th century, when the country was under French protectorate. The first football clubs were established in the 1920s, and the sport quickly gained popularity among the Moroccan population. In 1928, the Royal Moroccan Football Federation was founded, and the first national team was formed.\n\n## Beginning of Morocco (1955–1963)\n\nAfter Morocco gained independence in 1956, the national team began to participate in international competitions. The team's first match was against Iraq in 1957, which ended in a 3-3 draw. In the early 1960s, Morocco participated in several friendly matches against teams from North Africa and the Middle East.\n\n## First appearances in international competitions (1963–1976)\n\nMorocco's first appearance in a major international competition was in the 1964 African Cup of Nations, where the team finished third. In the 1970s, Morocco participated in several international tournaments, including the 1970 FIFA World Cup qualifiers and the 1972 African Cup of Nations.\n\n## Between successes and defeats (1976–1986)\n\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, Morocco experienced a period of fluctuating success. The team qualified for the 1976 African Cup of Nations, where they finished second, but failed to qualify for the 1982 FIFA World Cup. In 1984, Morocco won the African Cup Winners' Cup, defeating Nigeria 1-0 in the final.\n\n## Golden generation (1986–2000)\n\nThe late 1980s and 1990s are considered the golden years of Moroccan football. The team qualified for the 1986 FIFA World Cup, where they reached the round of 16, where they lost to West Germany. In the 1990s, Morocco won the 1991 African Cup of Nations, defeating Algeria 3-1 in the final. The team also qualified for the 1994 and 1998 FIFA World Cups.\n\n## Difficult years (2006–2017)\n\nIn the 2000s and 2010s, Morocco experienced a decline in success. The team failed to qualify for the 2006 and 2010 FIFA World Cups and was eliminated in the group stage of the 2013 and 2015 African Cup of Nations.\n\n## Second golden generation (2017–present)\n\nIn 2017, Morocco appointed Hervé Renard as the team's head coach, marking the beginning of a new era in Moroccan football. The team qualified for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, where they were eliminated in the group stage. In 2019, Morocco won the African Nations Championship, defeating Mali 2-0 in the final.\n\n# Home stadium\n\nThe Morocco national team plays its home matches at the Stade Mohammed V in Casablanca, which has a capacity of 67,000 spectators. The stadium has hosted numerous international matches, including the 1988 African Cup of Nations final.\n\n# Kit suppliers\n\nThe Morocco national team's kit supplier is Puma, who have been the team's official kit supplier since 2015.\n\n# Results and fixtures\n\n## 2023\n\n* March 23: Morocco vs. Brazil (friendly)\n* March 26: Morocco vs. Peru (friendly)\n* June 12: Morocco vs. South Africa (2023 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers)\n\n## 2024\n\n* January 10: Morocco vs. Ghana (2023 Africa Cup of Nations)\n* January 17: Morocco vs. Comoros (2023 Africa Cup of Nations)\n\n# Coaching staff\n\n## Coaching history\n\n* 1957-1960: Larbi Ben Barek\n* 1960-1961: Mohamed Massoun\n* 1961-1963: Mohamed Khairat\n* 1963-1964: Mohamed Massoun\n* 1964-1967: Abderrahmane Mahjoub\n* 1967-1968: Guy Claise\n* 1968-1969: Abderrahmane Mahjoub\n* 1970-1971: Blagoje Vidinić\n* 1971-1972: Abderrahmane Mahjoub\n* 1972-1973: Guy Claise\n* 1973-1975: Virgil Mărdărescu\n* 1975-1978: Abdellah Blinda\n* 1979-1980: Lotfi Benzarti\n* 1980-1983: Just Fontaine\n* 1983-1988: José Faria\n* 1988-1989: Jaime Valente\n* 1989-1990: Antonio Valentín\n* 1990-1992: Werner Olk\n* 1992-1994: Abdellah Blinda\n* 1994-1996: Mohammed Louzani\n* 1996-1998: José Faria\n* 1998-2000: Henri Michel\n* 2000-2002: Mustapha Madih\n* 2002-2005: Badou Zaki\n* 2005-2008: Mohamed Fakhir\n* 2008-2010: Roger Lemerre\n* 2010-2012: Eric Gerets\n* 2012-2014: Rachid Taoussi\n* 2014-2016: Badou Zaki\n* 2016-2019: Hervé Renard\n* 2019-present: Vahid Halilhodžić\n\n# Players\n\n## Current squad\n\nAs of March 2023\n\n* Goalkeepers: Yassine Bounou, Munir Mohamedi, Ahmed Reda Tagnaouti\n* Defenders: Achraf Hakimi, Noussair Mazraoui, Romain Saïss, Medhi Benatia, Sofyan Amrabat\n* Midfielders: Hakim Ziyech, Amine Harit, Ilias Chair, Adel Taarabt, Fayçal Fajr\n* Forwards: Youssef En-Nesyri, Munir El Haddadi, Sofiane Boufal, Ryan Mmaee\n\n## Recent call-ups\n\n* Goalkeepers: Abderrahman El Kass, Marouane Fakhr\n* Defenders: Omar El Kaddouri, Hamza Mendyl, Samy Mmaee\n* Midfielders: Mehdi Carcela, Oussama Idrissi, Ilias Haddad\n* Forwards: Ayoub El Kaabi, Adam Ounas\n\n## Previous squads\n\n* 2018 FIFA World Cup squad\n* 2019 Africa Cup of Nations squad\n* 2021 Africa Cup of Nations squad\n\n# Player records\n\n## Most appearances\n\nAs of March 2023\n\n1.

These wells pose significant environmental and financial risks to the province, landowners, and municipalities. This article provides an overview of the current situation, context, and responses to the issue of orphan wells in Alberta.\n\n# Current Overview\n\nAs of 2022, there are over 170,000 inactive oil and gas wells in Alberta, with approximately 97,000 of them considered \"orphaned.\" These wells are no longer producing and have been abandoned by their owners, often due to bankruptcy or financial insolvency. The number of orphan wells continues to grow, with an estimated 200-300 wells being added to the list each year.\n\n# Context\n\nThe oil and gas industry has been a significant contributor to Alberta's economy for decades. However, the decline of conventional oil and gas reserves, combined with low energy prices and increasing environmental regulations, has led to a surge in bankruptcies and abandoned wells. Many companies have gone out of business, leaving behind a legacy of orphaned wells that require costly reclamation and remediation.\n\n# Landowners and Municipalities\n\nLandowners and municipalities are often left to deal with the consequences of orphan wells. These wells can be a source of contamination, posing risks to soil, water, and air quality. Landowners may be unable to use their land for agricultural purposes or other activities due to the presence of orphan wells. Municipalities are also affected, as they may be responsible for providing emergency services and managing the environmental impacts of orphan wells.\n\n# Orphan Well Association\n\nThe Orphan Well Association (OWA) is a non-profit organization established in 2002 to manage and reclaim orphan wells in Alberta. The OWA is responsible for identifying and prioritizing orphan wells, as well as conducting reclamation and remediation work. The organization is funded through a combination of federal and provincial subsidies, as well as industry levies.\n\n# OWA Funding\n\n## Federal and Provincial Subsidies\n\nThe OWA receives funding from the federal and provincial governments to support its operations. In 2020, the federal government announced a $1.7 billion funding package to support the cleanup of orphan wells in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and British Columbia. The provincial government has also provided funding to support the OWA's work.\n\n# Alberta Energy Regulator\n\nThe Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) is responsible for regulating the oil and gas industry in Alberta. The AER has implemented various measures to address the issue of orphan wells, including requiring companies to provide financial security for well reclamation and remediation. However, some critics argue that the AER's regulations do not go far enough to prevent the creation of new orphan wells.\n\n# Legal and Regulatory Considerations\n\n## Polluter Pays Principle\n\nThe polluter pays principle is a fundamental concept in environmental law, which holds that those responsible for environmental damage should bear the costs of cleanup and remediation. In the case of orphan wells, the polluter pays principle is often compromised, as the responsible parties may have gone out of business or be unable to pay for reclamation and remediation.\n\n## Suspended Inactive Wells\n\nSuspended inactive wells are wells that are not currently producing but have not been officially abandoned. These wells can pose environmental risks, as they may not be properly maintained or monitored. The AER has implemented regulations to require companies to regularly inspect and maintain suspended inactive wells.\n\n# Bankruptcies and Orphan Wells\n\n## Strategic Packaging of Costly Liabilities with Productive Assets\n\nIn some cases, companies have been accused of strategically packaging costly liabilities, such as orphan wells, with productive assets in order to avoid responsibility for reclamation and remediation. This practice can make it difficult for regulators to hold companies accountable for their environmental obligations.\n\n# Environmental Impacts of Orphan Wells\n\n## Fugitive Gas Emissions\n\nOrphan wells can be a source of fugitive gas emissions, which contribute to climate change. A study by the Pembina Institute found that orphan wells in Alberta are releasing an estimated 7.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year.\n\n## Surface Casing Vent Flow (SCVF) and Gas Migration (GM)\n\nSurface casing vent flow (SCVF) and gas migration (GM) are two types of environmental hazards associated with orphan wells. SCVF occurs when gas escapes from the wellbore and vents to the surface, while GM occurs when gas migrates through the soil and rock formations. Both SCVF and GM can pose risks to soil, water, and air quality.\n\n# Potential Geothermal Conversion of Orphan Wells in Alberta\n\nSome researchers have suggested that orphan wells in Alberta could be converted for geothermal energy production. This would involve repurposing the wells to generate heat or electricity from underground reservoirs. While this idea is still in its infancy, it could potentially provide a new use for orphan wells and reduce their environmental impacts.\n\n# Responses\n\nThe issue of orphan wells in Alberta requires a coordinated response from government, industry, and civil society. Some potential responses include:\n\n* Increasing funding for the OWA to support reclamation and remediation efforts\n* Implementing stronger regulations to prevent the creation of new orphan wells\n* Encouraging industry to adopt best practices for well abandonment and reclamation\n* Supporting research and development of new technologies to convert orphan wells for geothermal energy production\n\n# See Also\n\n* List of oil and gas companies in Alberta\n* Environmental impact of the oil and gas industry\n* Geothermal energy in Canada\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a general overview of the issue of orphan wells in Alberta, Canada.

The crisis was sparked by a combination of factors, including rising interest rates, increased regulatory scrutiny, and concerns about the stability of the banking system.\n\n# Background\nThe banking crisis was preceded by a period of rapid growth in the US banking sector, fueled by low interest rates and a strong economy. However, as the Federal Reserve began to raise interest rates in 2022 to combat inflation, many banks found themselves facing increasing pressure on their balance sheets. Additionally, the collapse of the cryptocurrency market in 2022 led to a decline in deposits at some banks, further exacerbating the situation.\n\n# Liquidation of Silvergate Bank\n## Background\nSilvergate Bank was a California-based bank that specialized in serving the cryptocurrency industry. The bank had grown rapidly in recent years, but its business model was heavily dependent on the cryptocurrency market.\n\n## Events\nOn March 8, 2023, Silvergate Bank announced that it would be winding down its operations and liquidating its assets. The bank cited the decline in the cryptocurrency market and the resulting decline in deposits as the reason for its decision. The liquidation of Silvergate Bank was seen as a significant event in the banking industry, as it was the first major bank to fail in 2023.\n\n# Collapse of Silicon Valley Bank\n## Background\nSilicon Valley Bank was a California-based bank that specialized in serving the technology industry. The bank had grown rapidly in recent years, but its business model was heavily dependent on the tech industry.\n\n## Events\nOn March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank announced that it would be seeking additional capital to shore up its balance sheet. However, the bank's efforts to raise capital were unsuccessful, and on March 17, 2023, the bank was taken over by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank was seen as a major event in the banking industry, as it was the largest bank to fail in the US since the 2008 financial crisis.\n\n# Collapse of Signature Bank\n## Background\nSignature Bank was a New York-based bank that specialized in serving the cryptocurrency industry. The bank had grown rapidly in recent years, but its business model was heavily dependent on the cryptocurrency market.\n\n## Events\nOn March 12, 2023, Signature Bank announced that it would be taken over by the FDIC. The bank's collapse was seen as a significant event in the banking industry, as it was the second major bank to fail in 2023.\n\n# Collapse of First Republic Bank\n## Background\nFirst Republic Bank was a California-based bank that specialized in serving the wealthy. The bank had grown rapidly in recent years, but its business model was heavily dependent on the wealthy.\n\n## Events\nOn April 1, 2023, First Republic Bank announced that it would be taken over by JPMorgan Chase. The bank's collapse was seen as a significant event in the banking industry, as it was the fourth major bank to fail in 2023.\n\n# Aftermath\nThe collapse of the four major banks in 2023 had significant repercussions for the US banking industry. The events led to a decline in confidence in the banking system, and many banks faced increased pressure on their balance sheets.\n\n## Bank Term Funding Program\nIn response to the crisis, the Federal Reserve announced the creation of the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP). The program provided loans to banks for up to one year, collateralized by a wide range of assets. The BTFP was seen as a significant development, as it provided a lifeline to banks facing liquidity pressures.\n\n## Government discussion of other funding\nIn addition to the BTFP, the US government discussed other measures to provide funding to banks. These measures included the creation of a new bank deposit insurance fund and the provision of additional capital to banks.\n\n## U.S. investigations\nThe collapse of the four major banks in 2023 led to a number of investigations by US regulatory agencies. These investigations focused on the causes of the collapse and the role of regulatory failures.\n\n## Economic impact\nThe collapse of the four major banks in 2023 had significant economic implications. The events led to a decline in confidence in the banking system, and many businesses faced increased difficulty in accessing credit.\n\n## International impact\nThe collapse of the four major banks in 2023 also had significant international implications. The events led to a decline in confidence in the global banking system, and many countries faced increased pressure on their banking systems.\n\n# See also\n* 2008 financial crisis\n* Banking regulation\n* Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\n* Federal Reserve\n* Financial crisis", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_United_States_banking_crisis\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Liquidation of Silvergate Bank\n##Background\n##Events\n#Collapse of Silicon Valley Bank\n##Background\n##Events\n#Collapse of Signature Bank\n##Background\n##Events\n#Collapse of First Republic Bank\n##Background\n##Events\n#Aftermath\n##Bank Term Funding Program\n##Government discussion of other funding\n##U.S. investigations\n##Economic impact\n##International impact\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born in 1993 in Jallupur Khera village, Amritsar, Punjab, India, Singh rose to prominence as the leader of the organization Waris Punjab De.\n\nEarly Life\n-----------\n\nAmritpal Singh was born into a Sikh family in Jallupur Khera village, Amritsar, Punjab. His family was involved in farming, and Singh was the youngest of three siblings. He received his primary education at a local government school and later attended the Khalsa College in Amritsar. Singh was interested in Sikh history and culture from an early age and was influenced by the teachings of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, a prominent Sikh separatist leader.\n\nWaris Punjab De\n----------------\n\n### Succession to Deep Sidhu\n\nAmritpal Singh became involved with the organization Waris Punjab De, which was founded by Deep Sidhu, a Sikh activist and actor. Sidhu was a prominent figure in the Sikh separatist movement and had gained a significant following among young Sikhs. After Sidhu's death in a car accident in 2022, Singh succeeded him as the leader of Waris Punjab De.\n\n### Campaigning and Prachaar\n\nUnder Singh's leadership, Waris Punjab De continued to campaign for Sikh rights and separatism.

He set up rehabilitation centers and organized counseling sessions, which were well-received by the community.\n\n### Early Controversies\n\nHowever, Singh's methods of activism were not without controversy. He was criticized for his aggressive style of campaigning, which some saw as divisive and inflammatory. Singh was also accused of promoting hatred against other communities, particularly Hindus.\n\n### Khalistan and Bhindranwale Styling\n\nSingh's advocacy for Khalistan, a separate Sikh homeland, drew criticism from the Indian government and other opposition groups. He was also criticized for his admiration of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, whom he saw as a role model. Singh's styling, which included wearing a turban and carrying a sword, was also seen as an attempt to emulate Bhindranwale.\n\nPolitical Career\n-----------------\n\n### Member of Parliament\n\nIn 2022, Singh contested the Punjab state assembly elections as an independent candidate. Although he lost the election, he gained significant attention and support from the Sikh community.\n\nParticipation in Violence\n-------------------------\n\n### Ajnala Clash\n\nIn 2022, Singh was involved in a violent clash with police in Ajnala, Punjab. The clash occurred during a protest rally organized by Waris Punjab De, which turned violent when police attempted to disperse the crowd. Singh was accused of inciting the violence and was later arrested.\n\nCrackdown and Arrest\n--------------------\n\n### Allegations and Charges\n\nIn 2023, the Indian government launched a crackdown on Waris Punjab De, accusing the organization of promoting separatism and violence. Singh was arrested and charged with various offenses, including sedition and promoting enmity between communities.\n\n### Reactions\n\n#### Domestic\n\nThe crackdown on Waris Punjab De drew criticism from opposition parties and human rights groups, who accused the government of suppressing dissent and freedom of speech.\n\n#### International\n\nThe international community also expressed concern over the crackdown, with some countries calling for the release of Singh and other detained activists.\n\nPersonal Life\n-------------\n\nAmritpal Singh is married and has two children. He is a devout Sikh and follows the teachings of the Sikh Gurus. Despite the controversy surrounding him, Singh remains a popular figure among young Sikhs, who see him as a champion of Sikh rights and separatism.\n\nSee Also\n--------\n\n* Waris Punjab De\n* Deep Sidhu\n* Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale\n* Khalistan movement\n\nNotes\n------\n\nThis article is a factual account of Amritpal Singh's life and activities.
