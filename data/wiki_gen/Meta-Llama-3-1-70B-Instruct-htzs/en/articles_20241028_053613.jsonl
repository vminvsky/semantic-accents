The party is affiliated with the Green Party of the United States and is part of the global Green movement. The party's platform is based on the Ten Key Values of the Green Party, which include grassroots democracy, social justice, ecological wisdom, nonviolence, decentralization, community-based economics, feminism, respect for diversity, personal and global responsibility, and future focus.\n\n# History\n\n## Qualifying for elections\n\nThe Green Party of California qualified for the ballot in 1992, after submitting over 100,000 signatures to the Secretary of State. This allowed the party to participate in the 1992 elections, including the presidential election. Ross Perot's candidacy in the 1992 presidential election drew attention away from the Green Party's nominee, but the party still managed to secure over 1% of the vote in the state.\n\n## Electoral milestones\n\nThe Green Party of California has had several electoral milestones over the years. In 2000, the party's nominee for U.S. Senate, Medea Benjamin, won over 3% of the vote.

In 2006, the party's nominee for Lieutenant Governor, Donna Warren, won over 2% of the vote.\n\n## Top-two primaries\n\nIn 2010, California voters approved Proposition 14, which established the top-two primary system. Under this system, the top two candidates in the primary election, regardless of party affiliation, advance to the general election. This has made it more difficult for Green Party candidates to qualify for the general election. However, the party has continued to participate in elections and has had success in local elections.\n\n# Platform\n\nThe Green Party of California's platform is based on the Ten Key Values of the Green Party. The party's platform includes planks on social justice, environmental protection, economic democracy, and peace. The party supports a wide range of issues, including single-payer healthcare, free public education, and an end to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nThe party's environmental platform includes support for renewable energy, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and protecting California's natural resources. The party also supports social justice issues, including racial justice, LGBTQ+ rights, and immigrant rights.\n\n# Organization\n\n## Membership\n\nThe Green Party of California has a membership-based structure. Members can join the party through the state party's website or through local chapters. The party has a dues-paying membership structure, with membership levels ranging from $10 to $100 per year.\n\nThe party has a number of local chapters throughout the state, which are responsible for organizing local campaigns and events. The party also has a number of caucuses, including the Lavender Green Caucus, the Latino Green Caucus, and the Disability Rights Caucus.\n\n# Current elected officials\n\n## Mayoral offices\n\nThe Green Party of California has a number of elected officials at the local level. One of the party's most notable elected officials is Gayle McLaughlin, who was elected mayor of Richmond in 2006 and re-elected in 2010. McLaughlin was a key figure in the city's efforts to reduce crime and improve public safety.\n\n## Municipal councils\n\nThe party has a number of elected officials on municipal councils throughout the state. One of the party's most notable elected officials is Jesse Arreguin, who was elected to the Berkeley City Council in 2008 and re-elected in 2012. Arreguin was a key figure in the city's efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote sustainable development.\n\n# Election results\n\n## Presidential\n\nThe Green Party of California has participated in every presidential election since 1992. The party's nominees have included Ross Perot, Ralph Nader, and Jill Stein.\n\n* 1992: Ross Perot - 1.1% of the vote\n* 1996: Ralph Nader - 2.1% of the vote\n* 2000: Ralph Nader - 3.8% of the vote\n* 2004: David Cobb - 1.3% of the vote\n* 2008: Cynthia McKinney - 0.6% of the vote\n* 2012: Jill Stein - 0.6% of the vote\n* 2016: Jill Stein - 1.4% of the vote\n\n## Gubernatorial\n\nThe Green Party of California has participated in every gubernatorial election since 1994.

The referendums were organized by the Russian-backed authorities in the occupied territories, with the aim of annexing these regions to Russia. The votes were widely condemned by Ukraine and the international community, who considered them to be illegitimate and a violation of Ukraine's sovereignty.\n\n# Background\n\nThe idea of holding referendums in the occupied territories of Ukraine was first proposed by the Russian-backed separatist leaders in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in 2021. The proposal was initially met with skepticism by the Russian authorities, but gained momentum in 2022, following the launch of Russia's large-scale invasion of Ukraine in February.\n\nThe Russian government claimed that the referendums were necessary to allow the people of the occupied territories to express their will and determine their future. However, Ukraine and the international community argued that the votes were a sham, designed to legitimize Russia's annexation of Ukrainian territory.\n\n# Organization\n\nThe organization of the referendums was overseen by the Russian-backed authorities in the occupied territories, with the assistance of Russian officials. The votes were held in four regions: Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia.\n\nThe referendums were organized in a rushed manner, with little time for campaigning or debate. The questions to be put to the voters were not made public until the eve of the vote, and the voting process was shrouded in secrecy.\n\n# Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts\n\n## Questions\n\nThe question put to voters in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions was: \"Do you support the entry of the Donetsk People's Republic/Zaporizhzhia Oblast into the Russian Federation as a federal subject?\"\n\n## Results\n\nAccording to the official results, 99.23% of voters in the Donetsk region and 98.42% of voters in the Luhansk region supported the annexation of their regions to Russia. The turnout was reported to be 97.51% in Donetsk and 92.6% in Luhansk.\n\n# Kherson Oblast\n\n## Question\n\nThe question put to voters in the Kherson region was: \"Do you support the entry of the Kherson Oblast into the Russian Federation as a federal subject?\"\n\n## Result\n\nAccording to the official results, 87.05% of voters in the Kherson region supported the annexation of their region to Russia. The turnout was reported to be 78.86%.\n\n# Zaporizhzhia Oblast\n\n## Question\n\nThe question put to voters in the Zaporizhzhia region was: \"Do you support the entry of the Zaporizhzhia Oblast into the Russian Federation as a federal subject?\"\n\n## Result\n\nAccording to the official results, 93.11% of voters in the Zaporizhzhia region supported the annexation of their region to Russia. The turnout was reported to be 85.38%.\n\n# Other planned locations\n\n## Mykolaiv Oblast\n\nThe Russian-backed authorities in the Mykolaiv region had planned to hold a referendum on annexation, but the vote was postponed due to the ongoing fighting in the region.\n\n## Kharkiv Oblast\n\nThe Russian-backed authorities in the Kharkiv region had also planned to hold a referendum on annexation, but the vote was cancelled due to the Ukrainian military's advances in the region.\n\n# Opinion polls\n\nThere were no independent opinion polls conducted in the occupied territories to gauge public opinion on the annexation referendums. However, polls conducted in Ukraine and among Ukrainian refugees suggested that a majority of Ukrainians opposed the annexation of their country's territory by Russia.\n\n# Opinions on the goals of holding referendums\n\nThe Ukrainian government and many international observers believed that the referendums were a pretext for Russia to annex Ukrainian territory and legitimize its occupation. The Russian government claimed that the referendums were necessary to allow the people of the occupied territories to express their will and determine their future.\n\n# Conduct\n\n## First day\n\nThe referendums began on September 23, with voters in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions casting their ballots. The voting process was peaceful, but there were reports of irregularities and intimidation of voters.\n\n## Second day\n\nOn the second day of voting, September 24, voters in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions cast their ballots. The voting process was again peaceful, but there were reports of irregularities and intimidation of voters.\n\n## Third day\n\nOn the third day of voting, September 25, voters in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions continued to cast their ballots. The voting process was peaceful, but there were reports of irregularities and intimidation of voters.\n\n## Fourth day\n\nOn the fourth day of voting, September 26, voters in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions continued to cast their ballots. The voting process was peaceful, but there were reports of irregularities and intimidation of voters.\n\n## Fifth day\n\nOn the fifth and final day of voting, September 27, voters in all four regions cast their ballots. The voting process was peaceful, but there were reports of irregularities and intimidation of voters.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## Ukraine\n\nThe Ukrainian government condemned the referendums, calling them a \"sham\" and a \"violation of international law.\" Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that the referendums were a \"pretext for Russia to annex Ukrainian territory.\"\n\n## Russia\n\nThe Russian government welcomed the results of the referendums, saying that they reflected the will of the people in the occupied territories. Russia's President Vladimir Putin said that the referendums were a \"democratic expression of the people's will.\"\n\n## International organisations\n\nThe United Nations, the European Union, and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) all condemned the referendums, saying that they were illegitimate and a violation of Ukraine's sovereignty.\n\n## Countries\n\nMany countries, including the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, condemned the referendums and refused to recognize the results. China and India were among the few countries that did not condemn the referendums.\n\n## Human rights organizations\n\nHuman Rights Watch and Amnesty International condemned the referendums, saying that they were a \"sham\" and a \"violation of human rights.\"\n\n## Other\n\nThe referendums were also condemned by many other organizations and individuals, including the Ukrainian diaspora and human rights activists.\n\n# Possible consequences\n\nThe annexation of Ukrainian territory by Russia could have significant consequences for the region and the world. It could lead to further instability and conflict in Ukraine, and could also have implications for the global economy and international relations.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe aftermath of the referendums saw a significant escalation of the conflict in Ukraine, with both sides suffering heavy losses. The international community continued to condemn Russia's actions, and many countries imposed sanctions on Russia in response to the annexation.\n\n# See also\n\n## Likewise referendums\n\n* 2014 Crimean status referendum\n* 2014 Donbass status referendums\n\n## Irredentism\n\n* Russian irredentism\n* Ukrainian irredentism\n\n## Geopolitical aspects\n\n* Russia–Ukraine relations\n* Ukraine–European Union relations\n* Ukraine–NATO relations\n\n# References\n\n# External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_annexation_referendums_in_Russian-occupied_Ukraine\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Organization\n#Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts\n##Questions\n##Results\n#Kherson Oblast\n##Question\n##Result\n#Zaporizhzhia Oblast\n##Question\n##Result\n#Other planned locations\n##Mykolaiv Oblast\n##Kharkiv Oblast\n#Opinion polls\n#Opinions on the goals of holding referendums\n#Conduct\n##First day\n##Second day\n##Third day\n##Fourth day\n##Fifth day\n#Reactions\n##Ukraine\n##Russia\n##International organisations\n##Countries\n##Human rights organizations\n##Other\n#Possible consequences\n#Aftermath\n#See also\n##Likewise referendums\n##Irredentism\n##Geopolitical aspects\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He is often referred to as the \"Father of the Constitution\" for his role in drafting and promoting the United States Constitution and the Bill of Rights.\n\nEarly life and education\n------------------------\n\nJames Madison was born in Port Conway, Virginia, to Colonel James Madison Sr. and Nelly Conway Madison. He was the oldest of 12 children, and his family was considered to be of moderate means. Madison received a classical education at Innes Creek School and later attended the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University), where he studied law, philosophy, and politics. After graduating in 1771, Madison returned to Virginia and began to study law, but he never pursued a career in law, instead focusing on politics.\n\nAmerican Revolution and Articles of Confederation\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nDuring the American Revolution, Madison served as a member of the Virginia House of Delegates and later as a delegate to the Continental Congress. In 1784, he was appointed to the Virginia House of Delegates, where he became a leader in the fight for independence from Great Britain. Madison played a key role in the drafting of the Articles of Confederation, the first constitution of the United States, but he was ultimately dissatisfied with the final product.\n\nRatification of the Constitution\n---------------------------------\n\nIn 1787, Madison was a key delegate to the Constitutional Convention, where he played a leading role in drafting the United States Constitution. He worked closely with other Founding Fathers, including George Washington and Alexander Hamilton, to create a new form of government that would replace the Articles of Confederation. Madison's contributions to the Constitution were significant, and he is often credited with drafting the document's framework and many of its key provisions.\n\nCongressman and party leader (1789–1801)\n------------------------------------------\n\n### Election to Congress\n\nIn 1789, Madison was elected to the United States House of Representatives, where he became a leader in the fight for a strong central government. He was a key ally of President George Washington and played a crucial role in the passage of several key pieces of legislation, including the Tariff Act of 1789 and the Jay Treaty.\n\n### Bill of Rights\n\nIn 1789, Madison was tasked with drafting a Bill of Rights, a set of amendments to the Constitution that would protect individual liberties. Madison drew heavily on the Virginia Declaration of Rights, which had been drafted by George Mason in 1776. The Bill of Rights was ratified in 1791 and has since become a cornerstone of American law.\n\n### Founding the Democratic–Republican Party\n\nIn 1792, Madison, along with Thomas Jefferson, founded the Democratic-Republican Party, which would become a major force in American politics for decades to come. The party was formed in opposition to the Federalist Party, which was led by Alexander Hamilton.\n\n### Marriage and family\n\nIn 1794, Madison married Dolley Payne Todd, a wealthy widow who was 17 years his junior. The couple had no children together, but Madison adopted Dolley's son from her previous marriage.\n\n### Adams presidency\n\nDuring the presidency of John Adams, Madison became increasingly opposed to the Federalist Party's policies, particularly the Alien and Sedition Acts. Madison and Jefferson wrote the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions, which argued that the states had the right to nullify federal laws that they deemed unconstitutional.\n\nSecretary of State (1801–1809)\n------------------------------\n\nIn 1801, Madison was appointed Secretary of State by President Thomas Jefferson. During his time in office, Madison played a key role in the Louisiana Purchase, which doubled the size of the United States. He also oversaw the Lewis and Clark Expedition, which explored the western territories of the United States.\n\n### 1808 presidential election\n\nIn 1808, Madison was elected as the fourth President of the United States, defeating Charles C. Pinckney in the general election.\n\nPresidency (1809–1817)\n------------------------\n\n### Inauguration and cabinet\n\nMadison was inaugurated as President on March 4, 1809. He appointed a cabinet that included James Monroe as Secretary of State and Robert Smith as Secretary of the Navy.\n\n### War of 1812\n\n#### Prelude to war\n\nDuring Madison's presidency, tensions between the United States and Great Britain increased, particularly over issues such as impressment of American sailors and trade restrictions. In 1812, Madison asked Congress to declare war on Great Britain, which they did on June 18, 1812.\n\n#### Military actions\n\nThe War of 1812 was fought on several fronts, including land battles in the north and naval battles on the Great Lakes and the Atlantic Ocean. The war was marked by several key American victories, including the Battle of Lake Erie and the Battle of the Thames.\n\n### Postwar period and decline of the Federalist opposition\n\nAfter the War of 1812, the Federalist Party declined in influence, and the Democratic-Republican Party became the dominant force in American politics. Madison oversaw the signing of the Treaty of Ghent, which ended the war, and he worked to rebuild the American economy.\n\n### Native American policy\n\nDuring Madison's presidency, he oversaw the forced relocation of several Native American tribes, including the Creek and the Seminole. Madison believed that the Native American tribes should be assimilated into white culture, and he supported the creation of Indian schools and missions.\n\n### Election of 1816\n\nIn 1816, Madison declined to run for re-election, and James Monroe was elected as his successor.\n\nPost-presidency (1817–1836)\n---------------------------\n\nAfter leaving office, Madison retired to his estate at Montpelier, where he lived until his death in 1836. During his retirement, Madison remained active in politics and continued to advocate for the causes that he had supported during his presidency.\n\n### Death\n\nJames Madison died on June 28, 1836, at the age of 85. He was buried on the grounds of Montpelier, where his wife Dolley was buried several years later.\n\nPolitical and religious views\n-----------------------------\n\n### Federalism\n\nMadison was a strong supporter of federalism, which he believed was essential to the survival of the United States. He believed that a strong central government was necessary to regulate commerce, provide for national defense, and enforce the law.\n\n### Religion\n\nMadison was a member of the Episcopal Church, and he believed in the importance of separating church and state. He supported the principle of religious freedom and opposed the establishment of a national church.\n\nSlavery\n--------\n\nMadison owned slaves throughout his life, and he struggled with the moral implications of slavery. In his later years, Madison became increasingly opposed to slavery, and he supported the colonization of freed slaves in Africa.\n\nLegacy\n--------\n\nJames Madison is remembered as one of the most important figures in American history. He played a key role in the drafting of the United States Constitution and the Bill of Rights, and he served as President during the War of 1812. Madison's legacy continues to be felt today, and he remains an important figure in American politics and law.\n\nNotes\n------\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nSources\n-------\n\nFurther reading\n---------------\n\nExternal links\n--------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"James_Madison\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and education\n#American Revolution and Articles of Confederation\n#Ratification of the Constitution\n#Congressman and party leader (1789–1801)\n##Election to Congress\n##Bill of Rights\n##Founding the Democratic–Republican Party\n##Marriage and family\n##Adams presidency\n#Secretary of State (1801–1809)\n##1808 presidential election\n#Presidency (1809–1817)\n##Inauguration and cabinet\n##War of 1812\n###Prelude to war\n###Military actions\n##Postwar period and decline of the Federalist opposition\n##Native American policy\n##Election of 1816\n#Post-presidency (1817–1836)\n##Death\n#Political and religious views\n##Federalism\n##Religion\n#Slavery\n#Legacy\n#Notes\n#References\n##Citations\n##Sources\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The area has been a focal point of concern in recent years due to the growing number of people struggling with homelessness and addiction, and the resulting impact on local businesses and residents.\n\nAftermath of Long Island closure\n\nThe area of Mass. and Cass began to attract attention in 2014, when the City of Boston closed the Long Island shelter and recovery services due to structural concerns with the bridge connecting the island to the mainland. The closure resulted in the relocation of over 700 people to various shelters and services in the city, with many ending up in the area of Mass. and Cass.\n\nClosure of Long Island services\n\nThe closure of the Long Island shelter and recovery services was intended to be temporary, but it ultimately became permanent. The city cited the high cost of repairing the bridge and the need to prioritize other infrastructure projects. However, the closure had a significant impact on the people who relied on the services, many of whom were struggling with addiction and homelessness.\n\nShelter openings at Mass. and Cass\n\nIn response to the closure of the Long Island shelter, the city opened several new shelters in the area of Mass. and Cass. These shelters were intended to provide temporary housing and services to those in need, but they quickly became overcrowded and understaffed.

As a key figure in the Second Viennese School, Webern's music had a profound impact on the course of Western classical music, influencing generations of composers to come.\n\nBiography\n==========\n\n### 1883–1908: Upbringing between late Imperial Vienna and countryside\n\n#### Bucolic Heimat\n\nWebern was born on December 3, 1883, in Vienna, Austria, to a family of civil servants. His childhood was marked by frequent moves between Vienna and the countryside, where his family would often spend their summers. This bucolic upbringing would later influence his music, which often reflects a deep connection to nature.\n\n#### University\n\nWebern began his musical studies at the University of Vienna, where he earned a doctorate in musicology in 1906. During his time at university, he was exposed to the works of Richard Wagner and Richard Strauss, which would later influence his compositional style.\n\n#### Schoenberg and his circle\n\nIn 1904, Webern met Arnold Schoenberg, who would become his mentor and friend. Schoenberg's innovative and avant-garde compositional style had a profound impact on Webern, who soon became a devoted student of Schoenberg's. Through Schoenberg, Webern was introduced to a circle of like-minded musicians, including Alban Berg and Erwin Stein.\n\n### 1908–1918: Early adulthood in Austria-Hungary and German Empire\n\n#### Marriage\n\nIn 1911, Webern married Wilhelmine Mörtl, with whom he would have three children. The couple settled in Mödling, a suburb of Vienna, where Webern would spend much of his life.\n\n#### Early conducting career\n\nWebern began his conducting career in 1908, leading the chorus of the Vienna Singverein. He would go on to conduct various ensembles throughout Austria and Germany, including the Vienna Symphony Orchestra.\n\n#### Psychotherapy\n\nIn 1913, Webern underwent psychotherapy with Alfred Adler, a prominent Austrian psychiatrist. This experience would later influence his music, which often explores themes of psychological introspection.\n\n#### \"Old song\" of \"lost paradise\"\n\nWebern's early music is characterized by a sense of nostalgia for a lost paradise. This theme is reflected in his song cycle, \"Entflieht auf leichten Kähnen\" (1908), which sets texts by Stefan George.\n\n#### World War I\n\nDuring World War I, Webern served in the Austro-Hungarian Army, stationed in Vienna. The war had a profound impact on his music, which became increasingly somber and introspective.\n\n#### Austrian defeat and socioeconomic strain\n\nFollowing Austria's defeat in the war, the country was plunged into socioeconomic crisis. Webern's music from this period reflects the sense of disorientation and disillusionment that characterized the era.\n\n### 1918–1933: Rise in Rotes Wien (Interwar Vienna)\n\n#### Society for Private Musical Performances\n\nIn 1918, Webern co-founded the Society for Private Musical Performances, a organization dedicated to promoting new music. The society would play a key role in promoting Webern's music, as well as that of his contemporaries.\n\n#### Mature conducting career\n\nDuring the 1920s, Webern's conducting career flourished, with appointments at the Vienna Symphony Orchestra and the German Opera House in Berlin.\n\n#### Relative success in a destabilizing society\n\nDespite the socioeconomic turmoil of the era, Webern's music enjoyed relative success during the 1920s. His music was championed by critics such as Paul Bekker, who recognized Webern's innovative compositional style.\n\n### 1933–1938: Perseverance in Schwarzes Wien (Austrofascist Vienna)\n\n#### Marginalization at home\n\nFollowing the rise of Austrofascism in Austria, Webern's music was increasingly marginalized. His Jewish heritage and association with Schoenberg, who was Jewish, made him a target for anti-Semitic persecution.\n\n#### Besieged milieu and political confusion\n\nThe Austrofascist regime's cultural policies were marked by confusion and inconsistency. Webern's music was occasionally promoted, but more often it was suppressed or marginalized.\n\n#### Visiting conducting career\n\nDuring the 1930s, Webern's conducting career took him to various cities throughout Europe, including Paris and Amsterdam.\n\n### 1938–1939: Inner emigration in Nazi Germany\n\n#### Anschluss\n\nFollowing the Anschluss, Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany. Webern's music was immediately banned, and he was forced into inner emigration.\n\n#### Kristallnacht and recoil\n\nThe Kristallnacht pogrom in 1938 marked a turning point for Webern, who was deeply shocked by the violence and hatred unleashed against Jewish communities.\n\n### 1939–1945: Hope and disillusionment during World War II\n\n#### Swiss and Reich prospects\n\nDuring World War II, Webern's music was occasionally performed in Switzerland, which remained neutral throughout the conflict. However, his prospects for a conducting career in Germany were non-existent.\n\n#### Wartime hopes and reality\n\nWebern's music from this period reflects a sense of hope and disillusionment. His String Quartet (1937-1938) is a masterpiece of somber introspection.\n\n#### Refuge and death in Mittersill\n\nIn 1945, Webern was accidentally shot and killed by an American soldier in Mittersill, Austria, where he had sought refuge.\n\nMusic\n=====\n\nWebern's music is characterized by a unique blend of atonality and serialism. His compositional style evolved significantly over the course of his career, reflecting his responses to changing cultural and historical contexts.\n\n### 1899–1908: Formative juvenilia and emergence from study\n\nWebern's early music is marked by a sense of experimentation and discovery. His String Quartet (1905) is a key work from this period, showcasing his emerging compositional style.\n\n### 1908–1914: Atonality and aphorisms\n\nWebern's music from this period is characterized by a sense of fragmentation and dislocation. His Six Pieces for Orchestra (1913) are a masterpiece of atonal innovation.\n\n### 1914–1924: Mid-period Lieder\n\nWebern's Lieder from this period are marked by a sense of introspection and psychological complexity. His settings of texts by Stefan George and Rainer Maria Rilke are particularly notable.\n\n### 1924–1945: Formal coherence and expansion\n\nWebern's music from this period is characterized by a sense of formal coherence and expansion. His String Quartet (1937-1938) is a masterpiece of serialist innovation.\n\n### Arrangements and orchestrations\n\nWebern was a prolific arranger and orchestrator, working on music by Bach, Mozart, and Schubert, among others. His arrangements of Debussy's Preludes are particularly notable.\n\nReception, influence, and legacy\n==================================\n\nWebern's music had a profound impact on the development of Western classical music. His innovative compositional style influenced generations of composers, from Pierre Boulez to Elliott Carter.\n\n### Performance practice\n\nWebern's music is characterized by a sense of complexity and difficulty. His music requires a high degree of technical skill and interpretive insight.\n\n### Contemporaries\n\nWebern's contemporaries included a range of notable composers, including Arnold Schoenberg, Alban Berg, and Igor Stravinsky.\n\n#### Artists\n\nWebern's music was often championed by artists and intellectuals, including Paul Klee and Wassily Kandinsky.\n\n#### Musicians\n\nWebern's music was performed by a range of notable musicians, including the Vienna Symphony Orchestra and the German Opera House in Berlin.\n\n### 1947–1950s: (Re)discovery and post-Webernism\n\nFollowing World War II, Webern's music experienced a significant resurgence in popularity. His music was championed by composers such as Pierre Boulez and Karlheinz Stockhausen.\n\n### 1950s onward: Beyond (late) Webern\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, Webern's music continued to influence a range of composers, from Elliott Carter to György Ligeti.\n\n### Eastern Europe\n\nWebern's music had a significant impact on Eastern European composers, particularly in Poland and Hungary.\n\n#### Eastern Bloc\n\nWebern's music was occasionally performed in the Eastern Bloc, despite the cultural and ideological tensions of the era.\n\n#### Soviet Russia\n\nWebern's music was largely suppressed in Soviet Russia, due to its association with Western modernism and avant-gardism.\n\n### Dance\n\nWebern's music has been used in a range of dance productions, including works by Merce Cunningham and Pina Bausch.\n\n### Since the 1980s: Reappraisals and historiography\n\nIn recent years, Webern's music has undergone significant reappraisal and reevaluation. His music is now recognized as a key part of the Western classical tradition.\n\nRecordings by Webern\n=====================\n\nWebern made a range of recordings throughout his career, including performances of his own music and music by other composers.\n\nNotes\n=====\n\nThis article is a comprehensive overview of Anton Webern's life and music.

The sixth named storm and fourth hurricane of the 2022 Atlantic hurricane season, Fiona developed from a tropical wave that emerged from the west coast of Africa on August 30, 2022.\n\n# Meteorological history\n\nFiona's origins can be traced back to a tropical wave that emerged from the west coast of Africa on August 30, 2022. The wave moved westward across the tropical Atlantic, gradually developing a closed circulation and increasing convection. On September 1, 2022, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began issuing advisories on the system, designating it as Tropical Depression Seven. Over the next few days, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm and was given the name Fiona.\n\nFiona moved westward across the Atlantic, passing north of the Lesser Antilles on September 3, 2022. As it approached the northeastern Caribbean, the storm began to strengthen more rapidly, developing a well-defined eye and intense thunderstorms. On September 5, 2022, Fiona reached hurricane strength, with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (120 km/h). Over the next few days, the hurricane continued to strengthen, reaching a peak intensity of 125 mph (205 km/h) on September 7, 2022.\n\nAfter passing through the northeastern Caribbean, Fiona turned northward and began to interact with a mid-latitude trough. This interaction caused the hurricane to weaken slightly, but it still maintained a strong circulation and significant convection. On September 10, 2022, Fiona made landfall in Nova Scotia, Canada, as a post-tropical cyclone, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall to the region.\n\n# Preparations\n\nAs Fiona approached the Caribbean, several islands issued tropical storm watches and warnings, with some countries declaring states of emergency. In Guadeloupe, authorities ordered the evacuation of several coastal communities, while in Puerto Rico, the government activated its emergency management agency and deployed troops to assist with evacuations and relief efforts.\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, the government issued a red alert, the highest level of warning, and ordered the evacuation of thousands of people from low-lying areas. The country's president, Luis Abinader, declared a state of emergency and deployed troops to assist with relief efforts.\n\nIn Bermuda, the government issued a tropical storm warning and advised residents to prepare for strong winds and heavy rainfall. In Eastern Canada, Environment and Climate Change Canada issued a hurricane watch, warning of strong winds and heavy rainfall.\n\n# Impact\n\n## Guadeloupe\n\nFiona brought strong winds and heavy rainfall to Guadeloupe, causing widespread damage and power outages. The storm made landfall on September 3, 2022, with maximum sustained winds of 70 mph (110 km/h). The island's capital, Basse-Terre, was severely affected, with reports of flooding and landslides.\n\n## Puerto Rico\n\nFiona made landfall in Puerto Rico on September 4, 2022, with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph (140 km/h). The storm caused widespread damage and power outages, with reports of flooding and landslides. The island's emergency management agency reported that over 1 million people were left without electricity.\n\n## Dominican Republic\n\nFiona made landfall in the Dominican Republic on September 5, 2022, with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph (160 km/h). The storm caused widespread damage and power outages, with reports of flooding and landslides. The country's emergency management agency reported that over 2 million people were left without electricity.\n\n## Turks and Caicos\n\nFiona brought strong winds and heavy rainfall to the Turks and Caicos Islands, causing widespread damage and power outages. The storm made landfall on September 6, 2022, with maximum sustained winds of 90 mph (150 km/h).\n\n## Antigua\n\nFiona brought strong winds and heavy rainfall to Antigua, causing widespread damage and power outages. The storm made landfall on September 7, 2022, with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph (130 km/h).\n\n## Bermuda\n\nFiona brought strong winds and heavy rainfall to Bermuda, causing widespread damage and power outages. The storm made landfall on September 8, 2022, with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (120 km/h).\n\n## Eastern Canada\n\nFiona made landfall in Nova Scotia, Canada, on September 10, 2022, as a post-tropical cyclone, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall to the region. The storm caused widespread damage and power outages, with reports of flooding and landslides.\n\n# Aftermath\n\n## Puerto Rico\n\nThe aftermath of Fiona's passage through Puerto Rico was marked by widespread damage and power outages. The island's emergency management agency reported that over 1 million people were left without electricity, and thousands of homes were damaged or destroyed.\n\n## Dominican Republic\n\nThe aftermath of Fiona's passage through the Dominican Republic was marked by widespread damage and power outages. The country's emergency management agency reported that over 2 million people were left without electricity, and thousands of homes were damaged or destroyed.\n\n# Retirement\n\nThe name Fiona was retired from the list of Atlantic hurricane names in 2023, due to the extensive damage and loss of life caused by the storm.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of Atlantic hurricanes\n* List of retired Atlantic hurricane names\n\n# References\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)\n\n# External links\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Hurricane_Fiona\" following this outline:\n\n#Meteorological history\n#Preparations\n#Impact\n##Guadeloupe\n##Puerto Rico\n##Dominican Republic\n##Turks and Caicos\n##Antigua\n##Bermuda\n##Eastern Canada\n#Aftermath\n##Puerto Rico\n##Dominican Republic\n#Retirement\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The cyclone caused significant damage, displacement, and loss of life, prompting widespread responses from governments, civil society, and individuals.\n\n#Meteorological history\n\nCyclone Gabrielle formed on February 6, 2023, as a low-pressure system in the Coral Sea, northeast of Australia. The system gradually intensified, and by February 8, it had developed into a tropical cyclone, with sustained winds of 65 km/h (40 mph). Over the next few days, Gabrielle continued to strengthen, reaching category 3 cyclone status on the Australian tropical cyclone scale.\n\nAs Gabrielle approached the coast of Melanesia, it began to interact with a mid-latitude trough, causing the cyclone to slow down and change direction. This interaction also led to an increase in Gabrielle's wind field, with the cyclone's outer rain bands affecting several islands in the region.\n\nOn February 12, Gabrielle made landfall on the North Island of New Zealand, bringing strong winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surges to several regions. The cyclone continued to move southward, affecting various parts of the country before dissipating on February 15.\n\n#Effects\n\n##Melanesia\n\nCyclone Gabrielle brought significant impacts to several countries in Melanesia, including Vanuatu, Solomon Islands, and Papua New Guinea. The cyclone's outer rain bands caused flooding, landslides, and power outages in these countries.\n\nIn Vanuatu, the cyclone damaged several homes and buildings, with reports of families displaced from their homes. The government of Vanuatu declared a state of emergency and activated its disaster response plan to assist affected communities.\n\nIn the Solomon Islands, Gabrielle caused widespread damage to infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and buildings. The cyclone also affected several communities, with reports of families forced to evacuate their homes due to flooding.\n\n##Norfolk Island\n\nCyclone Gabrielle passed close to Norfolk Island, a small Australian territory in the Pacific, on February 11. The cyclone brought strong winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surges to the island, causing significant damage to buildings and infrastructure.\n\nThe Australian government provided support to the island's residents, including emergency supplies and personnel. The island's airport was also closed due to the cyclone, with flights suspended until further notice.\n\n##New Zealand\n\nCyclone Gabrielle had a significant impact on New Zealand, with several regions affected by strong winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surges.\n\n###Northland\n\nNorthland was one of the hardest-hit regions, with widespread damage to buildings, roads, and infrastructure. The cyclone also caused significant flooding, with several communities affected.\n\n###Auckland\n\nAuckland, the country's largest city, experienced strong winds and heavy rainfall, causing damage to buildings and infrastructure. The cyclone also caused widespread power outages, with thousands of households affected.\n\n###Waikato\n\nWaikato, a region in the north of the North Island, experienced significant impacts from the cyclone, including flooding and damage to infrastructure. The cyclone also caused power outages, with several communities affected.\n\n###Gisborne\n\nGisborne, a region on the east coast of the North Island, experienced significant damage from the cyclone, including flooding and damage to buildings and infrastructure.\n\n###Hawke's Bay\n\nHawke's Bay, a region on the east coast of the North Island, experienced significant impacts from the cyclone, including flooding and damage to infrastructure. The cyclone also caused power outages, with several communities affected.\n\n###Manawatū-Whanganui\n\nManawatū-Whanganui, a region in the southwest of the North Island, experienced significant impacts from the cyclone, including flooding and damage to infrastructure.\n\n###Other regions\n\nOther regions in New Zealand, including the Bay of Plenty, Taranaki, and the West Coast, also experienced significant impacts from the cyclone, including flooding, damage to buildings and infrastructure, and power outages.\n\n#Responses\n\n##New Zealand\n\nThe New Zealand government responded quickly to the cyclone, with the Prime Minister declaring a state of emergency on February 13. The government activated its disaster response plan, with emergency services, including the military, deployed to affected regions.\n\n###Relief\n\nThe government provided significant relief to affected communities, including emergency supplies, shelter, and financial assistance. The government also established a relief fund to support affected individuals and communities.\n\n###Government\n\nThe government established a ministerial committee to oversee the response to the cyclone. The committee was responsible for coordinating the government's response, including the deployment of emergency services and the provision of relief to affected communities.\n\n###Civil society\n\nCivil society organizations, including non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and community groups, played a significant role in responding to the cyclone. These organizations provided emergency assistance, including food, shelter, and clothing, to affected communities.\n\n###Inquiries\n\nThe government established an inquiry into the cyclone, to examine the causes and consequences of the disaster. The inquiry was also tasked with identifying lessons learned and making recommendations for future disaster response and recovery.\n\n###Managed retreat\n\nThe government considered managed retreat as a long-term solution to the impacts of the cyclone. Managed retreat involves the relocation of communities from high-risk areas to safer locations. The government recognized that managed retreat would require significant planning and resources, but acknowledged that it could be an effective way to reduce the risk of future disasters.\n\n#Retirement\n\nCyclone Gabrielle was retired from the list of tropical cyclone names by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) due to the significant damage and loss of life caused by the cyclone. The WMO retires names of tropical cyclones that cause significant damage and loss of life, to avoid using names that may be associated with traumatic events.\n\n#See also\n\n* Cyclone\n* Tropical cyclone\n* Pacific cyclone season\n* List of retired tropical cyclone names\n\n#References\n\n(Note: This section is not included as per the requirements)\n\n#External links\n\n(Note: This section is not included as per the requirements)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Cyclone_Gabrielle\" following this outline:\n\n#Meteorological history\n#Effects\n##Melanesia\n##Norfolk Island\n##New Zealand\n###Northland\n###Auckland\n###Waikato\n###Gisborne\n###Hawke's Bay\n###Manawatū-Whanganui\n###Other regions\n#Responses\n##New Zealand\n###Relief\n###Government\n###Civil society\n###Inquiries\n###Managed retreat\n#Retirement\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The strikes have targeted various aspects of Ukraine's critical infrastructure, including power plants, transmission lines, and water treatment facilities, with the aim of weakening the country's ability to function and resist Russian aggression.\n\n#Background\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022, with a large-scale military operation aimed at capturing key cities and strategic locations. As the conflict progressed, Russia began to target Ukraine's critical infrastructure, including power plants, bridges, and roads, in an effort to weaken the country's ability to resist.\n\nThe strikes against Ukrainian infrastructure were a deliberate tactic employed by Russia to exert pressure on Ukraine and its allies, and to create a humanitarian crisis that would force Ukraine to the negotiating table. The strikes were also seen as an attempt to disrupt Ukraine's economy and create widespread suffering among the civilian population.\n\n#Timeline\n\n##September 2022\n\nThe first major strike against Ukrainian infrastructure occurred on September 11, 2022, when Russia launched a wave of missile strikes against power plants and transmission lines across Ukraine.

The case, which has garnered significant attention and controversy, centers on Trump's attempts to subvert the election outcome and his potential involvement in the January 6, 2021, attack on the United States Capitol.\n\n# Background\n\n## Accusations of Electoral Fraud and Attempts to Overturn the Election\n\nFollowing his loss to Democratic candidate Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election, Trump and his allies began making unfounded claims of widespread electoral fraud. Despite a lack of evidence, Trump repeatedly asserted that the election had been \"stolen\" from him and that he was the rightful winner. This narrative was promoted by Trump's campaign, as well as various conservative media outlets and social media platforms.\n\nIn the weeks and months following the election, Trump and his supporters attempted to overturn the results through various means, including filing lawsuits, pressuring state officials, and lobbying members of Congress to reject the certification of Biden's victory. These efforts ultimately failed, and Biden was inaugurated as the 46th President of the United States on January 20, 2021.\n\n## January 6 Capitol Attack and Investigations\n\nOn January 6, 2021, a mob of Trump supporters stormed the United States Capitol, seeking to disrupt the certification of Biden's victory. The attack resulted in the deaths of five people, including a police officer, and injured over 140 others. The event was widely condemned, and Trump's role in inciting the violence has been the subject of intense scrutiny.\n\nIn the aftermath of the attack, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) launched an investigation into the events surrounding the storming of the Capitol. This investigation has led to the indictment of numerous individuals, including some with ties to Trump's campaign and administration.\n\n# Original Indictment and Arraignment\n\nOn June 8, 2023, a federal grand jury returned an indictment against Trump, charging him with four felony counts related to his alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. The indictment, which was unsealed the following day, marked the first time a former U.S. president had been charged with a crime.\n\nTrump was arraigned on June 13, 2023, and pleaded not guilty to all four counts. The arraignment was held in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, with Judge Tanya S. Chutkan presiding.\n\n# Superseding Indictment and Arraignment\n\nOn August 1, 2023, a superseding indictment was returned against Trump, adding new allegations and charges to the original indictment. The superseding indictment also included additional co-conspirators, expanding the scope of the case.\n\nTrump was arraigned on the superseding indictment on August 24, 2023, and again pleaded not guilty to all charges.\n\n# Statements in the Indictment\n\nThe indictment and superseding indictment contain numerous allegations and statements regarding Trump's actions and intentions. These statements provide insight into the government's case against Trump and highlight the key events and players involved.\n\n## Allegations and Statements\n\nThe indictment alleges that Trump engaged in a widespread scheme to defraud the United States and obstruct the certification of the 2020 presidential election. This scheme, according to the government, involved numerous individuals and entities, including Trump's campaign, administration officials, and outside advisors.\n\n## Count One: Conspiracy to Defraud the United States\n\nCount One of the indictment charges Trump with conspiracy to defraud the United States, a felony offense that carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison.

Bagley is a former CIA officer and author who served for over 20 years in the agency's Clandestine Service, primarily in the Soviet Bloc. Bagley is best known for his involvement in several high-profile espionage cases, including the Pyotr Popov, Michal Goleniewski, and Yuri Nosenko cases. His experiences and insights have been documented in his book \"Spy Wars: Moles, Mysteries, and Deadly Games,\" which provides a unique perspective on the CIA-KGB rivalry during the Cold War era.\n\n#Early life and education\n\nTennent H. Bagley was born on August 15, 1925, in the United States. He grew up in a family with a strong interest in international affairs and languages. Bagley's early education took place at various American schools in Europe, where his family resided due to his father's diplomatic career. He later attended Yale University, where he earned a degree in languages and international relations.\n\n#Career\n\nBagley joined the CIA in 1952, shortly after graduating from Yale. He began his career in the Clandestine Service, which focused on gathering human intelligence through espionage and clandestine operations. Bagley's language skills and knowledge of European cultures made him an ideal candidate for assignments in the Soviet Bloc. Over the course of his career, he worked in several CIA stations, including those in Berlin, Vienna, and Moscow.\n\n##Bagley's Analysis of the KGB-CIA War\n\nDuring his time in the CIA, Bagley developed a deep understanding of the KGB's tactics and strategies. He recognized that the KGB's primary goal was to infiltrate and manipulate Western intelligence agencies, rather than simply gathering intelligence. Bagley's analysis of the KGB-CIA war, as described in his book \"Spy Wars,\" highlights the complexities and nuances of the espionage game. He argues that the CIA's focus on gathering intelligence often led to a reactive approach, whereas the KGB's strategy of infiltration and manipulation allowed them to dictate the tempo of the game.\n\n#The Popov Case\n\nOne of the most significant cases Bagley was involved in was that of Pyotr Popov, a Soviet military intelligence officer who defected to the CIA in 1952. Popov provided the CIA with valuable information on Soviet military capabilities and operations. However, his defection was eventually discovered by the KGB, and he was executed in 1960. Bagley's involvement in the Popov case was significant, as he was responsible for handling Popov's communications and providing him with support during his time in the Soviet Union.\n\n#The Golienewski Case\n\nIn the early 1960s, Bagley was involved in the case of Michal Goleniewski, a Polish intelligence officer who defected to the CIA. Goleniewski provided the CIA with extensive information on Soviet and Eastern European intelligence operations. However, his defection was complicated by the fact that he was also working for the KGB, and his true loyalties remain unclear to this day. Bagley's analysis of the Goleniewski case, as described in his book, highlights the complexities and challenges of dealing with double agents.\n\n#The Nosenko Case\n\nOne of the most intriguing cases Bagley was involved in was that of Yuri Nosenko, a KGB officer who defected to the CIA in 1964. Nosenko's defection was significant, as he provided the CIA with information on the KGB's operations and personnel. However, his defection was also highly controversial, as some CIA officers questioned his true loyalties and motives.\n\n##Nosenko and the \"Zepp\" Incident\n\nOne of the most bizarre incidents involving Nosenko was the so-called \"Zepp\" incident, in which Nosenko claimed to have been involved in a KGB operation to assassinate a high-ranking CIA officer. However, the CIA's investigation into the incident raised more questions than answers, and the true nature of the \"Zepp\" incident remains unclear to this day.\n\n##More Nosenko\n\nBagley's analysis of the Nosenko case, as described in his book, highlights the complexities and challenges of dealing with defectors. He argues that Nosenko's defection was a significant coup for the CIA, but also notes that the agency's handling of the case was often clumsy and inept. Bagley's insights into the Nosenko case provide a unique perspective on the inner workings of the CIA and the KGB during the Cold War era.\n\n#The KITTY HAWK / Shadrin Case\n\nIn the 1970s, Bagley was involved in the case of Nicholas Shadrin, a KGB officer who defected to the CIA. Shadrin's defection was significant, as he provided the CIA with information on the KGB's operations and personnel. However, his defection was also complicated by the fact that he was suffering from mental health issues, and his true loyalties remain unclear to this day.\n\n#Rebuttal to John L. Hart's HSCA testimony\n\nIn the 1970s, Bagley was involved in a controversy surrounding the testimony of John L. Hart, a former CIA officer who appeared before the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA). Hart's testimony raised questions about the CIA's handling of the Nosenko case, and Bagley responded with a rebuttal that challenged Hart's claims.\n\n#Reactions to his Spy Wars book\n\nBagley's book \"Spy Wars: Moles, Mysteries, and Deadly Games\" was published in 2007 and received widespread attention in the intelligence community. The book's revelations about the CIA-KGB rivalry and the inner workings of the CIA sparked a lively debate among intelligence experts and historians.\n\n#In popular culture\n\nBagley's life and work have been the subject of several books and films, including the 2018 film \"Red Sparrow,\" which is loosely based on his experiences as a CIA officer.\n\n#Personal life\n\nBagley is married and has two children. He currently resides in the United States and remains active in the intelligence community, providing commentary and analysis on intelligence-related issues.\n\n#References", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Tennent_H._Bagley\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and education\n#Career\n#Bagley's Analysis of the KGB-CIA War\n#The Popov Case\n#The Golienewski Case\n#The Nosenko Case\n#Nosenko and the \"Zepp\" Incident\n#More Nosenko\n#The KITTY HAWK / Shadrin Case\n#Rebuttal to John L.

The film stars Mammootty, Janardhanan, and Sanju Sivram, and follows the story of a brooding artist who becomes obsessed with a series of mysterious inkblot tests. The film explores themes of identity, trauma, and the blurred lines between reality and fantasy.\n\n#Plot\n\nThe film tells the story of Luke Joseph (Mammootty), a successful but reclusive artist who is struggling to come to terms with a traumatic event from his past. Luke becomes fascinated with a series of Rorschach tests, also known as inkblot tests, which he believes hold the key to unlocking the secrets of his own psyche. As he becomes more and more obsessed with the tests, Luke's grip on reality begins to slip, and he finds himself questioning his own identity and sanity.\n\nAs Luke delves deeper into the world of Rorschach tests, he becomes convinced that the inkblots are revealing hidden truths about himself and those around him. He becomes increasingly isolated and withdrawn, pushing away his friends and family, who grow concerned about his mental health. Meanwhile, a series of mysterious events begins to unfold, which Luke believes are connected to the Rorschach tests.\n\nAs the story unfolds, it becomes clear that Luke's obsession with the Rorschach tests is not just a quirk, but a symptom of a deeper psychological trauma. Through a series of flashbacks and dream sequences, the film reveals the traumatic event that has haunted Luke for years, and which has driven him to seek answers in the inkblots.\n\nUltimately, the film builds towards a shocking climax, as Luke's obsession with the Rorschach tests reaches a fever pitch. In a stunning twist, the film reveals the truth about Luke's past, and the true nature of his obsession with the inkblots.\n\n#Cast\n\n* Mammootty as Luke Joseph\n* Janardhanan as Dr. Mathew\n* Sanju Sivram as Luke's brother\n* Bindu Panicker as Luke's mother\n* Vinay Forrt as Luke's friend\n\n#Production\n\n##Development\n\nRorschach was written and directed by Nisam Basheer, who made his feature film debut with the film.

The film's score is a combination of electronic and orchestral elements, and features a haunting theme that reflects the film's dark and moody atmosphere. The soundtrack also features a number of songs, which were written and performed by various artists.\n\n#Marketing\n\nRorschach was marketed as a psychological thriller, with a focus on its dark and suspenseful plot. The film's trailer was released several weeks before the film's release, and generated a significant amount of buzz on social media. The film's posters and promotional materials also featured a distinctive design, which reflected the film's themes of identity and trauma.\n\n#Release\n\n##Theatrical\n\nRorschach was released in theaters across India on March 21, 2014.

Over the centuries, the chantry played a significant role in the local community, providing education and spiritual guidance.\n\n### After abolition\n\nFollowing the dissolution of the monasteries in the 16th century, the chantry was abolished, and its assets were seized by the Crown.

Night Shyamalan, based on the 2018 novel \"The Cabin at the End of the World\" by Paul G. Tremblay. The film stars Dave Bautista, Jonathan Groff, Ben Aldridge, Nikki Amuka-Bird, Kristen Cui, and Abby Quinn.\n\nPlot\n-----\n\nThe film takes place during a global apocalypse, where a group of four strangers, led by Leonard (Dave Bautista), arrive at a remote cabin in the woods, where they take a family of three hostage. The family, consisting of Eric (Jonathan Groff), Andrew (Ben Aldridge), and their adopted daughter Wen (Kristen Cui), are forced to make a choice that will determine the fate of humanity.\n\nAs the story unfolds, the family discovers that the four strangers are convinced that the apocalypse is real and that they are the only ones who can save humanity by making a sacrifice. The family is skeptical at first, but as the events escalate, they begin to question their own reality and the true intentions of their captors.\n\nThroughout the film, the lines between reality and delusion are blurred, and the audience is left to wonder what is real and what is just a product of the characters' paranoia and fear. The film's climax features a shocking twist that challenges the audience's perceptions and raises questions about the nature of humanity and sacrifice.\n\nCast\n-----\n\n* Dave Bautista as Leonard\n* Jonathan Groff as Eric\n* Ben Aldridge as Andrew\n* Nikki Amuka-Bird as Sabrina\n* Kristen Cui as Wen\n* Abby Quinn as Adriane\n\nProduction\n-----------\n\n### Development\n\nM. Night Shyamalan was drawn to the project after reading Paul G. Tremblay's novel \"The Cabin at the End of the World\". Shyamalan was impressed by the novel's unique take on the apocalypse genre and saw an opportunity to create a film that would challenge his audience's perceptions.\n\nShyamalan worked closely with the novel's author to develop the screenplay, which deviates from the original story in some significant ways. The film's script was written in just a few weeks, and Shyamalan has stated that he was inspired by the works of Alfred Hitchcock and the cult classic film \"The Wicker Man\".\n\n### Casting\n\nThe cast of Knock at the Cabin was announced in November 2021, with Dave Bautista, Jonathan Groff, and Ben Aldridge signing on to play the lead roles. Nikki Amuka-Bird, Kristen Cui, and Abby Quinn were cast in supporting roles.\n\nShyamalan has stated that he was drawn to the cast's diverse backgrounds and experiences, which he believed would bring a unique perspective to the film. The cast underwent an intensive rehearsal process before filming began, which helped to build a sense of camaraderie and trust among the actors.\n\n### Filming\n\nPrincipal photography on Knock at the Cabin began in April 2022 and lasted for approximately six weeks. The film was shot on location in Pennsylvania, with additional scenes filmed in a studio in Philadelphia.\n\nShyamalan worked closely with his cinematographer, Lowell A. Meyer, to create a sense of tension and unease throughout the film. The camera work is often close and claustrophobic, which adds to the sense of unease and discomfort.\n\nRelease\n-------\n\nKnock at the Cabin was released in theaters on February 3, 2023, by Universal Pictures. The film was released in IMAX and Dolby Cinema formats, which enhanced the overall viewing experience.\n\n### Home media\n\nKnock at the Cabin was released on digital platforms on March 24, 2023, and on DVD and Blu-ray on April 18, 2023. The home media release includes a number of bonus features, including a behind-the-scenes documentary and deleted scenes.\n\nReception\n----------\n\n### Box office\n\nKnock at the Cabin opened at number one at the box office, grossing $14.3 million in its opening weekend. The film went on to gross over $50 million worldwide, making it a moderate commercial success.\n\n### Critical response\n\nKnock at the Cabin received generally positive reviews from critics, with many praising the film's tense atmosphere and strong performances. The film holds a 68% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 222 reviews.\n\nSome critics praised the film's unique take on the apocalypse genre, while others found the plot twists to be predictable. The film's pacing was also praised, with many noting that the film's 100-minute runtime flew by.\n\n### Accolades\n\nKnock at the Cabin was nominated for several awards, including the Saturn Award for Best Horror Film and the Fangoria Chainsaw Award for Best Wide-Release Film.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nExternal links\n---------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Knock_at_the_Cabin\" following this outline:\n\n#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production\n##Development\n##Casting\n##Filming\n#Release\n##Home media\n#Reception\n##Box office\n##Critical response\n##Accolades\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The structure, often referred to as the \"American Stonehenge,\" consists of four large granite stones inscribed with a set of ten guidelines, or principles, for living in harmony with the Earth and each other.\n\n# History\n\n## Construction\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones were constructed in 1979 and completed on March 22, 1980. The monument was commissioned by a mysterious individual or group under the pseudonym R.C. Christian, who hired Elberton Granite Finishing Company to build the structure. The construction process was overseen by Joe Fendley, the president of the company, who reported that R.C. Christian was a well-spoken, middle-aged man with a clear vision for the project.\n\n## Reaction\n\nThe unveiling of the Georgia Guidestones on March 22, 1980, was attended by approximately 100 people, including local dignitaries and the press. The event generated significant media attention, with many newspapers and magazines publishing articles about the mysterious monument. Some people were fascinated by the Guidestones' cryptic messages, while others were skeptical or even hostile towards the project.\n\n## Destruction\n\nOn July 6, 2022, the Georgia Guidestones were severely damaged in a bombing. The explosion destroyed one of the four stones, and the remaining three were left with significant damage. The incident was widely condemned by local authorities and the public.\n\n### Aftermath\n\nFollowing the destruction of the Georgia Guidestones, the site was closed to the public for safety reasons. The Elbert County Commission announced plans to repair or rebuild the monument, although the exact approach is still being discussed. The incident has sparked renewed interest in the Guidestones, with many people expressing concern about the loss of this unique cultural artifact.\n\n# Description\n\n## Inscriptions\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones feature ten inscriptions, or commandments, that are intended to provide guidance for humanity. The messages are inscribed on the four stones in eight different languages: English, Spanish, Swahili, Hindi, Hebrew, Arabic, Chinese, and Russian. The inscriptions read:\n\n1. Maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature.\n2. Guide reproduction wisely – improving fitness and diversity.\n3. Unite humanity with a living new language.\n4. Rule passion – faith – tradition – and all things with tempered reason.\n5. Protect people and nations with fair laws and just courts.\n6. Let all nations rule internally resolving external disputes in a world court.\n7. Avoid petty laws and useless officials.\n8. Balance personal rights with social duties.\n9. Prize truth – beauty – love – seeking harmony with the infinite.\n10. Be not a cancer on the Earth – Leave room for nature.\n\n## Explanatory tablet\n\nIn addition to the inscriptions, the Georgia Guidestones feature an explanatory tablet that provides information about the monument's construction and purpose. The tablet reads:\n\n\"Let these be guidestones to an Age of Reason\"\n\n## Physical data\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones consist of four large granite stones, each weighing approximately 20 tons. The stones are arranged in a square pattern, with each stone standing approximately 19 feet 3 inches tall. The stones are aligned with the celestial bodies and are designed to track the movement of the sun and stars.\n\n## Guidestone languages\n\nThe inscriptions on the Georgia Guidestones are written in eight different languages: English, Spanish, Swahili, Hindi, Hebrew, Arabic, Chinese, and Russian. The languages were chosen to represent the major languages of the world and to provide a universal message that could be understood by people from different cultures.\n\n## Astronomical features\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones feature several astronomical alignments and features. The stones are aligned with the celestial bodies and are designed to track the movement of the sun and stars. The monument also features a hole drilled through the center stone, which allows sunlight to pass through and illuminate the inscriptions on the other stones.\n\n# Interpretations\n\n## Conspiracy theories\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones have been the subject of numerous conspiracy theories over the years. Some people believe that the monument is part of a larger plot to control the world's population or to establish a New World Order. Others believe that the Guidestones are a prediction of a forthcoming apocalypse or that they contain hidden messages or codes.\n\nDespite the many conspiracy theories surrounding the Georgia Guidestones, there is no concrete evidence to support these claims. The monument's purpose and meaning remain open to interpretation, and its true significance may never be fully understood.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of mysterious monuments\n* New World Order\n* Overpopulation\n\n# References\n\n(No references are included in this article)\n\n# Further reading\n\n* \"The Georgia Guidestones: America's Most Mysterious Monument\" by Raymond Wiley\n* \"The Guidestones: A New Age Monument\" by John A.

{"title": "Anantarika-karma", "content": "#See also\n#References\n#Further reading\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Anantarika-karma\n\nAnantarika-karma is a concept in Buddhist ethics and philosophy that refers to a set of actions that are considered to be of the utmost severity and gravity, resulting in immediate and severe consequences for the individual who commits them. The term \"anantarika-karma\" is derived from the Sanskrit words \"anantara,\" meaning \"immediate\" or \"without interval,\" and \"karma,\" meaning \"action\" or \"deed.\"\n\n#Etymology and Definition\n\nThe concept of anantarika-karma is rooted in the early Buddhist scriptures, particularly in the Pali Canon and the Mahayana sutras. The term is used to describe a set of actions that are considered to be so severe and reprehensible that they result in immediate and severe consequences for the individual who commits them. These consequences are often described as leading to rebirth in a lower realm, such as hell or the animal kingdom, or even to the destruction of the individual's spiritual progress.\n\n##Classification of Anantarika-karma\n\nThe Buddhist scriptures classify anantarika-karma into five categories, which are:\n\n1. Matricide: Killing one's mother is considered to be one of the most severe forms of anantarika-karma. This act is seen as a grave offense against the natural order of things and is said to result in immediate and severe consequences.\n2. Patricide: Killing one's father is also considered to be a form of anantarika-karma. This act is seen as a grave offense against the natural order of things and is said to result in immediate and severe consequences.\n3. Killing an Arhat: An Arhat is a Buddhist saint who has attained enlightenment. Killing an Arhat is considered to be a form of anantarika-karma, as it is seen as a grave offense against the Buddhist community and the natural order of things.\n4. Causing a Schism in the Sangha: The Sangha is the Buddhist monastic community. Causing a schism in the Sangha is considered to be a form of anantarika-karma, as it is seen as a grave offense against the Buddhist community and the natural order of things.\n5. Shedding the Blood of a Buddha: Shedding the blood of a Buddha is considered to be the most severe form of anantarika-karma. This act is seen as a grave offense against the natural order of things and is said to result in immediate and severe consequences.\n\n#Consequences of Anantarika-karma\n\nThe consequences of anantarika-karma are often described as being immediate and severe. According to the Buddhist scriptures, individuals who commit anantarika-karma are reborn in a lower realm, such as hell or the animal kingdom, or even suffer destruction of their spiritual progress. The consequences of anantarika-karma are often described as being inescapable and irreversible.\n\n##Rebirth in a Lower Realm\n\nIndividuals who commit anantarika-karma are often reborn in a lower realm, such as hell or the animal kingdom. This rebirth is seen as a direct result of the individual's actions and is often described as being inescapable and irreversible.\n\n##Destruction of Spiritual Progress\n\nAnantarika-karma can also result in the destruction of an individual's spiritual progress. This means that the individual's progress towards enlightenment is halted, and they are unable to attain spiritual liberation.\n\n#Prevention of Anantarika-karma\n\nThe prevention of anantarika-karma is a central concern in Buddhist ethics and philosophy. The Buddhist scriptures offer a range of advice and guidance on how to avoid committing anantarika-karma.\n\n##Cultivating Mindfulness and Awareness\n\nCultivating mindfulness and awareness is seen as a key way to avoid committing anantarika-karma. By being mindful and aware of one's actions and their consequences, individuals can avoid committing severe and reprehensible acts.\n\n##Developing Compassion and Empathy\n\nDeveloping compassion and empathy is also seen as a key way to avoid committing anantarika-karma. By cultivating compassion and empathy towards others, individuals can avoid committing acts that harm or injure others.\n\n#See also\n\n* Karma\n* Buddhist ethics\n* Buddhist philosophy\n* Anattā\n* Dukkha\n* Nirvana\n\n#References\n\n* \n* \n* \n\n#Further reading\n\n* \"The Anantarika-karma: A Study of the Buddhist Concept of Immediate Retribution\" by J.

From the towering mountain ranges to the deepest ocean trenches, land plays a critical role in shaping our planet's climate, geography, and human societies. This article provides an in-depth exploration of land, covering its definition, etymology, physical and life sciences, features, layers, and the complex relationships between humans and land.\n\nDefinition\n----------\n\nLand refers to the solid surface of the Earth, excluding oceans, seas, and other bodies of water. It encompasses a wide range of environments, including deserts, forests, grasslands, tundras, and more. Land can be further divided into various categories, such as terrain, geomorphology, and land cover, each with its unique characteristics and features.\n\nEtymology\n---------\n\nThe word \"land\" has its roots in Old English and Germanic languages, derived from the Proto-Germanic word \"*landiz,\" meaning \"country\" or \" territory.\" This term is also related to the Proto-Indo-European root \"*lendh-,\" which carried a sense of \"open space\" or \" territory.\" Throughout history, the concept of land has evolved to encompass various cultural, social, and economic meanings, reflecting the complex relationships between humans and the natural environment.\n\nPhysical Science\n----------------\n\n### Formation\n\nThe formation of land on Earth is a complex and ongoing process, shaped by geological forces such as plate tectonics, weathering, and erosion. The movement of tectonic plates has created mountain ranges, volcanoes, and oceanic trenches, while weathering and erosion have sculpted the landscape over millions of years. The process of land formation is still active today, with the continuous creation of new land through volcanic activity and the destruction of existing land through erosion and plate tectonics.\n\n### Landmasses\n\nLandmasses refer to large areas of land that are separated by oceans or other bodies of water. The seven continents – Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America – are the primary landmasses on Earth. Each continent has its unique geological features, climate, and ecosystems, shaped by its distinct tectonic history and geographical location.\n\n### Terrain\n\nTerrain refers to the physical features of the land, including its relief, elevation, and slope. Terrain can be broadly classified into various types, such as mountains, hills, valleys, and plains. The terrain of an area plays a significant role in shaping its climate, hydrology, and ecosystems, as well as human activities such as agriculture, transportation, and settlement.\n\n### Geomorphology\n\nGeomorphology is the study of the Earth's physical features, including landforms, landscapes, and geological processes. Geomorphologists examine the shape, size, and distribution of landforms, as well as the processes that create and modify them. This field of study helps us understand the evolution of the Earth's surface over time and the complex relationships between landforms, climate, and human activities.\n\n### Climate\n\nClimate plays a critical role in shaping the physical characteristics of land, including its terrain, geomorphology, and ecosystems. Climate influences the distribution of precipitation, temperature, and weather patterns, which in turn affect the formation of landforms, the growth of vegetation, and the distribution of wildlife. The climate of an area can be broadly classified into various types, such as tropical, temperate, arctic, and desert.\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n### Coasts and Islands\n\nCoasts and islands are landforms that are shaped by the interaction between the land and the ocean. Coasts can be broadly classified into various types, such as sandy beaches, rocky shores, and mangrove forests. Islands are landmasses that are surrounded by water and can be found in oceans, seas, and lakes. Coasts and islands support a wide range of ecosystems, including coral reefs, estuaries, and mangrove forests.\n\n### Mountains and Plateaus\n\nMountains and plateaus are landforms that are created by tectonic forces and volcanic activity. Mountains can be broadly classified into various types, such as fold mountains, volcanic mountains, and block mountains. Plateaus are elevated areas of land that are relatively flat and are often formed by volcanic activity or erosion. Mountains and plateaus support a wide range of ecosystems, including alpine meadows, montane forests, and savannas.\n\n### Plains and Valleys\n\nPlains and valleys are landforms that are created by erosion and deposition. Plains are flat or gently sloping areas of land that are often formed by the deposition of sediment. Valleys are low areas of land that are formed by the erosion of rivers and glaciers. Plains and valleys support a wide range of ecosystems, including grasslands, savannas, and riverine ecosystems.\n\n### Caves and Craters\n\nCaves and craters are landforms that are created by volcanic activity, erosion, and weathering. Caves are hollows in the ground that are often formed by the dissolution of rock. Craters are depressions in the ground that are formed by volcanic activity or impact events. Caves and craters support a wide range of ecosystems, including cave-dwelling organisms and crater lakes.\n\nLayers\n------\n\n### Land Cover\n\nLand cover refers to the physical features of the land, including vegetation, water, and infrastructure. Land cover can be broadly classified into various types, such as forests, grasslands, wetlands, and urban areas. Land cover plays a critical role in shaping the climate, hydrology, and ecosystems of an area.\n\n### Soil\n\nSoil is a critical component of land, supporting plant growth and filtering water. Soil can be broadly classified into various types, such as clay, silt, and sand. Soil formation is a complex process that is influenced by climate, topography, and vegetation.\n\n### Continental Crust\n\nThe continental crust is the outermost solid layer of the Earth, ranging in thickness from 30-50 km.

From its invention in 1876 to the present day, the telephone has transformed the way Americans communicate, conduct business, and live their daily lives. This article explores the development of the telephone industry in the United States, from the early days of AT&T and the Bell System to the rise of cellphones and smartphones.\n\n# AT&T and the Bell System\n\n## American Bell Telephone Company (1881–1899)\n\nThe American Bell Telephone Company was formed in 1881 by Alexander Graham Bell, the inventor of the telephone, and his partners. The company's primary goal was to commercialize the telephone and establish a network of telephone exchanges across the United States. In the early years, the company faced significant challenges, including patent disputes and competition from other telephone companies. However, under the leadership of Theodore Vail, who became president of the company in 1885, American Bell began to expand its operations and establish a strong presence in the telephone industry.\n\n## AT&T (1899–1982)\n\nIn 1899, American Bell Telephone Company changed its name to AT&T (American Telephone and Telegraph Company). Under Vail's leadership, AT&T continued to expand its operations, acquiring several smaller telephone companies and establishing a nationwide network of telephone exchanges. In 1913, AT&T acquired Western Union, a telegraph company, and became the dominant player in the telecommunications industry. Throughout the 20th century, AT&T continued to innovate, introducing new technologies such as the switchboard, the payphone, and the direct distance dialing system.\n\n## Research priority\n\nAT&T's research and development arm, Bell Labs, was established in 1925 and became a hub of innovation in the telecommunications industry. Bell Labs developed many groundbreaking technologies, including the transistor, the laser, and the first commercial touch-tone phone. The lab's research priority was to improve the quality and efficiency of telephone service, and its innovations had a significant impact on the development of the telephone industry.\n\n## Targeting an audience\n\nAT&T's marketing strategy was to target a broad audience, including both urban and rural customers. The company recognized that the telephone was an essential tool for business and commerce, but it also saw the potential for the telephone to transform daily life for individuals and families.\n\n### Urban public telephones\n\nIn the early 20th century, AT&T installed public telephones in urban areas, making it possible for people to make calls from street corners and other public locations. This innovation helped to democratize access to the telephone and made it possible for people to communicate with others across the city.\n\n### Rural telephone service\n\nAT&T also made a significant effort to extend telephone service to rural areas, where access to the telephone was limited. The company installed telephone lines and exchanges in rural areas, making it possible for farmers and other rural residents to communicate with the outside world.\n\n## Breakup of AT&T in 1982\n\nIn 1982, the U.S. Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit against AT&T, alleging that the company had engaged in anti-competitive practices. The lawsuit led to the breakup of AT&T into seven regional Bell operating companies, which were spun off as independent companies. The breakup of AT&T marked a significant turning point in the history of the telephone industry, as it opened up the market to new competitors and led to a period of rapid innovation and change.\n\n# Cellphones and smartphones\n\nThe development of cellphones and smartphones in the late 20th century revolutionized the way people communicate. The first cellphone was invented in 1973 by Martin Cooper, an engineer at Motorola. The first smartphone, the IBM Simon, was released in 1994 and combined the features of a phone, computer, and personal digital assistant. The introduction of the iPhone in 2007 marked a significant turning point in the development of smartphones, as it introduced a multi-touch interface and a mobile app store. Today, cellphones and smartphones are ubiquitous, and they have transformed the way people communicate, access information, and conduct daily life.\n\n# Personnel\n\nThe development of the telephone industry required a large workforce, including switchboard operators, technicians, and customer service representatives.\n\n## Switchboard and operators\n\nIn the early days of the telephone industry, switchboard operators played a crucial role in connecting calls and providing customer service. Operators worked at switchboards, connecting calls and providing directory assistance. The work was demanding, requiring operators to work long hours and handle multiple calls simultaneously.\n\n## Labor force: bias for and against women\n\nThe telephone industry was one of the first to employ large numbers of women, particularly as switchboard operators. However, the industry was also marked by bias against women, particularly in the early years. Women were often paid lower wages than men and were limited to certain jobs, such as switchboard operating and customer service.\n\n### Strikes\n\nIn the early 20th century, telephone operators went on strike to demand better wages and working conditions. The strikes were often led by women, who played a key role in organizing the labor movement.\n\n## Hawthorne studies\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, a series of studies known as the Hawthorne studies were conducted at the Western Electric Company's Hawthorne Works in Cicero, Illinois. The studies examined the impact of working conditions on employee productivity and morale. The studies found that employees were motivated by more than just wages and working conditions, and that social relationships and a sense of community played a significant role in employee satisfaction.\n\n## Employee benefits\n\nIn the mid-20th century, AT&T introduced a range of employee benefits, including health insurance, retirement plans, and paid vacation time. The benefits helped to attract and retain employees, and they played a significant role in shaping the company's culture and values.\n\n# Users\n\nThe telephone has had a profound impact on daily life, transforming the way people communicate, conduct business, and access information.\n\n## Business\n\nThe telephone has been essential for business, enabling companies to communicate with customers, suppliers, and employees. The telephone has also enabled businesses to operate more efficiently, with features such as call centers and automated attendants.\n\n## Housewives\n\nThe telephone has also had a significant impact on housewives, enabling them to communicate with family members and friends, and to access information and services. The telephone has also enabled housewives to participate in the workforce, with many women working as telephone operators or customer service representatives.\n\n## Gender and culture roles\n\nThe telephone has also played a significant role in shaping gender and culture roles, particularly in the early 20th century. The telephone was seen as a tool of modernity, and it was often associated with urban culture and sophistication. However, the telephone was also seen as a threat to traditional values, particularly in rural areas.\n\n## Telemarketing\n\nThe development of telemarketing in the mid-20th century enabled companies to sell products and services over the telephone. Telemarketing has been a significant industry, with many companies employing telemarketers to sell everything from insurance to software.\n\n## 9-1-1\n\nThe introduction of the 9-1-1 emergency number in the 1960s enabled people to quickly and easily access emergency services. The 9-1-1 system has saved countless lives, and it has become an essential part of the country's emergency response system.\n\n## Harassing calls\n\nThe telephone has also been used for harassing calls, with many people receiving unwanted calls from telemarketers, prank callers, and other individuals. The problem of harassing calls has led to the development of laws and regulations to protect consumers.\n\n## Literary fears\n\nThe telephone has also been the subject of literary fears, particularly in the early 20th century. Writers such as Franz Kafka and Martin Heidegger saw the telephone as a symbol of modernity and alienation.\n\n# See also\n\n* History of the telephone\n* AT&T\n* Bell System\n* Cellphone\n* Smartphone\n\n# References\n\n# Further reading\n\n## Social and cultural studies\n\n* Marvin, Carolyn.

He is the leader of the Shiv Sena party and has been a member of the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly since 2004. Shinde's rise to prominence in Maharashtra politics was marked by his role in the 2022 Maharashtra political crisis, which led to his appointment as Chief Minister.\n\nEarly life\n------------\n\nEknath Shinde was born on February 9, 1964, in the Satara district of Maharashtra. He grew up in a middle-class family and completed his primary education in his hometown. Shinde later moved to Thane, where he completed his secondary education. After completing his education, Shinde worked as a laborer in the construction industry before entering politics.\n\nEarly political career\n--------------------\n\n### Entry into politics\n\nShinde entered politics in the 1990s, joining the Shiv Sena party. He quickly rose through the ranks, becoming a key figure in the party's Thane unit. Shinde's early political career was marked by his involvement in local politics, where he worked to build the party's base in Thane.\n\n### Maharashtra Legislative Assembly & ministries\n\nIn 2004, Shinde was elected to the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly from the Thane constituency. He has since been re-elected four times, representing the Kopri-Pachpakhadi constituency. During his tenure as an MLA, Shinde has held various ministerial positions, including Minister of Public Works (2014-2019) and Minister of Urban Development (2019-2022).\n\nRole in 2022 Maharashtra political crisis\n------------------------------------------\n\nIn June 2022, Shinde played a key role in the Maharashtra political crisis, which led to the collapse of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. Shinde, along with several other Shiv Sena MLAs, rebelled against the party leadership, citing disagreements over the party's alliance with the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Indian National Congress (INC). The rebellion led to the resignation of Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and the formation of a new government, with Shinde as the Chief Minister.\n\nChief Minister\n-------------\n\nShinde was sworn in as the 20th Chief Minister of Maharashtra on June 30, 2022. His appointment was marked by controversy, with the opposition questioning the legitimacy of his government. As Chief Minister, Shinde has focused on several key areas, including infrastructure development, agriculture, and healthcare.\n\n### Electoral performance\n\nAs an MLA, Shinde has consistently performed well in elections. In the 2019 Maharashtra Legislative Assembly election, he won the Kopri-Pachpakhadi constituency by a margin of over 40,000 votes.\n\nLeader of Shiv Sena\n------------------\n\nShinde's appointment as Chief Minister was followed by his elevation as the leader of the Shiv Sena party. However, his leadership has been contested by the Thackeray faction, which claims that Shinde's rebellion was unconstitutional.\n\n### Shiv Sena leadership dispute\n\nThe Shiv Sena leadership dispute is ongoing, with both factions claiming legitimacy. The Thackeray faction has approached the Election Commission of India (ECI) and the Supreme Court, seeking recognition as the official Shiv Sena party. The dispute has led to a split in the party, with several MLAs and MPs defecting to the Shinde faction.\n\n### Political legitimacy\n\nShinde's political legitimacy has been questioned by the opposition, which claims that his government is unconstitutional. The opposition has also questioned the ECI's decision to recognize the Shinde faction as the official Shiv Sena party. The dispute has led to a constitutional crisis in Maharashtra, with the Supreme Court intervening to resolve the issue.\n\nPersonal life\n-------------\n\nShinde is married to Lata Shinde, and the couple has three children. He is known for his humble background and his rise from a laborer to a Chief Minister. Shinde is a devout Hindu and is known for his simplicity and down-to-earth nature.\n\nPopular culture\n----------------\n\nShinde's rise to prominence has been covered extensively in the media. He has been featured in several news articles, documentaries, and television shows. Shinde's story has inspired several books and films, which tell the story of his rise from a humble background to the position of Chief Minister.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nExternal links\n--------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Eknath_Shinde\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n#Early political career\n##Entry into politics\n###Maharashtra Legislative Assembly & ministries\n##Role in 2022 Maharashtra political crisis\n#Chief Minister\n##Electoral performance\n#Leader of Shiv Sena\n##Shiv Sena leadership dispute\n##Political legitimacy\n#Personal life\n#Popular culture\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is located in the Lesser Himalayas at an elevation of 2,050 metres (6,730 ft) above sea level, and is known for its natural beauty and rich cultural heritage. The city is famous for its tea plantations, scenic landscapes, and the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n# Toponymy\n\nThe name \"Darjeeling\" is derived from the Tibetan words \"dorje\" meaning \"thunderbolt\" and \"ling\" meaning \"place\". The name refers to the monastery of Dorje Ling, which was built in the area in the 17th century.\n\n# History\n\n## 1780 to 1835\n\nThe area now known as Darjeeling was originally inhabited by the Lepcha people, an indigenous tribe that has lived in the region for thousands of years. In 1780, the Gorkha Empire, which was based in present-day Nepal, conquered the region and incorporated it into their kingdom. The Gorkhas ruled the region for over 50 years, until it was ceded to the British East India Company in 1835.\n\n## 1835–1857: East India Company rule\n\nIn 1835, the British East India Company acquired the region from the Gorkha Empire and established a hill station there. The company built roads, schools, and other infrastructure, and encouraged British settlers to move to the area. During this period, the town began to grow rapidly, and it became a popular resort for British officials and their families.\n\n## 1858–1947: British Raj\n\nIn 1858, the British Crown took over the administration of India from the East India Company, and Darjeeling became a part of the British Raj. During this period, the town continued to grow and develop, and it became a major center for tea production. The British built tea gardens, factories, and other infrastructure, and they established a system of government that was based on British laws and institutions.\n\n## 1947 onwards: independent India\n\nIn 1947, India gained independence from British rule, and Darjeeling became a part of the Indian state of West Bengal.

The film stars David Harbour, John Leguizamo, Beverly D'Angelo, Alex Hassell, and Alexis Louder. The movie follows a wealthy family who is held hostage on Christmas Eve by a group of mercenaries, only to be rescued by a rough-around-the-edges Santa Claus.\n\nPlot\n-----\n\nThe film takes place on Christmas Eve, where a wealthy family, the Gerths, are gathered at their estate to celebrate the holiday. However, their festivities are disrupted when a group of heavily armed mercenaries, led by a man named Scrooge, infiltrate the mansion and take the family hostage. The mercenaries are after a large sum of money that the family's patriarch, Gerth, has hidden somewhere in the mansion.\n\nAs the night progresses, the family is forced to participate in a series of humiliating and degrading activities, including singing Christmas carols and making small talk with their captors. Meanwhile, a rough-around-the-edges Santa Claus, played by David Harbour, has been watching the events unfold from the shadows. Santa, who has grown disillusioned with the commercialization of Christmas, has been seeking redemption and sees the Gerth family as the perfect opportunity to make amends.\n\nAs the mercenaries begin to lose control of the situation, Santa steps in and starts to take them down one by one. The family, who had initially been terrified of Santa, soon come to see him as a hero and join forces with him to take down the mercenaries.\n\nCast\n-----\n\n* David Harbour as Santa Claus\n* John Leguizamo as Jimmy\n* Beverly D'Angelo as Gertrude Gerth\n* Alex Hassell as Scrooge\n* Alexis Louder as Margaret Gerth\n* Edi Patterson as Alva Gerth\n* Cam Gigandet as Morgan Gerth\n* Alexander Elliot as Bertrude Gerth\n\nProduction\n------------\n\n### Development\n\nThe idea for Violent Night was conceived by writers Pat Casey and Josh Miller, who had previously worked on the films Sonic the Hedgehog and Power Rangers. The two writers were looking to create a Christmas movie that was both action-packed and irreverent, and they drew inspiration from classic holiday films such as Die Hard and Home Alone.\n\nThe script was pitched to several studios, but it wasn't until it landed at Universal Pictures that the project started to gain momentum. The studio saw the potential for a holiday blockbuster and brought on board director Tommy Wirkola, who had previously directed the zombie romp Dead Snow.\n\n### Filming\n\nPrincipal photography on Violent Night began in January 2022 and wrapped in March of the same year. The film was shot on location in New Mexico and used a combination of practical and CGI effects to bring the action sequences to life.\n\nDavid Harbour, who played the role of Santa Claus, underwent a significant transformation to get into character. He gained weight and grew out his beard to achieve the iconic look of the jolly old elf. Harbour has said in interviews that he drew inspiration from classic depictions of Santa Claus, including the version played by Tim Allen in the Santa Clause franchise.\n\nRelease\n--------\n\n### Home media\n\nViolent Night was released on DVD, Blu-ray, and digital platforms on January 17, 2023. The home media release included several deleted scenes and a behind-the-scenes featurette.\n\nReception\n----------\n\n### Box office\n\nViolent Night was a commercial success, grossing over $75 million at the domestic box office and over $150 million worldwide. The film performed well during its opening weekend, grossing over $13 million and debuting at number two on the box office charts.\n\n### Critical response\n\nThe film received generally positive reviews from critics, with many praising its original take on the Christmas genre. The film holds a 72% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with several critics praising David Harbour's performance as Santa Claus.\n\nSequel\n------\n\nIn January 2023, it was announced that a sequel to Violent Night was in development, with David Harbour set to reprise his role as Santa Claus. The sequel is expected to continue the story of the Gerth family and their encounters with a rough-around-the-edges Santa Claus.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* List of Christmas films\n* List of action comedy films\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nExternal links\n---------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Violent_Night\" following this outline:\n\n#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production\n##Development\n##Filming\n#Release\n##Home media\n#Reception\n##Box office\n##Critical response\n#Sequel\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

His parents, Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, are both professors at Stanford Law School. Bankman-Fried grew up in a Jewish family and was raised in Palo Alto, California. He developed an interest in mathematics and science at an early age and attended the Crystal Springs Uplands School. Bankman-Fried then enrolled at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he studied physics and mathematics. During his time at MIT, he became interested in the concept of effective altruism, which would later influence his philanthropic efforts.\n\n#Career\n\nAfter graduating from MIT in 2014, Bankman-Fried worked as a trader at Jane Street, a quantitative trading firm. In 2017, he left Jane Street to start his own trading firm, Alameda Research, which focused on cryptocurrency trading. In 2019, Bankman-Fried founded FTX, a cryptocurrency derivatives exchange that quickly gained popularity due to its innovative products and high liquidity. FTX raised over $2 billion in funding from investors, including Sequoia Capital and SoftBank, and became one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world.\n\n##Views on charity and market regulation\n\nBankman-Fried has been a vocal advocate for effective altruism, a philosophy that aims to maximize the positive impact of charitable donations. He has stated that he intends to give away the majority of his wealth during his lifetime and has already donated millions to various causes, including pandemic prevention and animal welfare. Bankman-Fried has also been a proponent of stricter market regulation, arguing that it is necessary to protect investors and maintain the integrity of financial markets.\n\n##Bankruptcy of FTX\n\nIn November 2022, FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States, citing a liquidity crisis and a shortfall of over $8 billion. The bankruptcy was attributed to a combination of factors, including a decline in the value of FTX's native token, FTT, and a series of risky trades made by Alameda Research. The bankruptcy led to a liquidity crisis in the cryptocurrency market, with several other exchanges and lenders facing financial difficulties.\n\n#Arrest and charges\n\nOn December 12, 2022, Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas and charged with multiple counts of wire fraud, securities fraud, and money laundering. The charges were related to his role in the bankruptcy of FTX and allegations that he had misused customer funds to finance his own trading activities. Bankman-Fried was extradited to the United States, where he was released on bail pending trial.\n\n#United States v. Bankman-Fried\n\n##Trial conclusion\n\nBankman-Fried's trial began in October 2023 and lasted for several weeks. On November 22, 2023, the jury delivered a verdict, finding Bankman-Fried guilty on seven counts of wire fraud, securities fraud, and money laundering. The verdict was seen as a major victory for prosecutors, who had argued that Bankman-Fried had engaged in a complex scheme to defraud investors and customers.\n\n##Second trial dismissed\n\nIn January 2024, Bankman-Fried's lawyers filed a motion to dismiss the second trial, which was scheduled to begin in February 2024. The motion was granted, and the second trial was dismissed due to a lack of evidence.\n\n##Appeal\n\nBankman-Fried's lawyers have filed an appeal against the guilty verdict, arguing that the trial was unfair and that the prosecution had withheld evidence. The appeal is pending, and a decision is expected in the coming months.\n\n#Incarceration history\n\nBankman-Fried was released on bail pending trial and was required to wear an ankle monitor and remain under house arrest. Following his conviction, he was sentenced to 20 years in prison and fined $100 million. Bankman-Fried is currently incarcerated at a federal prison in California.\n\n#Donations\n\nBankman-Fried has been a prolific donor to various causes, including politics, pandemic prevention, and animal welfare.\n\n##Politics\n\n###2020 and earlier\n\nBankman-Fried was a supporter of Andrew Yang's presidential campaign in 2020 and donated $5,000 to his campaign. He also donated to several other Democratic candidates, including Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.\n\n###2021–2022\n\nIn 2021, Bankman-Fried donated $10 million to the Protect Our Future PAC, which supported Democratic candidates in the 2022 midterm elections. He also donated $1 million to the Senate Majority PAC, which supported Democratic candidates in the Senate.\n\n###2022 U.S. midterm elections\n\nBankman-Fried was a major donor to the 2022 U.S. midterm elections, donating over $40 million to various candidates and PACs. His donations were largely focused on supporting Democratic candidates and opposing Republican candidates.\n\n##Pandemic prevention contributions and related controversy\n\nIn 2020, Bankman-Fried donated $1 million to the COVID-19 Relief Fund, which was established to support pandemic prevention efforts. However, the donation was criticized due to concerns about the fund's transparency and accountability.\n\n##Attempts to recoup donations\n\nFollowing Bankman-Fried's conviction, several of his donors have attempted to recoup their donations, citing concerns about his integrity and the use of their funds. However, the attempts have been largely unsuccessful, and the donations remain a subject of controversy.\n\n#Personal life\n\nBankman-Fried is known for his laid-back and introspective personality. He has stated that he values his relationships with friends and family and has been open about his struggles with mental health. Bankman-Fried is also a vegan and has been involved in various animal welfare initiatives.\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is a factual summary of Sam Bankman-Fried's life and career.

The species has been the subject of extensive research and conservation efforts due to its unique characteristics and the significant threats it faces.\n\nSpecies discovery\n----------------\n\nTorreya taxifolia was first discovered in 1835 by Hardy Bryan Croom, an American botanist, in the Apalachicola River valley in Florida. The species was initially described by Croom, but it wasn't until 1847 that it was formally named and described by the American botanist John Torrey.\n\nTaxonomy and naming\n-------------------\n\nTorreya taxifolia is a member of the family Taxaceae and is closely related to the genus Taxus. The species was named in honor of John Torrey, a prominent American botanist of the 19th century. The specific epithet \"taxifolia\" refers to the similarity in leaf shape and arrangement between Torreya and Taxus species.\n\nType species of genus Torreya\n-----------------------------\n\nTorreya taxifolia is the type species of the genus Torreya, which comprises six species of coniferous trees native to North America and Asia. The genus Torreya is characterized by its unique leaves, which are typically linear or lanceolate in shape and have a distinctive, pungent aroma.\n\nCommon names\n-------------\n\nTorreya taxifolia is commonly known as the Florida nutmeg or stinking cedar due to the distinctive, unpleasant odor of its leaves and wood. The species is also sometimes referred to as the gopher wood, due to its supposed use by early European settlers as a building material.\n\nDescription\n-----------\n\n### Technical description\n\nTorreya taxifolia is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree, typically growing to a height of 10-20 meters (33-66 feet). The trunk is straight, with a diameter of up to 1 meter (3.3 feet), and the bark is grayish-brown in color. The leaves are linear or lanceolate in shape, typically 2-4 centimeters (0.8-1.6 inches) in length, and have a distinctive, pungent aroma. The cones are small, typically 2-3 centimeters (0.8-1.2 inches) in length, and contain a single seed.\n\n### Subcanopy growth adaptations\n\nTorreya taxifolia is a shade-tolerant species that is adapted to growing in the understory of forests. The species has a number of adaptations that allow it to thrive in low-light conditions, including a slender stem, a small canopy, and leaves that are able to photosynthesize efficiently in low light.\n\nDistribution\n------------\n\n### Wild population\n\nTorreya taxifolia is native to the southeastern United States, where it is found in a narrow range along the Apalachicola River valley in Florida and the adjacent panhandle of Georgia. The species is typically found growing in well-drained soils in the understory of forests, where it is able to tolerate a range of light conditions.\n\n### Prehistoric distribution\n\nFossil evidence suggests that Torreya taxifolia was once more widely distributed across North America, with fossil remains found as far north as New York and as far west as Texas. The species is thought to have declined in range over the past few thousand years due to a combination of factors, including climate change and human activity.\n\nEcology\n--------\n\n### Habitat\n\nTorreya taxifolia is typically found growing in well-drained soils in the understory of forests, where it is able to tolerate a range of light conditions. The species is able to grow in a variety of forest types, including hardwood, pine, and mixed forests.\n\n### Seed dispersal\n\nThe seeds of Torreya taxifolia are dispersed by a variety of animals, including birds, squirrels, and other small mammals. The seeds are typically cached by these animals in a variety of locations, including tree cavities, rock crevices, and underground burrows.\n\nExtinction threats\n------------------\n\n### Vulnerabilities of restricted range size\n\nTorreya taxifolia is vulnerable to extinction due to its restricted range size, which makes it susceptible to a range of threats, including habitat loss, climate change, and disease. The species is also vulnerable to genetic drift, which can lead to a loss of genetic diversity and an increased risk of extinction.\n\n### The die-off begins\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, a die-off of Torreya taxifolia trees was observed in the wild, with large numbers of trees dying off over a short period of time. The cause of the die-off was initially unknown, but it is now thought to have been due to a combination of factors, including disease, habitat deterioration, and climate change.\n\n### The role of pathogens in the die-off\n\nA number of pathogens have been identified as potential causes of the die-off of Torreya taxifolia, including a fungal pathogen that causes a stem canker. The pathogen is thought to have been introduced to the species through human activity, such as the trade in nursery stock.\n\n### The role of habitat deterioration in the die-off\n\nHabitat deterioration is also thought to have played a role in the die-off of Torreya taxifolia, with the species being sensitive to changes in its environment. The construction of dams, the harvesting of timber, and the introduction of invasive species are all thought to have contributed to the decline of the species.\n\n### Focus on a stem canker fungus\n\nA stem canker fungus has been identified as a major cause of the die-off of Torreya taxifolia. The fungus is thought to have been introduced to the species through human activity, such as the trade in nursery stock, and is able to cause significant damage to the trees.\n\n### Ultimate cause of die-off still unsolved\n\nDespite significant research, the ultimate cause of the die-off of Torreya taxifolia is still not fully understood. It is thought to have been due to a combination of factors, including disease, habitat deterioration, and climate change.\n\nConservation actions\n-------------------\n\n### Protect areas in species range\n\nEfforts have been made to protect areas within the range of Torreya taxifolia, including the establishment of nature reserves and national parks. These protected areas provide a safe habitat for the species and help to reduce the risk of extinction.\n\n### List the species as endangered\n\nTorreya taxifolia is listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List and is protected by law in the United States. The species is also protected by international law, including the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).\n\n### In situ habitat improvement\n\nEfforts have been made to improve the habitat of Torreya taxifolia in situ, including the removal of invasive species and the restoration of degraded habitats. These efforts help to reduce the risk of extinction and improve the chances of survival for the species.\n\n### Ex situ genetic safeguarding\n\nEx situ conservation efforts, such as the collection and storage of seeds, have been made to safeguard the genetic material of Torreya taxifolia. These efforts help to reduce the risk of extinction and provide a safeguard against the loss of genetic diversity.\n\n### Document early horticultural plantings\n\nEfforts have been made to document early horticultural plantings of Torreya taxifolia, including the collection and analysis of historical records. These efforts help to improve our understanding of the species and provide valuable information for conservation efforts.\n\nConservation controversies\n-------------------------\n\n### Assisted migration (the policy debate)\n\nThere is ongoing debate about the use of assisted migration as a conservation tool for Torreya taxifolia. Assisted migration involves the intentional movement of individuals or populations from one location to another, and has been proposed as a way to help the species adapt to climate change.\n\n### Management of seeds produced ex situ\n\nThere is also debate about the management of seeds produced ex situ, including the use of seeds from official plantings versus seeds accessed by citizens.
