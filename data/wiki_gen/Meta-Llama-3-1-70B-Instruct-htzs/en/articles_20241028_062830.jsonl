This enigmatic square of letters has been found in various forms and locations, from ancient Roman ruins to medieval manuscripts, and has been interpreted in multiple ways, ranging from a simple word puzzle to a profound Christian symbol.\n\n# Description and naming\n\nThe Sator Square is a 5x5 grid of letters, typically arranged in a square shape, with the following configuration:\n\nS A T O R\nA R E P O\nT E N E T\nO P E R A\nR O T A S\n\nThe name \"Sator Square\" is derived from the first word in the top row, \"Sator,\" which is Latin for \"sower\" or \"farmer.\" The square is also sometimes referred to as the \"Rotas Square\" or \"Arepo Square,\" due to the presence of these words within the grid.\n\n# Discovery and dating\n\nThe Sator Square has been found in various locations, including ancient Roman ruins, medieval manuscripts, and even modern-day graffiti. The earliest known examples of the Sator Square date back to the 1st century AD, during the Roman Empire. However, the majority of surviving examples are from the medieval period, particularly from the 12th to 15th centuries.\n\n# Translation\n\nThe Sator Square is a complex word puzzle that has been interpreted in multiple ways. The grid contains several individual words, which can be read horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\n\n## Individual words\n\nThe Sator Square contains several individual words, including:\n\n* Sator (Latin for \"sower\" or \"farmer\")\n* Arepo (a proper noun, possibly a reference to a person or place)\n* Tenet (Latin for \"he holds\")\n* Opera (Latin for \"work\")\n* Rotas (Latin for \"wheels\")\n\n## Sentence construction\n\nOne way to interpret the Sator Square is to read the individual words as a sentence. When read horizontally, the top row forms the sentence \"Sator Arepo Tenet Opera Rotas,\" which roughly translates to \"The sower Arepo holds the work of the wheels.\" However, this sentence is grammatically incorrect and does not form a coherent meaning.\n\n## Arepo interpretations\n\nThe word \"Arepo\" is a subject of much speculation, with various interpretations ranging from a proper noun to a mystical term. Some scholars believe that \"Arepo\" is a reference to a person or place, while others see it as a mystical term with spiritual significance.\n\n## Further anagrams\n\nThe Sator Square contains several further anagrams and wordplay, including the presence of the words \"Tenet\" and \"Opera\" in the grid. Some scholars have also noted the presence of the phrase \"Sator Rotas\" in the grid, which forms a palindrome when read horizontally.\n\n# Origin and meaning\n\nThe origin and meaning of the Sator Square are still debated among scholars, with various theories ranging from a simple word puzzle to a profound Christian symbol.\n\n## Christian symbol\n\nOne of the most widely accepted theories is that the Sator Square is a Christian symbol, possibly created by early Christians as a form of cryptic communication.\n\n### Adoption by Christians\n\nSome scholars believe that the Sator Square was adopted by early Christians as a symbol of their faith, possibly due to the presence of the word \"Tenet\" (Latin for \"he holds\") in the grid. This word is seen as a reference to the Christian doctrine of the Trinity, with the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit holding together in unity.\n\n### Paternoster theory\n\nAnother theory is that the Sator Square is a representation of the Lord's Prayer, with the individual words forming a cryptic version of the Paternoster. This theory is based on the presence of the words \"Sator\" (possibly a reference to God the Father), \"Arepo\" (possibly a reference to the Holy Spirit), and \"Tenet\" (possibly a reference to the Son).\n\n## Roman word puzzle\n\nAnother theory is that the Sator Square is simply a Roman word puzzle, created for entertainment purposes. This theory is based on the presence of similar word puzzles in ancient Roman literature and the lack of any clear Christian symbolism in the grid.\n\n## Jewish symbol\n\nSome scholars have also suggested that the Sator Square is a Jewish symbol, possibly created by Jewish mystics as a form of cryptic communication. This theory is based on the presence of the word \"Tenet\" in the grid, which is seen as a reference to the Jewish concept of the Tetragrammaton.\n\n## Other theories\n\nThere are several other theories about the origin and meaning of the Sator Square, including the possibility that it is a form of ancient cryptography or a representation of the human soul.\n\n# Magical and medical associations\n\nThe Sator Square has been associated with various forms of magic and medicine, particularly in the medieval period.\n\nSome scholars believe that the Sator Square was used as a form of magical protection, possibly due to the presence of the word \"Tenet\" in the grid. This word is seen as a reference to the Christian doctrine of the Trinity, which was believed to offer protection against evil spirits.\n\nThe Sator Square has also been associated with various forms of medicine, particularly in the medieval period. Some scholars believe that the grid was used as a form of diagnosis, with the individual words forming a cryptic representation of the patient's symptoms.\n\n# Notable examples\n\nThere are several notable examples of the Sator Square, ranging from ancient Roman ruins to medieval manuscripts.\n\n## Roman\n\nOne of the earliest known examples of the Sator Square is from the ancient Roman city of Pompeii, which was destroyed in the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD. The grid is inscribed on a wall in the city, possibly as a form of graffiti.\n\n## Early medieval\n\nAnother notable example of the Sator Square is from the early medieval period, specifically from the 8th-century manuscript known as the \"Codex Sangallensis\". This manuscript contains a copy of the grid, possibly created by a medieval scribe as a form of cryptic communication.\n\n## Later medieval\n\nThere are several notable examples of the Sator Square from the later medieval period, particularly from the 12th to 15th centuries. One of the most famous examples is from the 13th-century manuscript known as the \"Trinity Apocalypse\", which contains a copy of the grid accompanied by a cryptic commentary.\n\n## Other\n\nThere are several other notable examples of the Sator Square, ranging from modern-day graffiti to digital art. One of the most famous examples is from the 2004 film \"The Da Vinci Code\", which features a cryptic representation of the grid as a form of puzzle.\n\n# In popular culture\n\nThe Sator Square has appeared in various forms of popular culture, ranging from literature to film.\n\nOne of the most famous examples is from the 2004 novel \"The Da Vinci Code\" by Dan Brown, which features a cryptic representation of the grid as a form of puzzle. The novel was later adapted into a film, which also featured the grid as a central plot point.\n\nThe Sator Square has also appeared in various forms of digital art and music, particularly in the 1990s and 2000s. One of the most famous examples is from the 1995 video game \"Myst\", which features a cryptic representation of the grid as a form of puzzle.\n\n# See also\n\n* Word puzzle\n* Cryptogram\n* Anagram\n* Palindrome\n* Christian symbolism\n* Medieval manuscript\n\n# Notes\n\n* The Sator Square is a complex word puzzle that has been interpreted in multiple ways.\n* The grid contains several individual words, which can be read horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\n* The Sator Square has been associated with various forms of magic and medicine, particularly in the medieval period.\n* There are several notable examples of the Sator Square, ranging from ancient Roman ruins to medieval manuscripts.\n\n# References\n\n* None\n\n# Further reading\n\n* None\n\n# External links\n\n* None", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Sator_Square\" following this outline:\n\n#Description and naming\n#Discovery and dating\n#Translation\n##Individual words\n##Sentence construction\n##Arepo interpretations\n##Further anagrams\n#Origin and meaning\n##Christian symbol\n###Adoption by Christians\n###Paternoster theory\n##Roman word puzzle\n##Jewish symbol\n##Other theories\n#Magical and medical associations\n#Notable examples\n##Roman\n##Early medieval\n##Later medieval\n##Other\n#In popular culture\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The league is one of the oldest and most respected in regional Victoria, with a rich history dating back to the late 19th century.\n\n#History\n\n##Beginnings of the O&MFA\n\nThe Ovens & Murray Football Association (O&MFA) was formed in 1893, with five foundation clubs: Beechworth, Benalla, Rutherglen, Wangaratta, and Yarrawonga. The first game was played on May 20, 1893, between Wangaratta and Benalla. The league quickly gained popularity, with new clubs joining over the years.\n\n##Post-World War II\n\nFollowing World War II, the O&MFA experienced significant growth, with the addition of new clubs and the introduction of a reserve grade competition. The 1950s saw the emergence of powerhouse clubs such as Wangaratta and Albury, who dominated the competition for many years.\n\n##1970s and 1980s\n\nThe 1970s and 1980s were marked by significant changes to the league, including the introduction of a third grade competition and the amalgamation of several clubs. The Wodonga Football Club, which had previously played in the Tallangatta & District Football League, joined the O&MFA in 1976.\n\n##1990 \"Bloodbath\" Grand Final\n\nThe 1990 grand final between Albury and Lavington is remembered for its intense physicality, earning the nickname \"Bloodbath.\" The game was marred by numerous fights and injuries, with several players ejected from the field.\n\n##Recent years\n\nIn recent years, the O&MFNL has continued to thrive, with the introduction of a netball competition in 1996 and the establishment of a representative team to compete against other regional leagues. The league has also invested in junior development programs, including the Albury Wodonga Junior Football League and the Wangaratta & District Junior Football League.\n\n#Clubs\n\n##Current clubs\n\nThe O&MFNL currently consists of 10 clubs:\n\n* Albury Football Club\n* Corowa-Rutherglen Football Club\n* Lavington Panthers Football Club\n* Myrtleford Football Club\n* North Albury Football Club\n* Wangaratta Football Club\n* Wangaratta Rovers Football Club\n* Wodonga Football Club\n* Wodonga Raiders Football Club\n* Yarrawonga Football Club\n\n##Former clubs\n\nSeveral clubs have left the O&MFNL over the years, including:\n\n* Beechworth Football Club (withdrew in 1904)\n* Benalla Football Club (withdrew in 1913)\n* Rutherglen Football Club (merged with Corowa in 1979)\n* Hume Football Club (withdrew in 1997)\n\n#League honour boards\n\n##Premierships\n\nThe O&MFNL has a long and storied history of premiership winners, with several clubs dominating the competition over the years. Wangaratta has won a record 20 premierships, followed closely by Albury with 17.\n\n##Records\n\n###Football: Seniors\n\n* Most games played: 348 (John Longmire, Albury)\n* Most goals kicked: 731 (Garry Ablett Sr., Corowa-Rutherglen)\n* Most best and fairest awards: 4 (John Longmire, Albury)\n\n##Senior Football Premierships (1893-present)\n\n* 1893: Rutherglen\n* 1894: Wangaratta\n* 1895: Benalla\n* 1896: Wangaratta\n* 1897: Rutherglen\n* 1898: Benalla\n* 1899: Wangaratta\n* 1900: Rutherglen\n* 1901: Wangaratta\n* 1902: Benalla\n* 1903: Rutherglen\n* 1904: Wangaratta\n* 1905: Benalla\n* 1906: Rutherglen\n* 1907: Wangaratta\n* 1908: Benalla\n* 1909: Rutherglen\n* 1910: Wangaratta\n* 1911: Benalla\n* 1912: Rutherglen\n* 1913: Wangaratta\n* 1914: Benalla\n* 1915: Rutherglen\n* 1916-1918: No competition due to World War I\n* 1919: Wangaratta\n* 1920: Benalla\n* 1921: Rutherglen\n* 1922: Wangaratta\n* 1923: Benalla\n* 1924: Rutherglen\n* 1925: Wangaratta\n* 1926: Benalla\n* 1927: Rutherglen\n* 1928: Wangaratta\n* 1929: Benalla\n* 1930: Rutherglen\n* 1931: Wangaratta\n* 1932: Benalla\n* 1933: Rutherglen\n* 1934: Wangaratta\n* 1935: Benalla\n* 1936: Rutherglen\n* 1937: Wangaratta\n* 1938: Benalla\n* 1939: Rutherglen\n* 1940-1945: No competition due to World War II\n* 1946: Wangaratta\n* 1947: Benalla\n* 1948: Rutherglen\n* 1949: Wangaratta\n* 1950: Benalla\n* 1951: Rutherglen\n* 1952: Wangaratta\n* 1953: Benalla\n* 1954: Rutherglen\n* 1955: Wangaratta\n* 1956: Benalla\n* 1957: Rutherglen\n* 1958: Wangaratta\n* 1959: Benalla\n* 1960: Rutherglen\n* 1961: Wangaratta\n* 1962: Benalla\n* 1963: Rutherglen\n* 1964: Wangaratta\n* 1965: Benalla\n* 1966: Rutherglen\n* 1967: Wangaratta\n* 1968: Benalla\n* 1969: Rutherglen\n* 1970: Wangaratta\n* 1971: Benalla\n* 1972: Rutherglen\n* 1973: Wangaratta\n* 1974: Benalla\n* 1975: Rutherglen\n* 1976: Wangaratta\n* 1977: Benalla\n* 1978: Rutherglen\n* 1979: Wangaratta\n* 1980: Benalla\n* 1981: Rutherglen\n* 1982: Wangaratta\n* 1983: Benalla\n* 1984: Rutherglen\n* 1985: Wangaratta\n* 1986: Benalla\n* 1987: Rutherglen\n* 1988: Wangaratta\n* 1989: Benalla\n* 1990: Albury\n* 1991: Wangaratta\n* 1992: Benalla\n* 1993: Rutherglen\n* 1994: Wangaratta\n* 1995: Benalla\n* 1996: Albury\n* 1997: Wangaratta\n* 1998: Benalla\n* 1999: Rutherglen\n* 2000: Wangaratta\n* 2001: Albury\n* 2002: Benalla\n* 2003: Rutherglen\n* 2004: Wangaratta\n* 2005: Albury\n* 2006: Benalla\n* 2007: Wangaratta\n* 2008: Albury\n* 2009: Benalla\n* 2010: Wangaratta\n* 2011: Albury\n* 2012: Benalla\n* 2013: Wangaratta\n* 2014: Albury\n* 2015: Benalla\n* 2016: Wangaratta\n* 2017: Albury\n* 2018: Wangaratta\n* 2019: Albury\n* 2020: No competition due to COVID-19 pandemic\n* 2021: Wangaratta\n* 2022: Albury\n* 2023: Wangaratta\n\n##Current finals system\n\nThe O&MFNL currently uses a standard eight-team finals system, with the top eight teams qualifying for the finals series.\n\n###2024 Finals Series\n\nThe 2024 O&MFNL finals series is scheduled to commence on August 31, 2024.\n\n#O&MFNL – Club Championships\n\nThe O&MFNL Club Championship is awarded to the club that accumulates the most points throughout the season, based on results in the senior, reserve, and under 18 grades.\n\n##Cleaver E.

The story will also explore themes of identity, community, and social responsibility, all of which were central to the original film.\n\nCast\n-----\n\nThe cast of Gadar 2 includes:\n\n* Sunny Deol as Tara Singh\n* Ameesha Patel as Sakina\n* Utkarsh Sharma as Jeet\n* Simrat Kaur as Disha\n* Manish Wadhwa as Rajesh Purohit\n* Saurabh Shukla as Dhanraj Singh\n* Rajendra Gupta as Shyamlal\n\nProduction\n------------\n\n### Development\n\nThe development of Gadar 2 began several years ago, with Anil Sharma and Shaktimaan Talwar working on the script. The film's story was inspired by real-life events, including the partition of India and the subsequent migration of people across the border.\n\nThe filmmakers conducted extensive research on the subject, consulting with historians, sociologists, and people who lived through the partition. They also drew inspiration from the original film, incorporating elements of the story and characters into the new narrative.\n\n### Casting\n\nThe casting process for Gadar 2 was a long and selective one, with the filmmakers seeking actors who could bring depth and nuance to their roles. Sunny Deol and Ameesha Patel, who starred in the original film, were the first to be cast, reprising their roles as Tara and Sakina.\n\nUtkarsh Sharma, who made his debut in the 2011 film Genius, was cast as Tara's son, Jeet. Simrat Kaur, a newcomer to Bollywood, was cast as Disha, Jeet's love interest.\n\nSoundtrack\n------------\n\nThe soundtrack for Gadar 2 is being composed by Monty Sharma, who worked on the music for the original film. The score is expected to be a mix of traditional Indian music and modern electronic elements, reflecting the film's blend of action, drama, and romance.\n\nRelease\n--------\n\nGadar 2 is scheduled to release in 2023, with the exact date yet to be announced. The film will be released in theaters across India and worldwide, including in countries with large Indian diaspora communities.\n\n### Home media\n\nThe film will also be released on home media platforms, including DVD, Blu-ray, and digital streaming services.\n\nReception\n------------\n\n### Box office\n\nGadar 2 is expected to perform well at the box office, given the success of the original film and the popularity of its cast. The film's action-packed sequences, romantic storylines, and family-friendly themes are likely to appeal to a broad audience.\n\n### Critical response\n\nThe critical response to Gadar 2 is expected to be mixed, with some critics praising the film's action sequences and performances, while others may find the story and characters to be overly familiar or predictable.\n\n### Accolades\n\nGadar 2 may receive awards and nominations in various categories, including Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Music.\n\nSequel\n--------\n\nA sequel to Gadar 2 is already in the works, with Anil Sharma and Shaktimaan Talwar set to return as director and writer, respectively. The story for the third film is still in development, but it is expected to continue the narrative of the Singh family and their struggles and triumphs.\n\nNotes\n--------\n\nGadar 2 marks a significant milestone in the career of Sunny Deol, who has been working in the film industry for over three decades. The film is also notable for its use of special effects and action sequences, which are expected to be among the most elaborate and expensive in Bollywood history.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nExternal links\n---------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Gadar_2\" following this outline:\n\n#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production\n##Development\n##Casting\n#Soundtrack\n#Release\n##Home media\n#Reception\n##Box office\n##Critical response\n##Accolades\n#Sequel\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The season was marked by a relatively slow start, with the first named storm not forming until early June. However, the season picked up in intensity and frequency as it progressed, with several major hurricanes impacting the Caribbean and the southeastern United States.\n\n# Seasonal Forecasts\n\n## Pre-season forecasts\n\nPrior to the start of the season, several organizations released their forecasts for the 2022 Atlantic hurricane season. These forecasts were based on various factors, including sea surface temperatures, atmospheric conditions, and historical trends. In April 2022, Colorado State University (CSU) released its forecast, predicting 19 named storms, 9 hurricanes, and 4 major hurricanes. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) released its forecast in May 2022, predicting 14-21 named storms, 6-10 hurricanes, and 3-6 major hurricanes.\n\n## Mid-season forecasts\n\nAs the season progressed, these forecasts were updated to reflect the latest trends and conditions. In August 2022, CSU released its mid-season forecast, predicting 18 named storms, 8 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes. NOAA also released its mid-season forecast, predicting 14-20 named storms, 6-9 hurricanes, and 3-5 major hurricanes.\n\n# Seasonal Summary\n\n## Background\n\nThe 2022 Atlantic hurricane season was marked by a complex set of atmospheric and oceanic conditions. A strong La Niña event, which had developed in the preceding year, continued to influence the climate during the 2022 season. La Niña events tend to favor hurricane activity in the Atlantic, as they lead to reduced wind shear and increased instability in the atmosphere.\n\n## Early season activity\n\nThe season began relatively slowly, with the first named storm, Tropical Storm Alex, not forming until June 5. Alex formed in the eastern Atlantic and moved westward, eventually making landfall in Florida as a tropical storm. The next few weeks saw little activity, with only a few tropical waves and disturbances forming in the Atlantic.\n\n## Peak to late season activity\n\nHowever, as the season progressed, activity began to pick up. In late July and early August, several tropical waves formed in the eastern Atlantic, eventually developing into tropical storms Bonnie and Colin. Both storms moved westward, with Bonnie making landfall in Central America and Colin dissipating over the southeastern United States.\n\nThe peak of the season saw the formation of several major hurricanes, including Hurricane Danielle, Hurricane Earl, and Hurricane Fiona. Danielle formed in the eastern Atlantic and moved westward, eventually making landfall in Europe as a post-tropical cyclone. Earl formed in the Caribbean and moved northward, eventually making landfall in Canada as a post-tropical cyclone. Fiona formed in the Caribbean and moved northward, eventually making landfall in Canada as a post-tropical cyclone.\n\n# Systems\n\n## Tropical Storm Alex\n\nTropical Storm Alex formed on June 5 in the eastern Atlantic. Alex moved westward, eventually making landfall in Florida as a tropical storm. The storm caused moderate damage and flooding in the southeastern United States.\n\n## Tropical Storm Bonnie\n\nTropical Storm Bonnie formed on July 25 in the eastern Atlantic. Bonnie moved westward, eventually making landfall in Central America as a tropical storm. The storm caused moderate damage and flooding in Central America.\n\n## Tropical Storm Colin\n\nTropical Storm Colin formed on July 30 in the eastern Atlantic. Colin moved westward, eventually dissipating over the southeastern United States. The storm caused minimal damage and flooding in the southeastern United States.\n\n## Hurricane Danielle\n\nHurricane Danielle formed on August 1 in the eastern Atlantic. Danielle moved westward, eventually making landfall in Europe as a post-tropical cyclone. The storm caused moderate damage and flooding in Europe.\n\n## Hurricane Earl\n\nHurricane Earl formed on August 2 in the Caribbean. Earl moved northward, eventually making landfall in Canada as a post-tropical cyclone. The storm caused moderate damage and flooding in Canada.\n\n## Hurricane Fiona\n\nHurricane Fiona formed on August 14 in the Caribbean. Fiona moved northward, eventually making landfall in Canada as a post-tropical cyclone. The storm caused moderate damage and flooding in Canada.\n\n## Tropical Storm Gaston\n\nTropical Storm Gaston formed on September 20 in the eastern Atlantic. Gaston moved eastward, eventually dissipating over the Atlantic. The storm caused minimal damage and flooding in the Azores.\n\n## Hurricane Ian\n\nHurricane Ian formed on September 23 in the Caribbean. Ian moved northward, eventually making landfall in Florida as a major hurricane.

The club is one of the most successful and popular in Greece, with a record 47 Greek League titles, 28 Greek Cups, and 4 Greek Super Cups. Olympiacos has also had success in European competitions, winning the 2023 UEFA Europa Conference League and reaching the quarter-finals of the UEFA Champions League in 1999.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### Early years (1925–1931)\n\nOlympiacos was founded in 1925 by the members of the Merchant Navy's sports club, with the name Olympiacos Syndesmos Filathlon Pireos (Olympiacos Association of Sports Fans of Piraeus). The club's early years were marked by financial struggles, but they managed to win their first Greek League title in 1931.\n\n### Domination in Greece and World War II (1931–1946)\n\nThe 1930s were a successful period for Olympiacos, with the club winning three Greek League titles and two Greek Cups. However, the outbreak of World War II disrupted football in Greece, and the club's activities were suspended.\n\n### The Legend (1946–1959)\n\nAfter the war, Olympiacos continued to dominate Greek football, winning five Greek League titles and three Greek Cups. The club's success during this period was largely due to the talents of players such as Giorgos Darivas and Elias Yfantis.\n\n### First international success and Márton Bukovi era (1960–1972)\n\nThe 1960s were a significant period for Olympiacos, as the club began to compete in European competitions. In 1960, Olympiacos became the first Greek club to participate in the European Cup, where they reached the quarter-finals, where they were eliminated by Barcelona. The club also won two Greek League titles and one Greek Cup during this period.\n\n### Goulandris era (1972–1975)\n\nIn 1972, Olympiacos was taken over by the Goulandris family, who invested heavily in the club. During this period, Olympiacos won one Greek League title and reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup.\n\n### Domination in the early 1980s, four consecutive League titles (1975–1987)\n\nThe early 1980s were a successful period for Olympiacos, with the club winning four consecutive Greek League titles and two Greek Cups. The club's success during this period was largely due to the talents of players such as Nikos Anastopoulos and Maik Galakos.\n\n### The Stone Years, UEFA Cup quarter-finalists (1987–1996)\n\nThe late 1980s and early 1990s were a difficult period for Olympiacos, with the club facing financial struggles and failing to win any major trophies. However, in 1992, Olympiacos reached the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup, where they were eliminated by Atalanta.\n\n### The Golden Era (1996–2010)\n\n#### Seven consecutive League titles, near-miss to UEFA Champions League semi-finals (1996–2003)\n\nThe 1996-2003 period is considered the golden era of Olympiacos, with the club winning seven consecutive Greek League titles and reaching the quarter-finals of the UEFA Champions League in 2000, where they were eliminated by Valencia.\n\n#### Five consecutive League titles, Two presences in UEFA Champions League knockout phase (2004–2010)\n\nThe 2004-2010 period was also successful for Olympiacos, with the club winning five consecutive Greek League titles and reaching the knockout phase of the UEFA Champions League twice.\n\n### New presidency, seven consecutive League titles and European ascent (2010–2017)\n\nIn 2010, Olympiacos was taken over by a new presidency, which invested heavily in the club. During this period, Olympiacos won seven consecutive Greek League titles and reached the knockout phase of the UEFA Champions League three times.\n\n### European successes, three consecutive Greek League titles (2017–2023)\n\nThe 2017-2023 period was a successful period for Olympiacos, with the club winning three consecutive Greek League titles and reaching the knockout phase of the UEFA Europa League twice. In 2023, Olympiacos won the UEFA Europa Conference League, defeating Marseille 1-0 in the final.\n\n### UEFA Europa Conference League Winners & UEFA Youth League Winners (2023–24)\n\nIn the 2023-24 season, Olympiacos won the UEFA Europa Conference League and the UEFA Youth League, becoming the first Greek club to win a European trophy.\n\nCrest and colours\n-----------------\n\n### Kit evolution\n\nOlympiacos' kit has undergone several changes throughout the club's history. The club's traditional colours are red and white, and their kit usually features a red shirt with white shorts and socks.\n\n### Kit manufacturers and shirt sponsors\n\nOlympiacos' kit is currently manufactured by Adidas, and the club's shirt sponsor is Stoiximan.\n\nStadium\n--------\n\nOlympiacos' home stadium is the Karaiskakis Stadium, which is located in Piraeus, Athens.

{"title": "Indeterminacy_debate_in_legal_theory", "content": "#See also\n#Bibliography\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Indeterminacy Debate in Legal Theory\n\nThe indeterminacy debate in legal theory is a longstanding controversy that questions the extent to which the law is determinate, or clear and predictable, in its application to specific cases. The debate centers on the issue of whether the law is sufficiently determinate to provide a clear answer to every legal question, or whether there are limits to the determinacy of the law.\n\n# Introduction\n\nThe indeterminacy debate has its roots in the early 20th century, when legal scholars began to challenge the traditional view of the law as a clear and predictable system of rules. The debate has since evolved into a complex and multifaceted discussion, involving philosophers, lawyers, and social scientists. At its core, the debate is concerned with the nature of the law and its relationship to the individuals and institutions that apply it.\n\n## The Traditional View of the Law\n\nThe traditional view of the law holds that the law is a determinate system of rules that provides a clear answer to every legal question. According to this view, the law is a coherent and consistent body of rules that can be applied in a mechanical and predictable way to specific cases. This view is often associated with the idea of legal positivism, which holds that the law is a human creation that can be reduced to a set of rules and principles.\n\n## Challenges to the Traditional View\n\nHowever, the traditional view of the law has been challenged by various scholars who argue that the law is not as determinate as it is often assumed to be. One of the main challenges to the traditional view comes from the idea of indeterminacy, which suggests that the law is inherently uncertain and open-ended. According to this view, the law is not a clear and predictable system of rules, but rather a complex and dynamic system that is subject to multiple interpretations and applications.\n\n## Types of Indeterminacy\n\nThere are several types of indeterminacy that have been identified in the literature. One type is linguistic indeterminacy, which refers to the ambiguity and uncertainty of language. Another type is conceptual indeterminacy, which refers to the ambiguity and uncertainty of concepts and categories. Finally, there is also the issue of normative indeterminacy, which refers to the uncertainty and ambiguity of norms and values.\n\n## Implications of Indeterminacy\n\nThe implications of indeterminacy are far-reaching and have significant consequences for the way we think about the law and its application. If the law is indeterminate, then it means that judges and other legal officials have a significant amount of discretion in applying the law to specific cases. This discretion can lead to inconsistent and unpredictable outcomes, which can undermine the rule of law and the legitimacy of the legal system.\n\n## Responses to Indeterminacy\n\nThere are several responses to indeterminacy that have been proposed in the literature. One response is to argue that indeterminacy is not a problem, but rather a natural and inevitable feature of the law. According to this view, the law is inherently complex and dynamic, and indeterminacy is simply a reflection of this complexity. Another response is to argue that indeterminacy can be mitigated through the use of clear and precise language, as well as through the development of more nuanced and sophisticated legal concepts and categories.\n\n## Criticisms of the Indeterminacy Debate\n\nDespite its significance, the indeterminacy debate has been subject to various criticisms. One criticism is that the debate is overly abstract and theoretical, and that it fails to engage with the practical realities of the law. Another criticism is that the debate is too focused on the issue of determinacy, and that it neglects other important issues, such as the relationship between the law and power, or the role of the law in shaping social and cultural norms.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe indeterminacy debate in legal theory is a complex and multifaceted discussion that raises important questions about the nature of the law and its relationship to the individuals and institutions that apply it. While the debate has been subject to various criticisms, it remains a significant and ongoing area of inquiry in the field of legal theory. Ultimately, the indeterminacy debate highlights the complexity and nuance of the law, and the need for ongoing critical reflection and analysis.\n\n# See also\n\n* Legal theory\n* Philosophy of law\n* Indeterminacy\n* Linguistic indeterminacy\n* Conceptual indeterminacy\n* Normative indeterminacy\n* Discretion\n* Rule of law\n* Legitimacy\n\n# Bibliography\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Indeterminacy_debate_in_legal_theory\" following this outline:\n\n#See also\n#Bibliography\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

From ancient civilizations to modern-day athletes, rock climbing has evolved significantly over time, shaped by technological advancements, changing societal values, and the pursuit of adventure. This article provides an overview of the history of rock climbing, highlighting key developments, milestones, and figures that have contributed to the sport's growth and popularity.\n\n# Origins\n\nRock climbing has its roots in ancient cultures, where people would climb rocks and mountains for spiritual, practical, or exploratory purposes. Evidence of early rock climbing can be found in ancient civilizations such as the Egyptians, Greeks, and Chinese, who would often climb rocks and mountains to reach sacred sites, hunt, or gather resources.\n\nIn many indigenous cultures, rock climbing was an integral part of spiritual and cultural practices. For example, in some Native American tribes, rock climbing was a rite of passage for young men, who would climb rocks and mountains to prove their strength, courage, and worthiness.\n\n# 19th century\n\nThe modern concept of rock climbing as a recreational activity emerged in the 19th century in Europe and North America. During this time, the Industrial Revolution had created a new middle class with more leisure time and resources to pursue outdoor activities.\n\nIn the 1860s and 1870s, the Alps became a popular destination for mountaineers and rock climbers, with the first ascents of iconic peaks such as the Matterhorn and the Eiger. The development of new climbing techniques, equipment, and guides facilitated the growth of rock climbing as a sport.\n\n# 1900s\n\nThe early 20th century saw the establishment of the first climbing clubs and organizations, which helped to promote and regulate the sport. In 1902, the Alpine Club of Great Britain was founded, followed by the Sierra Club in the United States in 1892.\n\nDuring this period, rock climbing began to gain popularity as a recreational activity, with the development of new climbing routes and the introduction of new equipment such as pitons and carabiners.\n\n## The Golden Age of Mountaineering\n\nThe 1920s and 1930s are often referred to as the \"Golden Age of Mountaineering.\" During this time, a new generation of climbers emerged, who were driven by a sense of adventure, exploration, and competition.\n\nClimbers such as George Mallory, Andrew Irvine, and Reinhold Messner made headlines with their daring ascents of iconic peaks, pushing the boundaries of what was thought possible.\n\n# 1940s\n\nDuring World War II, rock climbing and mountaineering were put on hold, as many climbers were called to serve in the military. However, the war also saw the development of new climbing techniques and equipment, as soldiers were trained in rock climbing and rope work for military operations.\n\n## The Post-War Era\n\nIn the aftermath of the war, rock climbing experienced a resurgence in popularity, as people sought new ways to experience adventure and freedom. The development of new climbing routes and the introduction of new equipment such as nylon ropes and climbing harnesses facilitated the growth of the sport.\n\n# 1950s\n\nThe 1950s saw the emergence of a new generation of climbers, who were influenced by the counterculture movement and the Beat Generation. Climbers such as Allen Steck, Royal Robbins, and Yvon Chouinard became icons of the sport, pushing the boundaries of what was possible and developing new climbing techniques and equipment.\n\n## The Yosemite Era\n\nThe 1950s and 1960s are often referred to as the \"Yosemite Era\" of rock climbing. During this time, Yosemite National Park became a mecca for rock climbers, with the development of new climbing routes and the introduction of new equipment such as pitons and carabiners.\n\nClimbers such as Warren Harding, Royal Robbins, and Yvon Chouinard made headlines with their daring ascents of iconic peaks such as El Capitan and Half Dome.\n\n# 1960s\n\nThe 1960s saw the emergence of a new style of climbing, characterized by the use of artificial aids such as pitons and ladders. This style of climbing, known as \"aid climbing,\" allowed climbers to ascend routes that were previously thought to be impossible.\n\n## The Clean Climbing Movement\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, a new movement emerged, known as the \"clean climbing\" movement. This movement, led by climbers such as Royal Robbins and Yvon Chouinard, emphasized the importance of climbing without artificial aids, and instead using only the natural features of the rock.\n\n# 1970s\n\nThe 1970s saw the emergence of a new generation of climbers, who were influenced by the clean climbing movement. Climbers such as Lynn Hill, John Bachar, and Ron Kauk became icons of the sport, pushing the boundaries of what was possible and developing new climbing techniques and equipment.\n\n## The Sport Climbing Era\n\nThe 1970s and 1980s saw the emergence of a new style of climbing, known as \"sport climbing.\" This style of climbing, characterized by the use of pre-drilled holes and bolts, allowed climbers to ascend routes quickly and efficiently.\n\n# 1980s\n\nThe 1980s saw the emergence of a new generation of climbers, who were influenced by the sport climbing movement. Climbers such as Wolfgang Güllich, Kurt Albert, and Lynn Hill became icons of the sport, pushing the boundaries of what was possible and developing new climbing techniques and equipment.\n\n## The Competition Climbing Era\n\nThe 1980s and 1990s saw the emergence of a new style of climbing, known as \"competition climbing.\" This style of climbing, characterized by the use of artificial walls and holds, allowed climbers to compete against each other in a controlled environment.\n\n# 1990s\n\nThe 1990s saw the emergence of a new generation of climbers, who were influenced by the competition climbing movement. Climbers such as Chris Sharma, Tommy Caldwell, and Beth Rodden became icons of the sport, pushing the boundaries of what was possible and developing new climbing techniques and equipment.\n\n## The Bouldering Era\n\nThe 1990s and 2000s saw the emergence of a new style of climbing, known as \"bouldering.\" This style of climbing, characterized by the use of short, low-level climbs, allowed climbers to focus on movement and technique.\n\n# 2000s\n\nThe 2000s saw the emergence of a new generation of climbers, who were influenced by the bouldering movement. Climbers such as Daniel Woods, Paul Robinson, and Ashima Shiraishi became icons of the sport, pushing the boundaries of what was possible and developing new climbing techniques and equipment.\n\n## The Climbing Gym Era\n\nThe 2000s and 2010s saw the emergence of a new style of climbing, known as \"indoor climbing.\" This style of climbing, characterized by the use of artificial walls and holds, allowed climbers to climb in a controlled environment.\n\n# 2010s\n\nThe 2010s saw the emergence of a new generation of climbers, who were influenced by the indoor climbing movement. Climbers such as Adam Ondra, Alex Honnold, and Janja Garnbret became icons of the sport, pushing the boundaries of what was possible and developing new climbing techniques and equipment.\n\n## The Free Solo Era\n\nThe 2010s saw the emergence of a new style of climbing, known as \"free solo climbing.\" This style of climbing, characterized by the use of no ropes or safety equipment, allowed climbers to ascend routes quickly and efficiently.\n\n# 2020s\n\nThe 2020s saw the emergence of a new generation of climbers, who were influenced by the free solo movement. Climbers such as Alex Honnold, Tommy Caldwell, and Lynn Hill continued to push the boundaries of what was possible and develop new climbing techniques and equipment.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of climbers\n* List of climbing equipment manufacturers\n* List of climbing routes\n* List of climbing competitions\n\n# Notes\n\n* This article is a general overview of the history of rock climbing, and is not intended to be a comprehensive or exhaustive treatment of the subject.\n* The dates and events listed in this article are approximate and may vary depending on the source.\n\n# References\n\n* (No references are included in this article, as per the requirements.)\n\n# External links\n\n* (No external links are included in this article, as per the requirements.)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"History_of_rock_climbing\" following this outline:\n\n#Origins\n#19th century\n#1900s\n#1910s\n#1920s\n#1930s\n#1940s\n#1950s\n#1960s\n#1970s\n#1980s\n#1990s\n#2000s\n#2010s\n#2020s\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is one of the oldest human technologies, with evidence of pottery dating back to around 9000 BC. Pottery has played a significant role in human culture, serving both practical and aesthetic purposes.\n\nMain Types\n==========\n\nThere are three main types of pottery, classified based on their raw materials, firing temperatures, and resulting properties.\n\n### Earthenware\n\nEarthenware is the most common type of pottery, made from clay that is rich in iron oxide. It is fired at a relatively low temperature, typically between 1000°C to 1150°C, resulting in a hard, non-vitreous, and porous surface. Earthenware is often used for making functional items, such as plates, bowls, and cups.\n\n### Stoneware\n\nStoneware is made from clay that is higher in silica and feldspar than earthenware, resulting in a denser and more durable material. It is fired at a higher temperature, typically between 1150°C to 1300°C, resulting in a hard, non-porous surface. Stoneware is often used for making functional items, such as cups, bowls, and storage containers.\n\n### Porcelain\n\nPorcelain is the most refined type of pottery, made from a specific type of clay called kaolin. It is fired at a very high temperature, typically between 1250°C to 1400°C, resulting in a translucent, hard, and non-porous surface. Porcelain is often used for making decorative items, such as vases, figurines, and jewelry.\n\nArchaeology\n==========\n\nPottery has played a significant role in archaeology, providing valuable insights into ancient cultures and civilizations.\n\n### Fabric Analysis\n\nFabric analysis is a technique used to analyze the composition and structure of pottery. By examining the type of clay, temper, and firing techniques used, archaeologists can reconstruct the manufacturing process and identify the origin of the pottery.\n\nClay Bodies and Raw Materials\n==========================\n\nPottery is made from clay bodies, which are mixtures of clay, water, and other raw materials. The type of clay used determines the properties of the final product.\n\nProduction\n==========\n\nThe production of pottery involves several stages, including shaping, drying, firing, decorating, and glazing.\n\n### Shaping\n\nShaping is the process of creating the desired form from the clay body. This can be done using various techniques, such as hand-building, throwing on a potter's wheel, or using a mold.\n\n### Drying\n\nDrying is the process of removing excess moisture from the clay body. This can be done using various techniques, such as air drying, using a drying rack, or using a controlled environment.\n\n### Firing\n\nFiring is the process of heating the clay body to a high temperature, resulting in the formation of a hard, non-porous surface.\n\n#### Temperature\n\nThe firing temperature determines the properties of the final product. Different types of pottery require different firing temperatures, ranging from 1000°C to 1400°C.\n\n#### Atmosphere\n\nThe firing atmosphere determines the color and texture of the final product. Different types of pottery require different firing atmospheres, ranging from oxidizing to reducing.\n\n#### Methods\n\nFiring methods include electric kilns, gas kilns, raku kilns, and pit firing.\n\n#### Stages\n\nThe firing process involves several stages, including bisque firing, glost firing, and final firing.\n\n### Decorating\n\nDecorating is the process of adding color, texture, and pattern to the pottery. This can be done using various techniques, such as painting, glazing, or using slips and underglazes.\n\n#### Methods\n\nDecorating methods include hand-painting, screen printing, and using decals.\n\n### Glazing\n\nGlazing is the process of applying a layer of glaze to the pottery. Glaze is a mixture of chemicals that melts and forms a glassy surface when fired.\n\n### Health and Environmental Issues\n\nPottery production can pose health and environmental risks, including exposure to toxic materials, dust, and chemicals.\n\nHistory\n=======\n\nPottery has a rich and diverse history, spanning thousands of years.\n\n### Early Pottery\n\nThe earliest evidence of pottery dates back to around 9000 BC, during the Neolithic period. Early pottery was made from unrefined clay and was often decorated with simple patterns.\n\n### History by Region\n\nPottery has played a significant role in human culture, with different regions developing unique styles and techniques.\n\n#### Beginnings of Pottery\n\nThe earliest pottery was made in the Middle East, where archaeologists have discovered evidence of pottery dating back to around 9000 BC.\n\n#### East Asia\n\nEast Asia has a long history of pottery, with evidence of ceramic production dating back to around 6000 BC. Chinese pottery is renowned for its beauty and craftsmanship.\n\n#### South Asia\n\nSouth Asia has a rich tradition of pottery, with evidence of ceramic production dating back to around 3000 BC. Indian pottery is known for its vibrant colors and intricate designs.\n\n#### Southeast Asia\n\nSoutheast Asia has a diverse tradition of pottery, with evidence of ceramic production dating back to around 2000 BC. Southeast Asian pottery is known for its colorful glazes and intricate patterns.\n\n#### West Asia\n\nWest Asia has a long history of pottery, with evidence of ceramic production dating back to around 5000 BC. Persian pottery is renowned for its beauty and craftsmanship.\n\n#### Europe\n\nEurope has a rich tradition of pottery, with evidence of ceramic production dating back to around 3000 BC. Greek pottery is renowned for its beauty and craftsmanship.\n\n#### United Kingdom\n\nThe United Kingdom has a long history of pottery, with evidence of ceramic production dating back to around 2000 BC.

The exodus was a result of the rise of militancy in the region and the subsequent persecution of the Kashmiri Hindu community. The event is considered one of the most significant and traumatic events in the history of the Kashmiri Hindu community.\n\n#Background\n\nThe Kashmir Valley has historically been home to a significant population of Kashmiri Hindus, also known as Kashmiri Pandits. The community has a rich cultural and intellectual heritage, and has played a significant role in the region's history and politics. However, the community has faced persecution and marginalization on several occasions, including during the reign of the Muslim ruler Sultan Sikandar in the 14th century and during the Dogra rule in the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nIn the 1980s, the Kashmir Valley began to experience a rise in militancy, with several militant groups emerging to fight for independence from India or merger with Pakistan. The militancy was initially focused on armed struggle, but soon turned to targeting the Kashmiri Hindu community.

Heard\n\nDepp v. Heard was a highly publicized defamation trial in the United States, in which actor Johnny Depp sued his ex-wife Amber Heard for damages over an op-ed she wrote for The Washington Post in 2018. The trial, which took place in Fairfax County, Virginia, drew widespread attention due to the celebrity status of the parties involved and the intense media scrutiny.\n\n# Background\n\n## Depp and Heard's relationship\n\nJohnny Depp and Amber Heard met in 2009 and began a romantic relationship. They got married in 2015, but their union was short-lived, as they announced their separation in 2016 and their divorce was finalized in 2017. During their relationship, there were reports of domestic violence and abuse, with both parties accusing each other of mistreating the other.\n\n## Depp v News Group Newspapers Ltd\n\nIn 2020, Depp lost a libel case against News Group Newspapers Ltd, the publisher of The Sun, over an article that called him a \"wife-beater\". The court ruled that the article was \"substantially true\", based on evidence presented by Heard. This ruling was seen as a major setback for Depp, who had denied the allegations of abuse.\n\n## Heard's op-ed in The Washington Post\n\nIn December 2018, Heard wrote an op-ed for The Washington Post, in which she described herself as a survivor of domestic abuse. While she did not mention Depp by name, the article was widely interpreted as referring to their relationship. Depp's lawyers claimed that the article implied that he was the abuser, and that this was part of a larger campaign by Heard to ruin his reputation.\n\n## Waldman's comments in the Daily Mail\n\nIn 2021, Depp's lawyer Adam Waldman made comments to the Daily Mail, in which he accused Heard of orchestrating a \"hoax\" against Depp. Waldman claimed that Heard had fabricated the allegations of abuse, and that she had coached her friends and family to corroborate her story. Heard's lawyers responded by accusing Waldman of making defamatory statements.\n\n# Civil action\n\n## Pre-trial developments\n\nIn 2019, Depp filed a lawsuit against Heard, claiming that she had defamed him in the op-ed. Heard responded by filing a counterclaim, in which she accused Depp of orchestrating a \"smear campaign\" against her. The case was originally scheduled to go to trial in 2020, but it was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## Trial\n\n### Opening statements\n\nThe trial began on April 11, 2022, with opening statements from both sides. Depp's lawyer, Camille Vasquez, claimed that Heard had fabricated the allegations of abuse, and that she had used them to advance her own career. Heard's lawyer, J. Benjamin Rottenborn, responded by accusing Depp of being a \"monster\" who had subjected Heard to years of physical and emotional abuse.\n\n### Testimony\n\nDuring the trial, both Depp and Heard took the stand to testify. Depp claimed that he had never hit Heard, and that she had been the aggressor in their relationship. Heard testified that Depp had subjected her to years of abuse, including physical and emotional attacks.\n\n### Closing arguments\n\nOn May 27, 2022, both sides presented their closing arguments. Depp's lawyer, Vasquez, claimed that Heard had failed to prove that she had been abused, and that Depp was entitled to damages. Heard's lawyer, Rottenborn, responded by accusing Depp of being a \"liar\" who had manipulated the court.\n\n### Verdict\n\nOn June 1, 2022, the jury delivered its verdict, finding that Heard had defamed Depp in three statements in the op-ed. The jury awarded Depp $10.35 million in damages. Heard was awarded $2 million in damages on one of her counterclaims.\n\n## Post-trial motions\n\nAfter the verdict, both sides filed post-trial motions, with Depp seeking to increase the damages award and Heard seeking to set aside the verdict. In July 2022, the judge denied both motions.\n\n## Appeals, settlement and carrier lawsuit\n\nIn July 2022, Heard announced that she would be appealing the verdict. Depp has also announced that he will be appealing the $2 million damages award to Heard. In December 2022, it was announced that both parties had reached a settlement, with Heard agreeing to pay Depp $1 million in damages. In January 2023, Depp's insurance carrier filed a lawsuit against Heard, claiming that she was responsible for the damages awarded to Depp.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## Livestream\n\nThe trial was livestreamed on various platforms, including YouTube and Law & Crime Network. The livestream drew millions of viewers, with many people tuning in to watch the dramatic moments of the trial.\n\n## Social media coverage\n\nThe trial received widespread coverage on social media, with many people using hashtags such as #JusticeForJohnny and #IStandWithAmber to express their support for either side. The social media coverage was often intense and polarized, with many people accusing each other of being biased or misinformed.\n\n## Comments by juror\n\nIn an interview with Good Morning America, one of the jurors claimed that the jury had been swayed by Depp's testimony, and that they had found Heard to be \"inconsistent\" and \"unreliable\".\n\n## The Washington Post\n\nThe Washington Post, which had published Heard's op-ed, issued a statement after the verdict, saying that they stood by their decision to publish the article.\n\n## Commentary on verdict\n\nMany commentators have weighed in on the verdict, with some accusing the jury of being biased towards Depp and others claiming that the verdict was a victory for free speech. Some have also criticized the trial for being overly dramatic and sensationalized.\n\n# Media coverage\n\n## Film adaptation\n\nIn November 2022, it was announced that a film adaptation of the trial was in the works, with actress Eva Green set to play Heard.\n\n## Books\n\nSeveral books have been written about the trial, including a bestselling memoir by Depp's lawyer, Camille Vasquez.\n\n## TV\n\nThe trial has been the subject of several TV shows, including a documentary series on the Law & Crime Network.\n\n## Podcast\n\nThe trial has also been covered on several podcasts, including the popular true crime podcast, Crime Junkie.\n\n# See also\n\n* Domestic violence\n* Defamation\n* Johnny Depp\n* Amber Heard\n\n# References\n\n# External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Depp_v._Heard\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Depp and Heard's relationship\n##Depp v News Group Newspapers Ltd\n##Heard's op-ed in The Washington Post\n##Waldman's comments in the Daily Mail\n#Civil action\n##Pre-trial developments\n##Trial\n###Opening statements\n###Testimony\n###Closing arguments\n###Verdict\n##Post-trial motions\n##Appeals, settlement and carrier lawsuit\n#Reactions\n##Livestream\n##Social media coverage\n##Comments by juror\n##The Washington Post\n##Commentary on verdict\n#Media coverage\n##Film adaptation\n##Books\n##TV\n##Podcast\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The booster is powered by a cluster of Raptor engines, which provide a combined thrust of over 16 million pounds.\n\n### Tanks\n\nThe Super Heavy booster has a diameter of 9 meters (30 feet) and a height of 69 meters (226 feet). The booster is equipped with two tanks: a liquid oxygen tank and a liquid methane tank. The tanks are made of stainless steel and are designed to be reusable.\n\n### Propulsion\n\nThe Super Heavy booster is powered by a cluster of Raptor engines, which are fueled by liquid methane and liquid oxygen. The Raptor engine is a full-flow staged combustion cycle engine that produces a thrust of over 2 million pounds.\n\n### Interstage\n\nThe interstage is the section of the Super Heavy booster that connects the booster to the Starship spacecraft. The interstage is equipped with a thrust vector control system, which allows the booster to adjust its trajectory during flight.\n\n## Starship spacecraft\n\nThe Starship spacecraft is a reusable spacecraft that is designed to take both people and cargo to the Moon, Mars, and other destinations in the solar system. The spacecraft is equipped with a heat shield, a propulsion system, and a life support system.\n\n### Heat shield\n\nThe heat shield is a critical component of the Starship spacecraft, as it protects the spacecraft from the intense heat generated during re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere. The heat shield is made of a ceramic material that is designed to withstand temperatures of up to 1,500 degrees Celsius.\n\n### Variants\n\nThere are several variants of the Starship spacecraft, including a crewed version and a cargo version. The crewed version is designed to carry up to 100 passengers, while the cargo version is designed to carry up to 150 tons of cargo.\n\n## Raptor engine\n\nThe Raptor engine is a full-flow staged combustion cycle engine that is used to power the Super Heavy booster and the Starship spacecraft. The engine produces a thrust of over 2 million pounds and is fueled by liquid methane and liquid oxygen.\n\n# Versions\n\nThere have been several versions of the Starship spacecraft, including Block 1, Block 2, and Block 3.\n\n## Block 1\n\nBlock 1 was the first version of the Starship spacecraft and was used for a series of low-altitude flight tests. The Block 1 spacecraft was equipped with a single Raptor engine and a heat shield.\n\n## Block 2\n\nBlock 2 was the second version of the Starship spacecraft and was used for a series of higher-altitude flight tests. The Block 2 spacecraft was equipped with three Raptor engines and a more advanced heat shield.\n\n## Block 3\n\nBlock 3 is the current version of the Starship spacecraft and is designed for orbital flight. The Block 3 spacecraft is equipped with six Raptor engines and a more advanced life support system.\n\n# Planned launch and landing profile\n\nThe planned launch and landing profile for the Starship spacecraft involves a vertical takeoff and landing. The spacecraft will lift off from a launch pad and ascend to an altitude of over 100 kilometers. The spacecraft will then re-enter the Earth's atmosphere and land vertically on a landing pad.\n\n# Development\n\nThe development of the Starship spacecraft has been ongoing since 2012.\n\n## Early design concepts (2012–2019)\n\nThe early design concepts for the Starship spacecraft involved a series of iterations, including a vertical takeoff and landing (VTVL) concept and a horizontal takeoff and landing (HTVL) concept.\n\n## Low-altitude flight tests (2019–2021)\n\nThe low-altitude flight tests for the Starship spacecraft began in 2019 and involved a series of short flights to an altitude of over 500 meters.\n\n### Starhopper to SN6\n\nThe first low-altitude flight test was conducted using a prototype called Starhopper.

The girls could purchase these items during recess or after school.\n\n## Fete\n\nThe annual fete was a grand event that brought together the girls, parents, and teachers.

All 150 seats were up for election.\n\n# Background\n\nThe 2022 Texas House of Representatives election took place against the backdrop of a highly competitive and polarized national political landscape. The election was also influenced by local and state-level issues, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, economic concerns, and debates over education and healthcare policy.\n\n# Redistricting\n\nFollowing the 2020 United States Census, Texas underwent a redistricting process, which resulted in changes to the boundaries of many state legislative districts. The redistricting process was contentious, with allegations of gerrymandering and disputes over the representation of minority communities.\n\n## Seats without incumbents\n\nThere were several seats without incumbents in the 2022 Texas House of Representatives election. These included seats that were vacated due to retirements or resignations, as well as new seats created through the redistricting process.\n\n## Double-bunked incumbents\n\nIn some cases, the redistricting process resulted in two incumbents being drawn into the same district. This led to several high-profile primary contests between sitting legislators.\n\n# Retirements\n\nSeveral members of the Texas House of Representatives announced their retirements or declined to seek re-election in 2022. These included both Democrats and Republicans, and were attributed to a variety of factors, including term limits, personal health concerns, and a desire to pursue other opportunities.\n\n# Special elections\n\nIn the run-up to the 2022 general election, there were several special elections held to fill vacancies in the Texas House of Representatives. These elections were held to replace legislators who had resigned or passed away, and were seen as indicative of the competitive landscape of the general election.\n\n# Incumbents defeated\n\nSeveral incumbents were defeated in the 2022 Texas House of Representatives election, including both Democrats and Republicans.\n\n## In primaries\n\nThere were several instances of incumbents being defeated in primary elections.\n\n### Democrats\n\nSeveral Democratic incumbents were defeated in primary elections, including [insert names].\n\n### Republicans\n\nSeveral Republican incumbents were also defeated in primary elections, including [insert names].\n\n# Predictions\n\nPollsters and analysts made various predictions about the outcome of the 2022 Texas House of Representatives election.\n\n## Statewide\n\nStatewide, polls suggested that the Republican Party would maintain its majority in the Texas House of Representatives, with some analysts predicting a slight increase in the Republican majority.\n\n## Competitive districts\n\nHowever, several districts were identified as competitive, with polls suggesting that the outcome could be close.\n\n# Summary of results\n\nThe results of the 2022 Texas House of Representatives election were as follows:\n\n## Statewide\n\nStatewide, the Republican Party maintained its majority in the Texas House of Representatives, winning [insert number] seats to the Democratic Party's [insert number].\n\n## Close races\n\nSeveral districts were highly competitive, with some contests decided by narrow margins.\n\n## Results by district\n\nThe results of the 2022 Texas House of Representatives election by district were as follows:\n\n# Detailed results\n\nThe detailed results of the 2022 Texas House of Representatives election by district were as follows:\n\n## District 1\n\n[Insert information about District 1]\n\n## District 2\n\n[Insert information about District 2]\n\n...\n\n## District 150\n\n[Insert information about District 150]\n\n# See also\n\n* 2022 Texas elections\n* 2022 United States House of Representatives elections in Texas\n* 2022 Texas Senate election\n\n# Notes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Texas_House_of_Representatives_election\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Redistricting\n##Seats without incumbents\n##Double-bunked incumbents\n#Retirements\n#Special elections\n#Incumbents defeated\n##In primaries\n###Democrats\n###Republicans\n#Predictions\n##Statewide\n##Competitive districts\n#Summary of results\n##Statewide\n##Close races\n##Results by district\n#Detailed results\n##District 1\n##District 2\n##District 3\n##District 4\n##District 5\n##District 6\n##District 7\n##District 8\n##District 9\n##District 10\n##District 11\n##District 12\n##District 13\n##District 14\n##District 15\n##District 16\n##District 17\n##Districts 18\n##Districts 19\n##District 20\n##District 21\n##District 22\n##District 23\n##District 24\n##District 25\n##District 26\n##District 27\n##District 28\n##District 29\n##District 30\n##District 31\n##District 32\n##District 33\n##District 34\n##District 35\n##District 36\n##District 37\n##District 38\n##District 39\n##District 40\n##District 41\n##District 42\n##District 43\n##District 44\n##District 45\n##District 46\n##District 47\n##District 48\n##District 49\n##District 50\n##District 51\n##District 52\n##District 53\n##District 54\n##District 55\n##District 56\n##District 57\n##District 58\n##District 59\n##District 60\n##District 61\n##District 62\n##District 63\n##District 64\n##District 65\n##District 66\n##District 67\n##District 68\n##District 69\n##District 70\n##District 71\n##District 72\n##District 73\n##District 74\n##District 75\n##District 76\n##District 77\n##District 78\n##District 79\n##District 80\n##District 81\n##District 82\n##District 83\n##District 84\n##District 85\n##District 86\n##District 87\n##District 88\n##District 89\n##District 90\n##District 91\n##District 92\n##District 93\n##District 94\n##District 95\n##District 96\n##District 97\n##District 98\n##District 99\n##District 100\n##District 101\n##District 102\n##District 103\n##District 104\n##District 105\n##District 106\n##District 107\n##District 108\n##District 109\n##District 110\n##District 111\n##District 112\n##District 113\n##District 114\n##District 115\n##District 116\n##District 117\n##District 118\n##District 119\n##District 120\n##District 121\n##District 122\n##District 123\n##District 124\n##District 125\n##District 126\n##District 127\n##District 128\n##District 129\n##District 130\n##District 131\n##District 132\n##District 133\n##District 134\n##District 135\n##District 136\n##District 137\n##District 138\n##District 139\n##District 140\n##District 141\n##District 142\n##District 143\n##District 144\n##District 145\n##District 146\n##District 147\n##District 148\n##District 149\n##District 150\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The club has a rich history in Cypriot basketball, having won numerous domestic and international titles. AEL Limassol B.C. is one of the most successful and popular basketball teams in Cyprus, with a loyal fan base and a strong reputation in European competitions.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### Founding, early years & First Golden Age (1966–1988)\n\nAEL Limassol B.C. was founded in 1966 as a part of the Athlitiki Enosis Limassol (AEL) sports club, which was established in 1930. The basketball team quickly gained popularity and success, winning their first Cypriot Championship in 1967. During the 1970s and 1980s, AEL Limassol B.C. experienced a golden age, winning multiple domestic titles and competing in European competitions. The team's success during this period was largely due to the talent and dedication of players such as Giorgos Anastasiadis and Giannis Ioannou.\n\n### Decline, relegation & return to glory (1989–2001)\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, AEL Limassol B.C. experienced a decline in fortunes, resulting in relegation to the Cypriot Second Division in 1991. However, the team bounced back quickly, earning promotion to the top division in 1993. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, AEL Limassol B.C. began to rebuild and regain their former glory, winning several domestic cups and competing in European competitions.\n\n### Second Golden Age & various European successes (2002–2010)\n\n#### The initial Dragan Raca era (2002–2005)\n\nIn 2002, AEL Limassol B.C. appointed Dragan Raca as their head coach, marking the beginning of a new golden age for the team. Under Raca's guidance, AEL Limassol B.C. won multiple domestic titles and competed in European competitions such as the FIBA EuroCup and the FIBA EuroChallenge. The team's success during this period was largely due to the talent and leadership of players such as Giorgos Anastasiadis and Giannis Ioannou.\n\n#### Organising the FIBA EuroCup All-Star Day Limassol & interest to join Greek A1 Basketball League (2006–2008)\n\nIn 2006, AEL Limassol B.C. organized the FIBA EuroCup All-Star Day Limassol, a showcase event that brought together some of the top players and teams in European basketball.

Although this move ultimately did not materialize, it demonstrated the team's ambition and desire to compete at the highest level.\n\n#### Transformation from EuroChallenge contenders to EuroChallenge favourites (2008–2010)\n\nBetween 2008 and 2010, AEL Limassol B.C. transformed from EuroChallenge contenders to EuroChallenge favourites, competing in the Final Four of the competition in 2009. The team's success during this period was largely due to the talent and leadership of players such as Giorgos Anastasiadis and Giannis Ioannou, as well as the guidance of head coach Dragan Raca.\n\n### Descent into obscurity, dissolution & reformation (2011–2017)\n\nIn 2011, AEL Limassol B.C. began to experience a decline in fortunes, resulting in relegation to the Cypriot Second Division in 2012. The team eventually dissolved in 2014, only to be reformed in 2016. During this period, the team competed in the Cypriot Third Division, eventually earning promotion to the Second Division in 2017.\n\n### Recent history (2018–present)\n\n#### Return to Division A & reaching two Cup finals (2018–2022)\n\nIn 2018, AEL Limassol B.C. returned to the Cypriot Division A, the top domestic league in Cyprus.

It was a rebellion of gold miners against the colonial authority of the British Empire, and is often regarded as the birthplace of Australian democracy.\n\n#Origins in the Victorian gold rush\n\nThe Victorian gold rush, which began in 1851, brought a large influx of immigrants to the region, including many from China, Europe, and North America. The gold rush created a significant economic boom, but also led to tensions between the miners and the colonial authorities.\n\n##Protests on the goldfields: 1851–1854\n\nAs the gold rush gained momentum, protests began to emerge on the goldfields. Miners were dissatisfied with the colonial government's handling of the goldfields, particularly the introduction of a monthly mining tax.\n\n###La Trobe introduces monthly mining tax as protests begin\n\nIn 1851, Governor Charles La Trobe introduced a monthly mining tax of 30 shillings, which miners saw as excessive and unfair. The tax was levied on all miners, regardless of whether they had found gold or not. This led to widespread protests and petitions, which La Trobe largely ignored.\n\n###First gold commissioner arrives in Ballarat\n\nIn 1852, the first gold commissioner, Robert William Rede, arrived in Ballarat. Rede was tasked with enforcing the mining tax and maintaining order on the goldfields. However, he quickly became unpopular with the miners, who saw him as corrupt and biased towards the wealthy.\n\n###Bendigo Petition and the Red Ribbon Movement\n\nIn 1853, a petition was circulated in Bendigo, calling for the abolition of the mining tax and the introduction of democratic reforms. The petition was signed by over 5,000 miners and was presented to Governor La Trobe. However, La Trobe rejected the petition, leading to the formation of the Red Ribbon Movement, a protest group that wore red ribbons on their hats to symbolize their opposition to the government.\n\n###Legislative Council calls for Commission of Inquiry\n\nIn 1854, the Legislative Council, the upper house of the Victorian parliament, called for a Commission of Inquiry into the goldfields. The commission was tasked with investigating the miners' grievances and making recommendations for reform.\n\n###Hotham replaces La Trobe\n\nIn 1854, Governor La Trobe was replaced by Sir Charles Hotham, who was tasked with resolving the crisis on the goldfields. However, Hotham proved to be just as unpopular as La Trobe, and the tensions between the miners and the government continued to escalate.\n\n#Tensions escalate\n\nThe tensions between the miners and the government continued to escalate throughout 1854. The miners became increasingly frustrated with the government's refusal to listen to their grievances, and the government became increasingly concerned about the threat to its authority.\n\n##Murder of James Scobie and the burning of the Eureka hotel\n\nIn October 1854, a miner named James Scobie was murdered outside the Eureka hotel in Ballarat. The hotel was owned by James Bentley, a wealthy and influential businessman who was known for his corrupt dealings with the government. The miners suspected that Bentley was involved in Scobie's murder, and they rioted, burning down the Eureka hotel.\n\n##Ballarat Reform League meetings\n\nIn response to the murder of Scobie and the burning of the Eureka hotel, the Ballarat Reform League was formed. The league was a coalition of miners, tradesmen, and other community leaders who were committed to democratic reform. The league held regular meetings, at which they discussed strategies for achieving reform and resisting government oppression.\n\n##Escalating violence as military convoy looted\n\nIn November 1854, a military convoy was sent to Ballarat to quell the unrest. However, the convoy was intercepted by a group of miners, who looted the supplies and equipment. The government responded by sending more troops to the goldfields, which only served to escalate the violence.\n\n#Open rebellion\n\nThe tensions between the miners and the government finally boiled over in December 1854, when the miners declared open rebellion.\n\n##Paramilitary mobilisation and swearing allegiance to the Southern Cross\n\nThe miners formed a paramilitary organization, which they called the Ballarat Reform League Military. The league was led by Peter Lalor, a young Irish immigrant who would become a hero of the rebellion. The miners swore allegiance to the Southern Cross, a flag that they had designed to symbolize their rebellion.\n\n###Fortification of the Eureka lead\n\nThe miners fortified the Eureka lead, a stockade that they had built to protect themselves from the government's forces. The stockade was surrounded by a wall of earth and timber, and was defended by over 150 miners.\n\n####Vinegar Hill blunder: Irish dimension factors in dwindling numbers at stockade\n\nHowever, the miners made a critical mistake when they allowed a group of Irish miners to leave the stockade to attend a meeting at nearby Vinegar Hill. The Irish miners were not aware of the government's plans to attack the stockade, and they were not present when the attack occurred.\n\n####Departing detachment of Independent Californian Rangers leaves small garrison behind\n\nA detachment of the Independent Californian Rangers, a group of American miners who had joined the rebellion, also left the stockade to return to their homes. This left a small garrison of miners to defend the stockade against the government's forces.\n\n##Battle of the Eureka Stockade\n\nOn December 3, 1854, the government's forces attacked the Eureka stockade, killing over 30 miners and wounding many more. The battle was short and brutal, and the miners were quickly overwhelmed. Peter Lalor was wounded in the battle, and he was forced to flee to avoid capture.\n\n#Aftermath\n\nThe aftermath of the battle was marked by widespread outrage and grief. The miners were shocked and saddened by the loss of their comrades, and the government was condemned for its brutality.\n\n##Trials for sedition and high treason\n\nThe government arrested over 100 miners and charged them with sedition and high treason. However, the trials were widely seen as a sham, and many of the miners were acquitted or released on bail.\n\n##Commission of Inquiry report\n\nThe Commission of Inquiry into the goldfields, which had been established in 1854, finally reported in 1855. The commission's report was highly critical of the government's handling of the goldfields, and it recommended significant reforms.\n\n##Peter Lalor enters parliament\n\nIn 1856, Peter Lalor was elected to the Victorian parliament, where he became a leading advocate for democratic reform. Lalor played a key role in the introduction of the Electoral Reform Act, which extended the franchise to all male citizens.\n\n#Location of Bakery Hill and the Eureka Stockade\n\nThe Eureka Stockade was located on Bakery Hill, a small hill in Ballarat that overlooked the goldfields. The stockade was situated near the intersection of Eureka Street and Stawell Street, and it was surrounded by a wall of earth and timber.\n\n#Political legacy\n\nThe Eureka Rebellion had a profound impact on Australian politics. It marked the beginning of the democratic movement in Australia, and it paved the way for the introduction of democratic reforms.\n\n#Commemoration\n\nThe Eureka Rebellion has been commemorated in a variety of ways over the years.\n\n##19th century\n\nIn the 19th century, the rebellion was commemorated by the miners themselves, who held annual meetings and processions to mark the anniversary of the battle.\n\n##20th century\n\nIn the 20th century, the rebellion was commemorated by the Australian government, which established the Eureka Stockade Memorial Park in Ballarat. The park features a monument to the miners who died in the battle, as well as a museum and a recreation of the stockade.\n\n##21st century\n\nIn the 21st century, the rebellion has been commemorated by a variety of community groups and organizations. The Eureka Stockade Memorial Park has been upgraded and expanded, and a new museum has been established to tell the story of the rebellion.\n\n#Popular culture\n\nThe Eureka Rebellion has been depicted in a variety of forms of popular culture, including films, plays, and novels. The rebellion has been the subject of numerous books and articles, and it has been commemorated in music and art.\n\n#See also\n\n* Australian gold rushes\n* Ballarat Reform League\n* Eureka Stockade Memorial Park\n* Peter Lalor\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is a general overview of the Eureka Rebellion.

The album marked the band's 20th anniversary and was their first release in four years, following the critically acclaimed Honour-Valour-Pride (2001). Those Once Loyal continued Bolt Thrower's tradition of creating heavy, atmospheric, and introspective music, exploring themes of mortality, sacrifice, and the consequences of war.\n\nBackground and recording\n-------------------------\n\nThose Once Loyal was recorded at Sable Rose Studios in Coventry, England, with the band's longtime producer, Andy Faulkner.

She gained notoriety for posing as a wealthy heiress and scamming individuals and businesses in New York City. Her crimes and subsequent trial drew widespread media attention, cementing her status as a notorious figure in popular culture.\n\n#Early life\n\nAnna Sorokin was born on January 23, 1991, in Domodedovo, Russia. Her father, Vladimir Sorokin, is a Russian businessman who owns a transportation company. In 2007, the family moved to Germany, where Sorokin attended high school. After completing her education, she moved to Paris to pursue a career in fashion. However, she soon became disillusioned with the fashion industry and relocated to New York City in 2013.\n\nIn New York, Sorokin reinvented herself as \"Anna Delvey,\" a supposed heiress to a wealthy Russian fortune. She quickly gained a reputation as a lavish spender, often dining at upscale restaurants and staying at luxury hotels. Her social media presence also reflected her supposed wealth, with posts showcasing designer clothing and exotic vacations.\n\n#Fraud\n\nSorokin's scams typically involved posing as a wealthy heiress and promising to pay for goods and services with a non-existent credit card or wire transfer. She would often make reservations at high-end restaurants and hotels, only to claim that her credit card had been declined or that she was waiting for a wire transfer. In some cases, she would also promise to invest in businesses or pay for services, only to fail to follow through on her commitments.\n\nOne of Sorokin's most notable scams involved a private jet company, which she convinced to let her use a plane for a trip to Nebraska. She promised to pay for the flight with a wire transfer, but the payment never materialized. The company was left with a $35,000 bill, which Sorokin refused to pay.\n\nSorokin's scams also targeted individuals, including a friend who loaned her $62,000 to cover rent and other expenses. When the friend asked for repayment, Sorokin claimed that she was waiting for a wire transfer from her father.\n\n#Indictment and arrest\n\nIn October 2017, Sorokin was arrested at a New York City hotel and charged with multiple counts of grand larceny and theft of services. The indictment alleged that she had scammed individuals and businesses out of over $275,000.\n\nSorokin's arrest was the result of a months-long investigation by the New York City Police Department. The investigation was sparked by complaints from several of Sorokin's victims, who reported that she had failed to pay for goods and services.\n\n#Trial, conviction, and sentence\n\nSorokin's trial began in March 2019 and lasted for several weeks. The prosecution presented evidence of Sorokin's scams, including emails and text messages in which she promised to pay for goods and services. The defense argued that Sorokin was a \"daddy's girl\" who was used to getting what she wanted and didn't realize the harm she was causing.\n\nOn April 25, 2019, the jury delivered a guilty verdict on multiple counts of grand larceny and theft of services. Sorokin was sentenced to four to 12 years in prison and ordered to pay restitution to her victims.\n\n#ICE custody\n\nIn February 2021, Sorokin was released from prison after serving two years of her sentence. However, she was immediately taken into custody by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) due to her immigration status. Sorokin's visa had expired, and she was deemed a \"public charge\" due to her history of crime.\n\nSorokin's ICE custody was widely reported in the media, with many outlets speculating about her future. In May 2021, it was announced that Sorokin would be deported to Germany, where she would face additional charges related to her scams.\n\n#Media representation\n\nSorokin's story has been the subject of numerous media reports and documentaries. In 2022, a Netflix series based on her life, \"Inventing Anna,\" premiered to mixed reviews. The series starred Anna Chlumsky as a journalist who becomes obsessed with Sorokin's story.\n\nSorokin has also been the subject of several books, including \"My Friend Anna\" by Rachel Williams, a journalist who befriended Sorokin while working on a story about her.\n\n##Art shows\n\nIn 2022, Sorokin announced that she would be hosting an art show in New York City. The show, titled \"Free Anna,\" featured works by Sorokin and several other artists. The show was widely publicized, with many outlets reporting on Sorokin's latest venture.\n\n##Non-fungible tokens\n\nIn 2022, Sorokin announced that she would be releasing a series of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) based on her artwork. The NFTs were available for purchase on a cryptocurrency platform and quickly sold out.\n\n##Fashion\n\nSorokin has long been interested in fashion, and has modeled for several brands. In 2022, she announced that she would be launching her own fashion line, which would feature a range of clothing and accessories.\n\n#Personal life\n\nSorokin's personal life has been the subject of much speculation over the years. In 2022, she announced that she was engaged to a man named Algernon Cargill, a financier who had met Sorokin while she was in prison.\n\n#See also\n\n* Con artist\n* Socialite\n* White-collar crime\n* Immigration and Customs Enforcement\n\n#References\n\n[Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements.]\n\n#External links\n\n[Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements.]", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Anna_Sorokin\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n#Fraud\n#Indictment and arrest\n#Trial, conviction, and sentence\n#ICE custody\n#Media representation\n#After prison\n##Art shows\n##Non-fungible tokens\n##Fashion\n#Personal life\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Jackson pursued higher education at the University of London, graduating with a degree in accounting. He later qualified as a chartered accountant, a designation that would serve as the foundation for his future career.\n\n#Career\n\n##Accounting\n\nJackson began his career in accounting, working with several firms in the United Kingdom. During this period, he gained valuable experience in financial management, auditing, and taxation. His expertise in accounting eventually led to his appointment as a partner at a prominent accounting firm, where he worked with various clients across multiple industries.\n\n##Period at BTR and subsidiaries\n\nIn 1986, Jackson joined BTR plc as the Group Financial Controller. BTR, a British conglomerate, was facing significant challenges at the time, including declining profits and a lack of clear direction.

During his tenure, he implemented a series of bold initiatives aimed at transforming the company into a more focused, global enterprise. He oversaw the disposal of non-core businesses, invested in emerging markets, and established partnerships with key suppliers and customers.\n\nJackson's leadership at BTR was marked by a series of high-profile acquisitions, including the purchase of the American conglomerate, Hawker Siddeley. The acquisition expanded BTR's presence in the United States and added new businesses to its portfolio, including manufacturers of aerospace and defense products.\n\n##Later career\n\nJackson stepped down as Chief Executive of BTR in 1999, following the company's merger with the American conglomerate, Siebe plc. The merged entity, Invensys plc, was one of the largest industrial conglomerates in the world, with operations in over 60 countries.\n\nAfter leaving Invensys, Jackson went on to pursue various business interests, including private equity investments and non-executive directorships. He has served on the boards of several companies, including the British engineering firm, GKN plc, and the American aerospace company, Rockwell Collins.\n\n#Honours, awards and fellowships\n\n##Honours\n\nJackson has received several honours for his contributions to British industry. In 1996, he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) by Queen Elizabeth II. He has also been awarded honorary doctorates by several universities, including the University of London and the University of Warwick.\n\n##Awards\n\nJackson has received numerous awards for his leadership and business acumen. In 1998, he was named the \"Business Leader of the Year\" by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI). He has also received awards from the Institute of Directors and the Financial Times.\n\n##Fellowships\n\nJackson is a fellow of several professional bodies, including the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW) and the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA).

It can be caused by a variety of factors, including high altitude, anemia, and respiratory or cardiovascular disease. Hypoxia can lead to damage to various tissues and organs, including the brain, heart, and kidneys. In severe cases, it can be life-threatening.\n\nClassification\n-------------\n\nHypoxia can be classified in several ways, including by cause, extent, and affected tissues and organs.\n\n### By cause\n\nHypoxia can be caused by a variety of factors, including ischemia, hypoxemic hypoxia, anemia, and histotoxic hypoxia.\n\n### By extent\n\nHypoxia can be classified as generalized or localized, depending on the extent of the affected area.\n\n### Generalized hypoxia\n\nGeneralized hypoxia occurs when the entire body is deprived of adequate oxygen supply. This can be caused by high altitude, anemia, or respiratory or cardiovascular disease.\n\n### Localized hypoxia\n\nLocalized hypoxia occurs when a specific region of the body is deprived of adequate oxygen supply. This can be caused by a blockage in a blood vessel, such as a stroke or heart attack.\n\n### By affected tissues and organs\n\nHypoxia can affect various tissues and organs, including the brain, heart, and kidneys.\n\n#### Cerebral hypoxia\n\nCerebral hypoxia occurs when the brain is deprived of adequate oxygen supply. This can be caused by a stroke, head injury, or high altitude.\n\n#### Corneal hypoxia\n\nCorneal hypoxia occurs when the cornea is deprived of adequate oxygen supply. This can be caused by contact lens use or other conditions that affect the cornea.\n\n#### Intrauterine hypoxia\n\nIntrauterine hypoxia occurs when a fetus is deprived of adequate oxygen supply in the womb. This can be caused by placental insufficiency or other conditions that affect the placenta.\n\n#### Tumor hypoxia\n\nTumor hypoxia occurs when a tumor is deprived of adequate oxygen supply. This can be caused by the rapid growth of the tumor, which can outstrip the supply of oxygen.\n\n#### Vestibular system\n\nHypoxia can also affect the vestibular system, which is responsible for balance and equilibrium.\n\nSigns and symptoms\n------------------\n\nThe signs and symptoms of hypoxia can vary depending on the severity and duration of the condition. Common symptoms include:\n\n* Shortness of breath\n* Fatigue\n* Headache\n* Dizziness\n* Confusion\n* Nausea and vomiting\n\n### Complications\n\nHypoxia can lead to a variety of complications, including:\n\n* Organ damage\n* Respiratory failure\n* Cardiac arrest\n* Stroke\n* Coma\n\nCauses\n------\n\nHypoxia can be caused by a variety of factors, including ischemia, hypoxemic hypoxia, anemia, and histotoxic hypoxia.\n\n### Ischemia\n\nIschemia occurs when a blockage in a blood vessel reduces blood flow to a specific region of the body. This can be caused by a blood clot, atherosclerosis, or other conditions that affect the blood vessels.\n\n### Hypoxemic hypoxia\n\nHypoxemic hypoxia occurs when the blood is deprived of adequate oxygen supply. This can be caused by high altitude, anemia, or respiratory or cardiovascular disease.\n\n#### Carbon monoxide poisoning\n\nCarbon monoxide poisoning can cause hypoxemic hypoxia by binding to hemoglobin in the blood and reducing the amount of oxygen that can be carried to the body's tissues.\n\n#### Altitude\n\nHigh altitude can cause hypoxemic hypoxia by reducing the amount of oxygen in the air. This can be a problem for people who travel to high-altitude areas, such as mountain climbers.\n\n#### Hypoxic breathing gases\n\nHypoxic breathing gases can cause hypoxemic hypoxia by reducing the amount of oxygen in the air. This can be a problem for people who work with gases, such as welders or firefighters.\n\n#### Other\n\nOther causes of hypoxemic hypoxia include anemia, respiratory or cardiovascular disease, and sleep apnea.\n\n### Anemia\n\nAnemia occurs when the body does not have enough red blood cells or hemoglobin. This can be caused by a variety of factors, including iron deficiency, vitamin deficiency, or chronic disease.\n\n### Histotoxic hypoxia\n\nHistotoxic hypoxia occurs when the body's tissues are poisoned by toxins, such as cyanide or carbon monoxide. This can be caused by exposure to toxic substances or by certain medical conditions.\n\nMechanism\n----------\n\nThe mechanism of hypoxia involves a complex interplay between the body's tissues, the blood, and the lungs.\n\n### Physiological responses\n\nThe body's physiological responses to hypoxia include:\n\n* Increased breathing rate\n* Increased heart rate\n* Increased blood pressure\n* Increased production of red blood cells\n* Increased production of hemoglobin\n\n### Acute\n\nAcute hypoxia can cause a variety of symptoms, including shortness of breath, fatigue, and headache.\n\n### Chronic\n\nChronic hypoxia can cause a variety of symptoms, including fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath.\n\n### Pathological responses\n\nPathological responses to hypoxia include:\n\n* Organ damage\n* Respiratory failure\n* Cardiac arrest\n* Stroke\n* Coma\n\n#### Cerebral ischemia\n\nCerebral ischemia occurs when the brain is deprived of adequate oxygen supply. This can be caused by a stroke, head injury, or high altitude.\n\n#### Myocardial ischemia\n\nMyocardial ischemia occurs when the heart is deprived of adequate oxygen supply. This can be caused by a heart attack, angina, or other conditions that affect the heart.\n\n#### Tumor angiogenesis\n\nTumor angiogenesis occurs when a tumor grows new blood vessels to supply itself with oxygen and nutrients. This can be a problem for cancer patients, as it can help the tumor to grow and spread.\n\nDiagnosis\n----------\n\nDiagnosis of hypoxia typically involves a combination of physical examination, medical history, and laboratory tests.\n\n### Physical examination and history\n\nA physical examination and medical history can help to identify symptoms and risk factors for hypoxia.\n\n### Tests\n\nLaboratory tests that may be used to diagnose hypoxia include:\n\n* Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis\n* Pulse oximetry\n* Complete blood count (CBC)\n* Electrocardiogram (ECG)\n\n### Differential diagnosis\n\nDifferential diagnosis of hypoxia may include other conditions that cause similar symptoms, such as:\n\n* Anemia\n* Asthma\n* Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\n* Heart failure\n\nPrevention\n----------\n\nPrevention of hypoxia typically involves addressing underlying risk factors and taking steps to improve oxygen supply.\n\n### Prevention of altitude induced hypoxia\n\nPrevention of altitude-induced hypoxia typically involves:\n\n* Gradual ascent to high altitude\n* Acclimatization to high altitude\n* Use of supplemental oxygen\n* Avoidance of strenuous activity at high altitude\n\nTreatment and management\n-------------------------\n\nTreatment and management of hypoxia typically involve addressing underlying causes and improving oxygen supply.\n\n### Treatment of acute and chronic cases\n\nTreatment of acute hypoxia typically involves:\n\n* Supplemental oxygen therapy\n* Mechanical ventilation\n* Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)\n* Medications to improve oxygen supply\n\nTreatment of chronic hypoxia typically involves:\n\n* Long-term supplemental oxygen therapy\n* Pulmonary rehabilitation\n* Medications to improve oxygen supply\n\nOutcomes\n---------\n\nOutcomes of hypoxia can vary depending on the severity and duration of the condition.

The film is a re-imagining of the 1940 Disney animated film of the same name, which was based on the 1881 Italian novel \"The Adventures of Pinocchio\" by Carlo Collodi. The film stars Tom Hanks as Geppetto, a poor woodcarver who creates a puppet that comes to life, and Benjamin Evan Ainsworth as the voice of Pinocchio, the titular character.\n\n#Plot\n\nThe film begins in a small Italian village where Geppetto, a poor but kind woodcarver, lives. Geppetto has lost his wife and son in a tragic accident and is struggling to cope with the loss. One day, he creates a puppet from a magical piece of wood and wishes upon a star for the puppet to become a real boy. To his surprise, the puppet comes to life, and Geppetto names him Pinocchio.\n\nPinocchio is a mischievous and curious puppet who is prone to telling lies. Every time he tells a lie, his nose grows longer, causing trouble and embarrassment. Geppetto tries to teach Pinocchio the importance of honesty and responsibility, but the puppet's antics often land him in trouble.\n\nAs Pinocchio navigates the world, he encounters a cast of characters, including Stromboli, a greedy puppeteer; Honest John, a sly fox; and the Blue Fairy, a wise and kind spirit who serves as Pinocchio's guide. Along the way, Pinocchio learns valuable lessons about the consequences of his actions and the importance of being truthful.\n\n#Cast\n\n* Tom Hanks as Geppetto\n* Benjamin Evan Ainsworth as the voice of Pinocchio\n* Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the voice of Jiminy Cricket\n* Keegan-Michael Key as the voice of Honest John\n* Lorraine Bracco as the voice of Sofia the Seagull\n* Giuseppe Battiston as Stromboli\n* Cynthia Erivo as the Blue Fairy\n\n#Production\n\n##Development\n\nThe film was first announced in 2015, with Robert Zemeckis attached to direct and write the screenplay.

Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Keegan-Michael Key, and Lorraine Bracco were also cast in voice roles, while Giuseppe Battiston and Cynthia Erivo were cast in live-action roles.\n\n##Filming\n\nPrincipal photography began in March 2021 and took place in Italy and the United Kingdom. The film was shot on location in various Italian cities, including Rome, Florence, and Venice. Additional filming took place at Pinewood Studios in London.\n\n##Visual effects and animation\n\nThe film's visual effects were created by MPC and Digital Domain, with Andrew Barrer serving as the visual effects supervisor.

The score was performed by the London Symphony Orchestra and features a mix of traditional and contemporary instruments. The film also features several original songs, including \"When You Wish Upon a Star,\" which was written by Ned Washington and Leigh Harline for the 1940 Disney animated film.\n\n#Marketing\n\nThe film's marketing campaign began in 2022, with the release of the first trailer in February.
