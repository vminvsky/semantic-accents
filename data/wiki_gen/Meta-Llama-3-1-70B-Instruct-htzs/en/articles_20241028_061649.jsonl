The incursions began on May 22, 2023, and continued sporadically until December 2023, resulting in significant military and civilian casualties, as well as a humanitarian crisis.\n\n# Background\n\nThe Belgorod Oblast incursions occurred in the context of the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, which began in February 2022. The region of Belgorod Oblast shares a 280-kilometer border with Ukraine's Kharkiv and Sumy Oblasts, making it a sensitive area for both Russian and Ukrainian forces. The region has been subject to periodic shelling and cross-border attacks since the start of the conflict.\n\n# First Raid\n\n## 22 May\n\nOn May 22, 2023, a group of pro-Ukrainian forces, reportedly comprising Ukrainian nationals and foreign fighters, launched a surprise attack on the village of Grayvoron, which is located approximately 10 kilometers from the Ukrainian border. The attackers, estimated to be around 100-200 in number, were equipped with small arms, mortars, and armored vehicles.\n\n## 23 May\n\nThe attack on Grayvoron was followed by a larger incursion on May 23, as pro-Ukrainian forces advanced deeper into Russian territory, targeting the towns of Novaya Tavolzhanka and Nezhegol. The Russian military responded with force, deploying troops and artillery to engage the attackers.\n\n## Aftermath\n\nThe first raid resulted in significant casualties on both sides, with Russian officials reporting at least 10 soldiers killed and over 20 wounded. Pro-Ukrainian forces also suffered losses, although the exact number is unknown. The incursion caused widespread destruction and displacement of civilians, with many residents fleeing the area for safer regions.\n\n# Second Raid\n\n## 1–3 June\n\nOn June 1, 2023, pro-Ukrainian forces launched a second incursion into Belgorod Oblast, targeting the town of Suzemka. The attack was reportedly carried out by a larger group of fighters, estimated to be around 500-600 in number. The Russian military responded with airstrikes and artillery fire, attempting to dislodge the attackers.\n\n## 4 June – 15 June\n\nThe second raid continued for several days, with pro-Ukrainian forces attempting to consolidate their gains and Russian forces seeking to regain control of the area. The fighting resulted in significant casualties and damage to infrastructure, including the destruction of several bridges and roads.\n\n# Sporadic Incursions (June–December 2023)\n\nFollowing the second raid, pro-Ukrainian forces continued to conduct sporadic incursions into Belgorod Oblast, targeting Russian military positions and civilians. The incursions were often carried out by small groups of fighters, who would launch surprise attacks before retreating back into Ukraine.\n\n# Casualties and Losses\n\n## Pro-Ukrainian Forces\n\nThe exact number of casualties suffered by pro-Ukrainian forces during the Belgorod Oblast incursions is unknown. However, it is estimated that several hundred fighters were killed or wounded during the raids.\n\n## Russian Government Forces\n\nRussian officials reported at least 50 soldiers killed and over 100 wounded during the incursions. The Russian military also suffered significant losses in terms of equipment and infrastructure.\n\n# Humanitarian Impact and Evacuations\n\nThe Belgorod Oblast incursions had a significant humanitarian impact, with thousands of civilians displaced or affected by the fighting. Many residents were forced to flee the area, seeking shelter in safer regions. The Russian government established several evacuation centers to accommodate displaced persons, providing food, shelter, and medical assistance.\n\n# Analysis\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe motivation behind the Belgorod Oblast incursions is unclear. However, it is believed that pro-Ukrainian forces sought to disrupt Russian military operations in the region and create a diversion from the main conflict zone in eastern Ukraine.\n\n## Ukrainian Involvement\n\nThe extent of Ukrainian involvement in the incursions is disputed. While Ukrainian officials denied any direct involvement, it is believed that Ukrainian forces provided logistical and intelligence support to pro-Ukrainian fighters.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## Ukraine\n\nUkrainian officials denied any direct involvement in the incursions, describing them as \"local uprisings\" against Russian rule. However, some Ukrainian politicians and commentators praised the actions of pro-Ukrainian forces, viewing them as a legitimate response to Russian aggression.\n\n## Russia\n\nRussian officials condemned the incursions as \"terrorist attacks\" and vowed to take decisive action against those responsible. The Russian government also accused Ukraine of supporting and financing the incursions, which Ukraine denied.\n\n## United States\n\nThe United States condemned the incursions, calling for a de-escalation of tensions and a return to diplomacy. The US also provided humanitarian assistance to affected civilians and supported efforts to investigate the incursions and hold those responsible accountable.\n\n# See Also\n\n* Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* War in Donbas\n* Ukrainian-Russian border conflicts\n\n# Notes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Belgorod_Oblast_incursions\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#First raid\n##22 May\n##23 May\n##Aftermath\n#Second raid\n##1–3 June\n##4 June – 15 June\n#Sporadic incursions (June–December 2023)\n#Casualties and losses\n##Pro-Ukrainian forces\n##Russian government forces\n#Humanitarian impact and evacuations\n#Analysis\n##Motivation\n##Ukrainian involvement\n#Reactions\n##Ukraine\n##Russia\n##United States\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Oz and McCormick engaged in a series of negative ads, with each candidate attempting to portray the other as insufficiently conservative. Meanwhile, other candidates, such as Kathy Barnette and Jeff Bartos, sought to capitalize on their grassroots support and appeal to voters who were skeptical of the leading candidates.\n\n## Candidates\n\n### Nominee\n\n* Mehmet Oz, cardiothoracic surgeon and television personality\n\n### Eliminated in primary\n\n* Kathy Barnette, conservative commentator and activist\n* Jeff Bartos, real estate developer and businessman\n* George Bochetto, lawyer and businessman\n* Sean Gale, businessman and entrepreneur\n* David McCormick, former hedge fund manager and businessman\n* Carla Sands, businesswoman and diplomat\n* Everett Stern, businessman and activist\n\n### Disqualified\n\n* Martin Rosenfeld, businessman and entrepreneur (disqualified due to petition signature issues)\n\n### Withdrew\n\n* Sean Parnell, author and businessman (withdrew due to allegations of domestic abuse)\n\n### Declined\n\n* Ryan Costello, former U.S. Representative (declined to run)\n* Tom Marino, former U.S. Representative (declined to run)\n* Guy Reschenthaler, U.S. Representative (declined to run)\n\n## Debates and forums\n\nSeveral debates and forums were held during the Republican primary campaign, featuring the leading candidates.

It is considered one of the deadliest train crashes in Greek history, resulting in widespread outrage, protests, and a thorough investigation into the circumstances surrounding the tragedy.\n\n# Background\n\nGreece's rail network has faced criticism for years due to inadequate infrastructure, insufficient funding, and concerns over safety standards. The Tempi Valley, where the accident occurred, is a notorious stretch of rail line known for its sharp curves, steep grades, and limited visibility. The section of track where the crash happened is a single line, meaning trains traveling in opposite directions must use the same track, increasing the risk of head-on collisions.\n\nThe train involved in the crash, a passenger train operated by Hellenic Train, was traveling from Athens to Thessaloniki, Greece's second-largest city. The train was carrying 350 passengers, many of whom were students returning from a carnival celebration. The train was scheduled to arrive in Thessaloniki at 11:30 PM local time.\n\n# Collision\n\nAt approximately 11:20 PM, the passenger train collided head-on with a freight train traveling in the opposite direction. The freight train, carrying cargo from Thessaloniki to Larissa, had been given permission to use the single track section of rail line despite safety protocols prohibiting such maneuvers.\n\nThe force of the impact was catastrophic, with the passenger train's cars crumpling and bursting into flames. The crash occurred near the town of Tempi, and local residents quickly alerted emergency services. Rescue teams arrived on the scene, but their efforts were hindered by the remote location, lack of access roads, and the severity of the damage.\n\n# Victims\n\nThe Tempi train crash resulted in the loss of 57 lives, with over 80 injured, many critically. The victims included students, commuters, and railway staff. The youngest victim was a 17-year-old high school student, while the oldest was a 64-year-old retiree. The crash also left many families without loved ones, with some victims' bodies taking days to identify due to the severity of the damage.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe crash sparked widespread outrage and grief across Greece, with many calling for immediate action to address the country's rail safety issues. The Greek government declared three days of national mourning, and flags were flown at half-mast across the country.\n\nRescue efforts continued for several days, with emergency responders working tirelessly to locate and recover victims. The site of the crash was eventually cleared, and the damaged rail line was repaired.\n\n# Investigation\n\nAn investigation into the crash was launched immediately, with the Greek Transport Ministry, the Hellenic Train company, and the European Railway Agency (ERA) all participating. Preliminary findings suggested that human error and inadequate safety protocols contributed to the disaster.\n\nThe investigation focused on several key factors, including the decision to allow the freight train to use the single track section of rail line, the lack of adequate safety measures, and the state of the rail infrastructure. The inquiry also examined the potential role of understaffing, inadequate training, and insufficient resources.\n\n# Reactions\n\nThe Tempi train crash sparked a wave of reactions, from protests and demonstrations to calls for resignations and demands for improved rail safety.\n\n## Protests\n\nProtests erupted across Greece, with thousands taking to the streets to demand justice and improved rail safety. Demonstrations were held in major cities, including Athens, Thessaloniki, and Larissa, with protesters chanting slogans and holding banners.\n\n## Collection of signatures\n\nA petition calling for improved rail safety and accountability was launched, gathering thousands of signatures within days. The petition was presented to the Greek government, which pledged to take immediate action to address the country's rail safety issues.\n\n## Documentaries\n\nSeveral documentaries and investigative reports were produced in the aftermath of the crash, examining the circumstances surrounding the tragedy and the state of Greece's rail network. The documentaries highlighted the need for improved safety measures, increased funding, and greater accountability.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of rail accidents in Greece\n* Rail transport in Greece\n* Hellenic Train\n* European Railway Agency", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Tempi_train_crash\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Collision\n#Victims\n#Aftermath\n#Investigation\n#Reactions\n##Protests\n##Collection of signatures\n##Documentaries\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

They invested heavily in various sectors, including steel, machinery, and electronics, and established several companies that would become cornerstones of the Swedish economy. One of the most notable companies founded by the Wallenbergs during this period was Electrolux, which would go on to become one of the world's leading manufacturers of household appliances.\n\n## World War II and the Post-War Period\n\nDuring World War II, the Wallenberg family's business interests were severely affected by the conflict. Many of their companies were forced to shut down or significantly reduce production due to the war effort. However, the family continued to play an important role in Swedish society, with several members serving in key government positions or working to support the war effort.\n\nIn the post-war period, the Wallenbergs continued to expand their business empire, investing in new sectors such as finance, telecoms, and biotechnology. They also became increasingly involved in philanthropy, establishing several foundations and charitable organizations to support education, healthcare, and the arts.\n\n# Modern Business\n\n## Holdings and Investments\n\nToday, the Wallenberg family's business interests are managed through a complex network of holding companies, foundations, and investment vehicles. The family's main holding company, Investor AB, is one of the largest and most influential investment companies in Sweden, with a portfolio that includes stakes in some of the country's most prominent companies, including Electrolux, Ericsson, and AstraZeneca.\n\nThe Wallenbergs also have significant investments in the financial sector, with stakes in several major banks and insurance companies. They are also active in the venture capital and private equity markets, investing in a range of sectors, including technology, healthcare, and renewable energy.\n\n## Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility\n\nThe Wallenberg family has a long tradition of commitment to social responsibility and sustainability. Many of their companies have implemented environmentally friendly and socially responsible practices, and the family has established several foundations and charitable organizations to support education, healthcare, and community development.\n\n## Innovation and Entrepreneurship\n\nThe Wallenbergs have a strong track record of innovation and entrepreneurship, with several family members launching successful start-ups or investing in new technologies. The family has also established several incubators and accelerators to support young entrepreneurs and start-ups, particularly in the tech and biotech sectors.\n\n# Notable Family Members\n\n## André Oscar Wallenberg\n\nAndré Oscar Wallenberg (1816-1886) was the founder of the Wallenberg family's business empire. He was a Swedish diplomat and businessman who established Stockholms Enskilda Bank in 1856.\n\n## Knut Wallenberg\n\nKnut Wallenberg (1853-1938) was the son of André Oscar Wallenberg and took over the family business after his father's death. He expanded the family's operations into various sectors and established several new companies.\n\n## Jacob Wallenberg\n\nJacob Wallenberg (1892-1980) was a Swedish businessman and diplomat who played a key role in the Wallenberg family's business empire during the mid-20th century. He served as the chairman of Investor AB and was a prominent figure in Swedish society.\n\n## Peter Wallenberg\n\nPeter Wallenberg (1926-2015) was a Swedish businessman and investor who was a key figure in the Wallenberg family's business empire during the late 20th century. He served as the chairman of Investor AB and was a prominent figure in Swedish society.\n\n## Jacob Wallenberg Jr.\n\nJacob Wallenberg Jr. (born 1956) is a Swedish businessman and investor who is the current chairman of Investor AB.

The tournament was held in Edmonton and Red Deer, Alberta, Canada, from December 26, 2021, to January 5, 2022.\n\n# Background\n\n## Preparations\n\nThe 2022 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships was originally awarded to the province of Alberta, Canada, in 2018. The tournament was set to be held in Edmonton and Red Deer, with the two cities serving as co-hosts. The event was expected to bring significant economic benefits to the region, with estimates suggesting that the tournament could generate up to CAD 50 million in revenue.\n\n## Cancellation and rescheduling of tournament due to COVID-19\n\nHowever, the COVID-19 pandemic forced the IIHF to re-evaluate the tournament schedule. In December 2021, the IIHF announced that the tournament would be cancelled due to concerns over the spread of the Omicron variant. The decision was made after several teams, including the United States and Czech Republic, withdrew from the tournament due to COVID-19 outbreaks within their squads.\n\nDespite the initial cancellation, the IIHF later announced that the tournament would be rescheduled for August 2022. However, the rescheduled tournament would feature a revised format, with the top eight teams from the original tournament competing in a round-robin group stage, followed by a knockout stage.\n\n## Sponsorship withdrawals and low attendance\n\nThe rescheduled tournament faced significant challenges, including sponsorship withdrawals and low attendance. Several major sponsors, including Telus and Esso, withdrew their support for the tournament due to concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe low attendance at the tournament was also a major concern, with several games played in front of near-empty arenas. The poor attendance was attributed to a combination of factors, including the rescheduled dates, which conflicted with other summer sporting events, and the lack of promotion for the tournament.\n\n## Group A (December 2021)\n\nThe original Group A consisted of Canada, Finland, Germany, and Czech Republic. However, the group was revised after the withdrawal of the Czech Republic and the rescheduling of the tournament.\n\n## Group B (December 2021)\n\nThe original Group B consisted of Russia, Sweden, United States, and Switzerland.

The teams were required to submit their rosters prior to the start of the tournament.\n\n## Teams\n\nThe Top Division tournament featured 10 teams, including the host Canada. The teams were divided into two groups, with the top teams from each group advancing to the knockout stage.\n\n## Preliminary round\n\n### Group A\n\nThe revised Group A consisted of Canada, Finland, and Germany.

Canada defeated Sweden 4-1, while the United States defeated Finland 3-2.\n\n### Bronze medal game\n\nThe bronze medal game featured the losers of the semifinals, with Finland winning the bronze medal with a 5-3 victory over the United States.\n\n### Final\n\nThe gold medal game featured the winners of the semifinals, with Canada winning the gold medal with a 4-3 victory over Sweden.\n\n## Statistics\n\n### Scoring leaders\n\nThe top scorer in the tournament was Connor Bedard of Canada, who scored 17 points in seven games.\n\n### Goaltending leaders\n\nThe top goaltender in the tournament was Jesper Wallstedt of Sweden, who recorded a 1.98 goals-against average in six games.\n\n## Awards\n\nThe IIHF presented several awards at the conclusion of the tournament.

It is the sixth installment in the Scream franchise and serves as a direct sequel to Scream (2022). The film follows a new group of characters as they are stalked by a mysterious killer, while also exploring the aftermath of the events of the previous film.\n\n#Plot\n\nThe film takes place in New York City, where a new Ghostface killer has emerged, targeting a group of friends who are connected to the original Woodsboro murders. The story follows Sam Carpenter (Melissa Barrera), Mindy Meeks-Martin (Jasmin Savoy Brown), and Chad Meeks-Martin (Mason Gooding) as they navigate their lives in the city, only to find themselves being stalked by the killer. As the bodies begin to pile up, the group must work together to uncover the identity of the killer and put an end to the violence.\n\nMeanwhile, the film also explores the theme of trauma and the lasting impact of the events of the previous film on the characters. Sam, in particular, is struggling to come to terms with her past and the weight of her family's legacy. As the story unfolds, the film pays homage to the original Scream while also introducing new themes and characters to the franchise.\n\n#Cast\n\nThe film features a diverse cast of characters, including:\n\n* Melissa Barrera as Sam Carpenter\n* Jasmin Savoy Brown as Mindy Meeks-Martin\n* Mason Gooding as Chad Meeks-Martin\n* Jenna Ortega as Tara Carpenter\n* Hayden Panettiere as Kirby Reed\n* Courteney Cox as Gale Weathers\n* Dermot Mulroney as Detective Wayne Bailey\n* Liana Liberato as Quinn Bailey\n* Jack Champion as Ethan Landry\n* Devyn Nekoda as Anika Kayoko\n* Josh Segarra as Danny Brackett\n\n#Production\n\n##Development\n\nThe development of Scream VI began shortly after the release of Scream (2022).

The film's story was influenced by the events of the previous film, as well as the current state of the world.\n\n\"We wanted to explore the idea of trauma and how it affects people in different ways,\" said Bettinelli-Olpin. \"We also wanted to pay homage to the original Scream while introducing new themes and characters to the franchise.\"\n\n##Casting\n\nThe casting process for Scream VI was a long and arduous one. The film's directors had a clear idea of who they wanted to cast in each role, and they worked closely with the studio to bring their vision to life.\n\n###Neve Campbell's involvement\n\nNeve Campbell, who played the iconic role of Sidney Prescott in the original Scream franchise, was approached by the studio to return for Scream VI. However, due to a salary dispute, Campbell ultimately declined to participate in the film.\n\n\"I'm disappointed that Neve won't be a part of the film,\" said Bettinelli-Olpin. \"But we understand her decision and wish her all the best.\"\n\n##Filming\n\nPrincipal photography for Scream VI took place in Montreal, Canada, and New York City. The film's directors worked closely with the cast and crew to bring the story to life, using a combination of practical and CGI effects to create the film's iconic kills.\n\n\"We wanted to make sure that the film's kills were both shocking and memorable,\" said Gillett. \"We worked closely with the special effects team to create some truly iconic moments.\"\n\n#Music\n\nThe film's score was composed by Brian Tyler, who has worked on numerous horror films in the past.

The campaign focused on the film's kills, as well as its themes of trauma and legacy.\n\n\"We wanted to make sure that the marketing campaign would both excite and terrify audiences,\" said Bettinelli-Olpin. \"We think we've accomplished that with our trailers and TV spots.\"\n\n##Home media\n\nScream VI was released on DVD and Blu-ray in May 2023, with numerous special features and behind-the-scenes footage.\n\n\"We're thrilled to bring Scream VI to home media,\" said Gillett. \"We think fans of the franchise will love the special features and behind-the-scenes footage.\"\n\n#Reception\n\n##Box office\n\nScream VI was a commercial success, grossing over $100 million at the domestic box office and over $200 million worldwide.\n\n\"We're thrilled with the film's box office performance,\" said Bettinelli-Olpin. \"We think it's a testament to the enduring popularity of the Scream franchise.\"\n\n##Critical response\n\nScream VI received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising the film's kills and themes, while others found it to be too formulaic.\n\n\"Scream VI is a fun and frightening addition to the franchise,\" said Rolling Stone. \"However, it also feels overly familiar and formulaic at times.\"\n\n##Accolades\n\nScream VI won several awards at the 2023 FrightFest Awards, including Best Horror Film and Best Kill.\n\n\"We're thrilled to have won these awards,\" said Bettinelli-Olpin. \"We think it's a testament to the film's quality and the hard work of our cast and crew.\"\n\n#Sequel\n\nA sequel to Scream VI is currently in development, with the film's directors and writers set to return.\n\n\"We're excited to continue the story of Scream VI,\" said Gillett. \"We think there are still many stories to be told in the Scream universe.\"\n\n#Notes\n\n* Scream VI is the first film in the franchise to be set in New York City.\n* The film's script was influenced by the events of the previous film, as well as the current state of the world.\n* The film's directors worked closely with the cast and crew to bring the story to life, using a combination of practical and CGI effects to create the film's iconic kills.\n\n#References\n\n* None\n\n#External links\n\n* Scream VI on IMDb\n* Scream VI on Rotten Tomatoes\n* Scream VI on Metacritic", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Scream_VI\" following this outline:\n\n#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production\n##Development\n##Casting\n###Neve Campbell's involvement\n##Filming\n#Music\n#Release\n##Marketing\n##Home media\n#Reception\n##Box office\n##Critical response\n##Accolades\n#Sequel\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

As a prominent figure in the Romanian Communist Party, Rădulescu's life and career were marked by periods of rise and fall, ultimately ending in tragic circumstances.\n\n# Biography\n\n## Early life and FSD\n\nGogu Rădulescu was born on February 5, 1914, in the town of Drăgășani, Vâlcea County, Romania. His early life was marked by a strong interest in literature and poetry, which would eventually become a defining aspect of his career. Rădulescu's family was part of the local intelligentsia, and his parents encouraged his love for learning and the arts.\n\nRădulescu's involvement in politics began at a young age, as he joined the Romanian Communist Party's youth wing, the Union of Communist Youth (UTC), in the early 1930s. During this period, he became acquainted with various left-wing ideologies and began to develop his own Marxist-Leninist views. In 1934, Rădulescu became a member of the Romanian Communist Party (PCR) itself, which would remain his primary affiliation for the rest of his life.\n\n## Wartime desertion and return\n\nDuring World War II, Rădulescu was drafted into the Romanian Army, which was allied with the Axis powers at the time. However, in 1943, he deserted and joined the partisan movement, fighting against the fascist regime. This decision would later be celebrated as a heroic act of defiance against the fascist authorities.\n\nAfter the war, Rădulescu returned to politics, becoming a prominent figure in the PCR's cultural department. He began to establish himself as a poet and writer, publishing his first collection of poems, \"The Red Plow,\" in 1945. Rădulescu's literary work was characterized by its strong socialist realism and patriotic themes, which resonated with the communist authorities.\n\n## 1952 fall and 1956 recovery\n\nIn 1952, Rădulescu's career suffered a significant setback when he was accused of \"deviationism\" and \"bourgeois nationalism\" by the PCR leadership. This led to his expulsion from the party and a period of forced exile in the countryside. However, Rădulescu continued to write and publish his work, albeit in limited quantities.\n\nIn 1956, following the death of Stalin and the beginning of de-Stalinization in Eastern Europe, Rădulescu was rehabilitated and allowed to rejoin the PCR. He quickly regained his position as a prominent cultural figure and began to play a key role in shaping the party's cultural policies.\n\n## With Ceaușescu\n\nRădulescu's fortunes changed dramatically with the rise of Nicolae Ceaușescu to power in 1965. Ceaușescu, who would become one of the most notorious dictators in Eastern European history, saw Rădulescu as a valuable ally and appointed him as the Minister of Culture in 1967.\n\nDuring his tenure, Rădulescu implemented a series of cultural reforms aimed at promoting Romanian nationalism and socialism. He also became a key figure in the development of the PCR's ideology, advocating for a more liberal and tolerant approach to cultural expression.\n\n## Patronage and liberalism\n\nAs Minister of Culture, Rădulescu became a patron to many young writers and artists, providing them with support and encouragement. He also played a key role in promoting Romanian culture abroad, establishing cultural exchange programs with other socialist countries.\n\nRădulescu's liberal approach to cultural policy was reflected in his support for avant-garde and experimental art. He encouraged the development of new forms of artistic expression, including abstract painting and avant-garde music.\n\n## Protochronism and austerity debates\n\nHowever, Rădulescu's tenure was also marked by controversy, particularly surrounding the issue of \"protochronism.\" Protochronism was a doctrine that emphasized the primacy of Romanian culture and its supposed superiority over other cultures. Rădulescu was a key proponent of protochronism, which he saw as a way to promote Romanian nationalism and self-confidence.\n\nHowever, protochronism was also criticized for its chauvinistic and xenophobic undertones. Many intellectuals saw it as a form of cultural isolationism, which would stifle creativity and innovation.\n\nRădulescu was also involved in debates surrounding economic austerity. As the Romanian economy began to stagnate in the 1970s, Rădulescu advocated for a more liberal approach to economic policy, which would allow for greater freedom of enterprise and innovation.\n\n## Downfall, prosecution, and death\n\nRădulescu's fall from power began in the early 1980s, as Ceaușescu's regime became increasingly authoritarian and repressive. Rădulescu's liberal views and his advocacy for greater cultural freedom were seen as a threat to the regime's stability.\n\nIn 1983, Rădulescu was removed from his position as Minister of Culture and placed under house arrest. He was later charged with \"economic sabotage\" and \"treason,\" and was sentenced to 20 years in prison.\n\nRădulescu died in prison on December 21, 1991, at the age of 77. His death was a tragic consequence of the brutal repression and persecution that characterized Ceaușescu's regime.\n\n# Legacy\n\nGogu Rădulescu's legacy is complex and multifaceted. As a poet and writer, he played a significant role in shaping Romanian literature and culture. As a politician, he was a key figure in the development of the PCR's ideology and cultural policies.\n\nHowever, Rădulescu's legacy is also marked by controversy and tragedy. His involvement in the protochronist movement and his role in promoting Ceaușescu's regime have been widely criticized.\n\nDespite these controversies, Rădulescu remains an important figure in Romanian cultural and political history. His life and career serve as a reminder of the complexities and challenges of living under a totalitarian regime, and the importance of promoting cultural freedom and creativity.\n\n# Notes\n\n* This article is a general overview of Gogu Rădulescu's life and career.

This article provides a comprehensive chronology of the later Crusades, spanning the 13th to 15th centuries.\n\n**Chronologies of the Crusades in print**\n\nHistorians have attempted to compile comprehensive chronologies of the Crusades since the 19th century. One of the earliest and most influential works is the \"History of the Crusades\" by French historian Joseph François Michaud, published in 1812. Michaud's work sets the standard for subsequent chronologies, including the influential \"A History of the Crusades\" by Sir Steven Runciman, published in 1951. More recent works, such as Malcolm Lambert's \"The Crusades: Islam and the West\" (2002), continue to refine our understanding of this complex period.\n\n**13th century**\n\nThe 13th century saw a series of significant events that shaped the course of the Crusades.\n\n### Prior events\n\nThe 13th century began with the Fourth Crusade (1202-1204), which saw the capture of Constantinople by Latin forces. This event had far-reaching consequences, including the establishment of the Latin Empire and the weakening of the Byzantine Empire. The Fifth Crusade (1213-1221) aimed to recapture Jerusalem but ultimately failed.\n\n### 1270\n\nIn 1270, King Louis IX of France launched the Eighth Crusade, which aimed to capture Tunis and convert the Hafsid sultan to Christianity. The crusade ended in disaster, with Louis IX dying of dysentery in August 1270.\n\n### 1280\n\nThe Ninth Crusade (1271-1272) saw Prince Edward of England, later King Edward I, arrive in the Holy Land. Although the crusade achieved some minor victories, it ultimately failed to achieve its objectives.\n\n### 1290\n\nIn 1290, the Mamluk sultan Qalawun launched a successful campaign against the remaining Crusader strongholds in the Holy Land, capturing Acre and driving the Crusaders out of the region.\n\n**14th century**\n\nThe 14th century saw a series of smaller, more localized crusades.\n\n### 1300\n\nIn 1300, Pope Boniface VIII called for a crusade against the Ottoman Empire, but the effort ultimately failed to materialize.\n\n### 1310\n\nThe Hospitaller Knights, a military order founded during the First Crusade, launched a successful campaign against the Ottoman Empire in 1310, capturing the island of Rhodes.\n\n### 1320\n\nThe Ottomans, led by Orhan I, launched a successful campaign against the Byzantine Empire in 1320, capturing the city of Bursa.\n\n### 1330\n\nIn 1330, the Knights Templar, another military order, were accused of heresy and disbanded. Many of its members were arrested and executed.\n\n### 1340\n\nThe Crusade of Smyrna (1343-1344) saw a coalition of European powers, including the Knights Hospitaller and the Republic of Venice, launch a successful campaign against the Ottoman Empire, capturing the city of Smyrna.\n\n### 1350\n\nIn 1350, the Black Death, a pandemic that ravaged Europe, led to a decline in crusading enthusiasm.\n\n### 1360\n\nThe Ottomans, led by Murad I, launched a successful campaign against the Byzantine Empire in 1360, capturing the city of Adrianople.\n\n### 1370\n\nIn 1370, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, a pagan state, launched a successful campaign against the Teutonic Knights, a military order founded during the 13th century.\n\n### 1380\n\nThe Ottomans, led by Murad I, launched a successful campaign against the Serbian Empire in 1380, capturing the city of Kosovo.\n\n### 1390\n\nIn 1390, the Ottomans, led by Bayezid I, launched a successful campaign against the Bulgarian Empire, capturing the city of Sofia.\n\n**15th century**\n\nThe 15th century saw the rise of the Ottoman Empire and the eventual fall of Constantinople.\n\n### 1400\n\nIn 1400, the Ottoman Empire, led by Bayezid I, launched a successful campaign against the Byzantine Empire, besieging the city of Constantinople. Although the siege ultimately failed, it marked the beginning of the end of the Byzantine Empire.\n\n**References**\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Chronology_of_the_later_Crusades_through_1400\" following this outline:\n\n#Chronologies of the Crusades in print\n#13th century\n##Prior events\n##1270\n##1280\n##1290\n#14th century\n##1300\n##1310\n##1320\n##1330\n##1340\n##1350\n##1360\n##1370\n##1380\n##1390\n#15th century\n##1400\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The queue was one of the longest and most notable in British history, with thousands of people waiting for hours, and in some cases, overnight, to view the Queen's coffin at Westminster Hall in London.\n\n#Precedents\n\nThe lying-in-state of Elizabeth II was not the first time a British monarch had been given a similar tribute. In 1901, thousands of people queued to pay their respects to Queen Victoria, who had died on January 22 of that year. Similarly, in 1952, a large crowd gathered to pay their respects to King George VI, who had died on February 6 of that year. However, the queue for Elizabeth II's lying-in-state was significantly longer and more extensive than any previous queue for a British monarch.\n\n#Routes\n\nThe queue for the lying-in-state of Elizabeth II was divided into two main routes: the main queue and the accessible queue.\n\n##Main queue\n\nThe main queue began at Victoria Tower Gardens, located near the Houses of Parliament, and wound its way along the south bank of the River Thames, passing by several notable landmarks, including the Tower of London and Tower Bridge. The queue then turned north and passed through several streets in central London, including Whitehall and Parliament Square, before finally arriving at Westminster Hall.\n\n##Accessible queue\n\nThe accessible queue was designed for people with disabilities or mobility issues. This queue was significantly shorter than the main queue and began at a designated accessible entry point near Westminster Hall. From there, people in the accessible queue were able to join the main queue, but were given priority access to the hall.\n\n#Length\n\nThe queue for the lying-in-state of Elizabeth II was incredibly long, with estimates suggesting that it stretched for over 5 miles (8 kilometers) at its peak. The queue was so long that it took many people over 24 hours to reach the front and pay their respects to the Queen. Despite the length of the queue, many people were willing to wait, with some even camping out overnight to secure a spot.\n\n#Organisation\n\nThe queue for the lying-in-state of Elizabeth II was carefully organized by the British authorities, with a large team of police officers, stewards, and volunteers working to ensure the queue ran smoothly. The queue was divided into sections, each with its own designated entry point and exit point. People in the queue were given a wristband with a unique number on it, which was used to track their progress through the queue.\n\n##Exemptions from queuing\n\nCertain individuals were exempt from queuing, including members of the royal family, politicians, and dignitaries. These individuals were given priority access to the hall and were able to pay their respects to the Queen without having to wait in line.\n\n#Participation and incidents\n\nDespite the length of the queue, many people were willing to participate and wait to pay their respects to the Queen. However, there were some incidents reported, including people fainting due to the heat and exhaustion, and some individuals becoming aggressive or disorderly. In response to these incidents, the authorities increased the number of police officers and stewards on duty, and also provided additional amenities, such as food and water, to people in the queue.\n\n#Responses and media coverage\n\nThe queue for the lying-in-state of Elizabeth II received widespread media coverage, with many news outlets reporting on the length of the queue and the dedication of the people waiting to pay their respects to the Queen. The queue was also the subject of much commentary and analysis, with many people praising the British public for their dignity and respect in the face of adversity.\n\n#External links\n\n(Note: This section would typically include links to external websites or sources, but as per the requirements, it will be left blank.)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Queue_for_the_lying-in-state_of_Elizabeth_II\" following this outline:\n\n#Precedents\n#Routes\n##Main queue\n##Accessible queue\n#Length\n#Organisation\n##Exemptions from queuing\n#Participation and incidents\n#Responses and media coverage\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Davis restructuring\n##Headquarters\n#See also\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Gulf and Western Industries\n==========================\n\nGulf and Western Industries was a large American conglomerate that operated from the 1930s to the 1980s. The company was involved in a diverse range of industries, including film and television production, publishing, manufacturing, and real estate. At its peak, Gulf and Western was one of the largest and most influential conglomerates in the United States.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### Bluhdorn period\n\nGulf and Western Industries was founded in the 1930s as a small manufacturing company. However, it was not until the 1950s, under the leadership of Charles Bluhdorn, that the company began to expand rapidly through a series of strategic acquisitions. Bluhdorn, a charismatic and ambitious executive, had a vision of building a diversified conglomerate that could compete with the largest companies in the United States.\n\nDuring the 1960s, Gulf and Western acquired several major companies, including the film studio Paramount Pictures, the publishing company Simon & Schuster, and the conglomerate Studebaker. These acquisitions gave Gulf and Western a significant presence in the entertainment, publishing, and manufacturing industries.\n\nBluhdorn's leadership style was characterized by a focus on growth and expansion. He was known for his aggressive acquisition strategy, which involved identifying undervalued companies and using Gulf and Western's resources to turn them around. Bluhdorn also believed in decentralizing decision-making, giving his executives a high degree of autonomy to run their respective companies.\n\nUnder Bluhdorn's leadership, Gulf and Western experienced rapid growth and expansion. The company's revenues increased from $300 million in 1960 to over $10 billion in 1980. Gulf and Western also became known for its innovative approach to management, which emphasized flexibility, adaptability, and a focus on the bottom line.\n\n### Early 1980s\n\nIn the early 1980s, Gulf and Western began to face significant challenges. The company's rapid expansion had created a complex and unwieldy organizational structure, which made it difficult to manage and coordinate the various business units. Additionally, the economic downturn of the early 1980s had a significant impact on Gulf and Western's revenues and profitability.\n\nIn response to these challenges, Gulf and Western's new leadership, led by CEO Martin S. Davis, initiated a major restructuring effort. The goal of this effort was to simplify the company's organizational structure, reduce costs, and improve profitability.\n\n### Martin S. Davis restructuring\n\nMartin S. Davis, who had joined Gulf and Western as a young executive, was appointed CEO in 1983. Davis was known for his analytical approach to management, which emphasized the use of data and metrics to drive decision-making.\n\nUnder Davis's leadership, Gulf and Western underwent a major restructuring effort. The company sold off several non-core businesses, including its manufacturing and real estate operations. Davis also implemented a series of cost-cutting measures, including reducing the company's workforce and streamlining its operations.\n\nThe restructuring effort had a significant impact on Gulf and Western's financial performance. The company's revenues declined, but its profitability improved significantly. Gulf and Western also became more focused on its core businesses, including film and television production, publishing, and entertainment.\n\n### Headquarters\n\nGulf and Western's headquarters were located in New York City. The company's headquarters building, located in Midtown Manhattan, was a symbol of the company's power and influence. The building was designed by a prominent architectural firm and featured a sleek, modern design.\n\nHeadquarters was the nerve center of Gulf and Western's operations, housing the company's senior executives, including the CEO and CFO. The building also featured state-of-the-art facilities, including a large auditorium, conference rooms, and a sophisticated telecommunications system.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Paramount Pictures\n* Simon & Schuster\n* Studebaker\n* Charles Bluhdorn\n* Martin S.

The island has a rich and complex history spanning over 10,000 years, from the earliest prehistoric inhabitants to the present day. This article provides an overview of the major periods and events in Taiwan's history.\n\n# Prehistory\n\nThe earliest known human habitation in Taiwan dates back to the Paleolithic era, around 50,000 years ago. Archaeological evidence suggests that the island was inhabited by various indigenous tribes, including the Austronesian-speaking peoples, who are believed to have migrated from mainland China and Southeast Asia. These early inhabitants lived in small villages, subsisting on hunting, gathering, and fishing. The prehistoric period in Taiwan is characterized by the presence of several distinct cultural groups, including the Changbin culture, the Dapenkeng culture, and the Niumatou culture.\n\n# Chinese contact and settlement\n\nChinese contact with Taiwan dates back to the Han dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE), when Chinese fishermen and traders began to visit the island. However, it was not until the 13th century that Chinese settlement in Taiwan began in earnest. During the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368), Chinese immigrants from the Fujian province began to arrive in Taiwan, attracted by the island's fertile soil and abundant natural resources. These early Chinese settlers established small communities and began to cultivate the land, introducing new crops and farming techniques.\n\n## Dutch and Spanish colonies (1624–1668)\n\n### Contact and establishment\n\nIn 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a trading post on the island of Taiwan, which they named \"Formosa.\" The Dutch were attracted by the island's strategic location and its potential for trade with China and other Asian countries. The Spanish also established a presence on the island, with the arrival of a Spanish fleet in 1626.\n\n### Piracy\n\nDuring the early 17th century, Taiwan was a haven for pirates and privateers, who preyed on Chinese and Japanese shipping. The Dutch and Spanish attempted to suppress piracy, but it remained a significant problem throughout the colonial period.\n\n### Japanese trade\n\nIn the early 17th century, the Japanese also established trade relations with Taiwan, exchanging goods such as silk and porcelain for Taiwanese sugar and deer hides.\n\n### Spanish Formosa\n\nIn 1626, the Spanish established a colony on the northern coast of Taiwan, which they named \"Spanish Formosa.\" The Spanish colony was short-lived, however, and was eventually captured by the Dutch in 1642.\n\n### Dutch colonization\n\nThe Dutch colonization of Taiwan lasted from 1624 to 1662. During this period, the Dutch established a series of forts and trading posts, and encouraged Chinese settlement on the island. The Dutch also introduced Christianity, primarily Calvinism, to the island.\n\n### Chinese settlers\n\nChinese settlement in Taiwan increased significantly during the Dutch period, with many Chinese immigrants arriving from the Fujian province. The Chinese established their own communities and began to cultivate the land, introducing new crops and farming techniques.\n\n### End of Dutch rule\n\nIn 1662, the Dutch were expelled from Taiwan by the Chinese pirate-king Zheng Chenggong, also known as Koxinga. Zheng had established a base on the island and had been waging a campaign against the Dutch for several years.\n\n# Kingdom of Tungning (1661–1683)\n\n### Conquest\n\nIn 1662, Zheng Chenggong captured the Dutch fort of Zeelandia, marking the beginning of the Kingdom of Tungning. The kingdom was established by Zheng as a base for his operations against the Qing dynasty, which had recently conquered China.\n\n### Retreat to Taiwan\n\nZheng had retreated to Taiwan from mainland China, where he had been waging a campaign against the Qing dynasty.

The season featured a diverse cast of 16 houseguests competing for the grand prize of $750,000.\n\n# Format\n\nThe format of Big Brother 25 remained largely unchanged from previous seasons. A group of contestants, known as \"houseguests,\" lived together in a specially designed house with cameras and microphones recording their every move.

Wade. The protests continued after the ruling was officially announced on June 24, 2022, and have persisted throughout 2023 and into 2024.\n\n# Background\n\n## Leaked draft opinion\n\nOn May 2, 2022, Politico published a leaked draft opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito, which suggested that the Supreme Court would overturn Roe v. Wade. The draft opinion stated that the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion and that the authority to regulate abortion should be returned to the states. The leak sparked widespread outrage and protests across the United States.\n\n## Overturning of Roe v. Wade\n\nOn June 24, 2022, the Supreme Court officially announced its decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, overturning Roe v. Wade and eliminating the constitutional right to abortion. The ruling allowed individual states to regulate or prohibit abortion, leading to a surge in protests and demonstrations across the country.\n\n# Protests before the ruling\n\nProtests began immediately after the leak of the draft opinion and continued in the days and weeks leading up to the official ruling.\n\n## Midwest\n\nProtests took place in major cities across the Midwest, including Chicago, Illinois; Detroit, Michigan; and Minneapolis, Minnesota. Demonstrators gathered outside state capitol buildings, federal courthouses, and other public spaces to express their opposition to the potential overturning of Roe v. Wade.\n\n## Northeast\n\nProtests in the Northeast were widespread, with large demonstrations taking place in cities such as New York City and Boston.\n\n### New York\n\nIn New York City, thousands of protesters gathered in Times Square and outside the New York Public Library to express their opposition to the potential overturning of Roe v. Wade. The city's mayor, Eric Adams, spoke at the rally, stating that New York would remain a safe haven for women seeking abortion care.\n\n## South\n\nProtests in the South were also widespread, with demonstrations taking place in cities such as Miami, Florida; Atlanta, Georgia; and Nashville, Tennessee.\n\n### Florida\n\nIn Florida, protesters gathered outside the state capitol building in Tallahassee to express their opposition to the potential overturning of Roe v. Wade. The state's governor, Ron DeSantis, had previously signed a bill restricting access to abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy.\n\n### Washington, D.C.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., protesters gathered outside the Supreme Court building, where they were met by a heavy police presence. The demonstrations were largely peaceful, but some protesters were arrested for attempting to block traffic.\n\n## West\n\nProtests on the West Coast were also widespread, with large demonstrations taking place in cities such as Los Angeles, California; San Francisco, California; and Seattle, Washington.\n\n### California\n\nIn California, protesters gathered outside the state capitol building in Sacramento to express their opposition to the potential overturning of Roe v. Wade. The state's governor, Gavin Newsom, had previously announced plans to make California a sanctuary state for women seeking abortion care.\n\n## Outside the United States\n\nProtests also took place outside the United States, with demonstrations occurring in cities such as London, England; Paris, France; and Toronto, Canada. These protests were largely in solidarity with American protesters and expressed opposition to the potential overturning of Roe v. Wade.\n\n# Women's March\n\nThe Women's March, a national organization that advocates for women's rights, played a key role in organizing protests across the United States. The organization helped to coordinate demonstrations and rallies, and provided resources and support to local activists.\n\n# Response\n\nThe response to the protests was mixed, with some politicians and activists expressing support for the demonstrations and others criticizing them.\n\n## About protests outside private homes\n\nSome politicians and activists criticized protesters for demonstrating outside the private homes of Supreme Court justices, arguing that this tactic was unacceptable and potentially intimidating. However, others argued that the protests were necessary to draw attention to the issue and to hold the justices accountable for their actions.\n\n# Protests after the ruling\n\nProtests continued after the official ruling was announced on June 24, 2022, and have persisted throughout 2023 and into 2024.\n\n## 2022\n\nIn the days and weeks following the ruling, protests took place in cities across the United States. Demonstrators expressed their outrage and disappointment at the decision, and called for action to protect access to abortion care.\n\n## 2023\n\nIn 2023, protests continued, with demonstrators marking the one-year anniversary of the ruling and calling for further action to protect reproductive rights.\n\n## 2024\n\nIn 2024, protests have continued, with demonstrators expressing their opposition to state-level restrictions on abortion and calling for federal action to protect reproductive rights.\n\n## Midwest\n\nProtests in the Midwest have continued, with demonstrators expressing their opposition to state-level restrictions on abortion and calling for further action to protect reproductive rights.\n\n### 2022\n\nIn 2022, protests in the Midwest were widespread, with demonstrations taking place in cities such as Chicago, Illinois; Detroit, Michigan; and Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n\n### 2023\n\nIn 2023, protests in the Midwest continued, with demonstrators marking the one-year anniversary of the ruling and calling for further action to protect reproductive rights.\n\n### 2024\n\nIn 2024, protests in the Midwest have continued, with demonstrators expressing their opposition to state-level restrictions on abortion and calling for federal action to protect reproductive rights.\n\n## Northeast\n\nProtests in the Northeast have continued, with demonstrators expressing their opposition to state-level restrictions on abortion and calling for further action to protect reproductive rights.\n\n### 2022\n\nIn 2022, protests in the Northeast were widespread, with demonstrations taking place in cities such as New York City and Boston.\n\n### 2023\n\nIn 2023, protests in the Northeast continued, with demonstrators marking the one-year anniversary of the ruling and calling for further action to protect reproductive rights.\n\n### 2024\n\nIn 2024, protests in the Northeast have continued, with demonstrators expressing their opposition to state-level restrictions on abortion and calling for federal action to protect reproductive rights.\n\n## South\n\nProtests in the South have continued, with demonstrators expressing their opposition to state-level restrictions on abortion and calling for further action to protect reproductive rights.\n\n### 2022\n\nIn 2022, protests in the South were widespread, with demonstrations taking place in cities such as Miami, Florida; Atlanta, Georgia; and Nashville, Tennessee.\n\n### 2023\n\nIn 2023, protests in the South continued, with demonstrators marking the one-year anniversary of the ruling and calling for further action to protect reproductive rights.\n\n### 2024\n\nIn 2024, protests in the South have continued, with demonstrators expressing their opposition to state-level restrictions on abortion and calling for federal action to protect reproductive rights.\n\n## West\n\nProtests on the West Coast have continued, with demonstrators expressing their opposition to state-level restrictions on abortion and calling for further action to protect reproductive rights.\n\n### 2022\n\nIn 2022, protests on the West Coast were widespread, with demonstrations taking place in cities such as Los Angeles, California; San Francisco, California; and Seattle, Washington.\n\n### 2023\n\nIn 2023, protests on the West Coast continued, with demonstrators marking the one-year anniversary of the ruling and calling for further action to protect reproductive rights.\n\n### 2024\n\nIn 2024, protests on the West Coast have continued, with demonstrators expressing their opposition to state-level restrictions on abortion and calling for federal action to protect reproductive rights.\n\n### Arizona\n\nProtests in Arizona have been particularly notable, with demonstrators expressing their opposition to a state law that bans abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy.\n\n#### 2022\n\nIn 2022, protests in Arizona were widespread, with demonstrations taking place in cities such as Phoenix and Tucson.\n\n#### 2024\n\nIn 2024, protests in Arizona have continued, with demonstrators expressing their opposition to the state law and calling for federal action to protect reproductive rights.\n\n## Outside the United States\n\nProtests outside the United States have also continued, with demonstrators expressing their solidarity with American protesters and calling for action to protect reproductive rights.\n\n# See also\n\n* Abortion in the United States\n* Dobbs v.

She is considered a symbol of French resistance and a Catholic saint. Born on January 6, 1412, in the village of Domremy, Joan of Arc would go on to become one of the most famous women in French history.\n\n# Name\n\nThe name \"Joan of Arc\" is an English translation of the French name \"Jeanne d'Arc.\" \"Joan\" is the English equivalent of the French name \"Jeanne,\" which means \"God is gracious.\" \"Arc\" is a reference to her father's name, Jacques Arc, and was a common way to identify someone in medieval France.\n\n# Birth and historical background\n\nJoan of Arc was born on January 6, 1412, in the village of Domremy, which is now part of the department of Vosges in northeastern France. At the time of her birth, the Hundred Years' War between France and England was in its 75th year. The war had begun in 1337 and would not end until 1453. The war was fought over issues of succession to the French throne and control of French territory.\n\n# Early life\n\nJoan of Arc grew up in a peasant family in the village of Domremy. Her father, Jacques Arc, was a farmer, and her mother, Isabelle Romée, was a homemaker. Joan was the third of five children. She received little formal education, but she was raised in a devoutly Catholic household and was taught to pray and attend church regularly.\n\n# Chinon\n\nIn 1429, at the age of 17, Joan of Arc traveled to the city of Vaucouleurs to petition Robert de Baudricourt, the garrison commander, for an escort to take her to the French court at Chinon. She had received visions from God, which she believed instructed her to drive the English out of France and crown the Dauphin, Charles VII, as the rightful king of France.\n\n# Military campaigns\n\nJoan of Arc's military campaigns began in 1429 and lasted for over a year. During this time, she led the French army to several victories and became a national heroine.\n\n## Orléans\n\nJoan of Arc's first major victory was the siege of Orléans, which had been under siege by the English for over a year. She arrived at the city on April 29, 1429, and quickly became a leader among the French troops. She led several successful attacks against the English and helped to lift the siege on May 8, 1429.\n\n## Loire Campaign\n\nAfter the siege of Orléans, Joan of Arc led the French army on a campaign along the Loire River. They captured several cities, including Jargeau, Meung-sur-Loire, and Beaugency. These victories helped to secure the Loire Valley and paved the way for the French army to march on the city of Reims.\n\n## Coronation and siege of Paris\n\nOn July 17, 1429, Charles VII was crowned king of France at the cathedral in Reims. Joan of Arc was present at the ceremony and played a key role in the events leading up to it. However, she was not present at the siege of Paris, which began in September 1429. The siege was unsuccessful, and the French army was forced to withdraw.\n\n## Campaign against Perrinet Gressart\n\nIn the spring of 1430, Joan of Arc led a campaign against Perrinet Gressart, a French nobleman who had allied himself with the English. She was successful in capturing several of his strongholds, but she was eventually captured by the Burgundians, who were allies of the English.\n\n## Siege of Compiègne and capture\n\nJoan of Arc was captured by the Burgundians on May 23, 1430, while leading an attack on the town of Compiègne. She was taken prisoner and eventually sold to the English.\n\n# Trials and execution\n\nJoan of Arc was put on trial by the English, who accused her of heresy and witchcraft. The trial was a sham, and the outcome was predetermined.\n\n## Trial\n\nThe trial of Joan of Arc began on February 21, 1431. She was interrogated by a panel of church officials, who tried to get her to recant her visions and admit that she was a heretic. However, Joan refused to recant and maintained that her visions were from God.\n\n## Execution\n\nOn May 30, 1431, Joan of Arc was led to the market square in Rouen, where she was burned at the stake. She was 19 years old.\n\n## Aftermath and rehabilitation trial\n\nAfter Joan of Arc's execution, the English and their allies attempted to destroy her reputation and portray her as a heretic and a witch. However, the French people remembered her as a heroine, and she became a symbol of French resistance.\n\nIn 1456, 25 years after her execution, Pope Callixtus III authorized a rehabilitation trial, which declared Joan of Arc innocent and declared her a martyr.\n\n# Visions\n\nJoan of Arc believed that she received visions from God, which instructed her to drive the English out of France and crown the Dauphin, Charles VII, as the rightful king of France. Her visions were a key part of her mission and helped to guide her actions.\n\n# Clothing\n\nJoan of Arc wore men's clothing, which was unusual for a woman at the time. She wore a suit of armor and carried a sword, which helped her to blend in with the men in the French army.\n\n# Legacy\n\nJoan of Arc's legacy is complex and multifaceted. She is remembered as a military leader, a symbol of French resistance, and a Catholic saint.\n\n## Military leader and symbol of France\n\nJoan of Arc is remembered as a brilliant military leader who helped to turn the tide of the Hundred Years' War in favor of the French. She is a symbol of French resistance and a reminder of the country's rich history.\n\n## Saint and heroic woman\n\nJoan of Arc was canonized as a saint by the Catholic Church in 1920. She is remembered as a heroic woman who stood up for what she believed in and gave her life for her country.\n\n# See also\n\n* Hundred Years' War\n* Charles VII of France\n* Robert de Baudricourt\n* Perrinet Gressart\n* Trial of Joan of Arc\n\n# References\n\n*Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements.*\n\n# External links\n\n*Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements.*", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Joan_of_Arc\" following this outline:\n\n#Name\n#Birth and historical background\n#Early life\n#Chinon\n#Military campaigns\n##Orléans\n##Loire Campaign\n##Coronation and siege of Paris\n##Campaign against Perrinet Gressart\n##Siege of Compiègne and capture\n#Trials and execution\n##Trial\n##Execution\n##Aftermath and rehabilitation trial\n#Visions\n#Clothing\n#Legacy\n##Military leader and symbol of France\n##Saint and heroic woman\n#See also\n#References\n##Notes\n##Citations\n##Sources\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The Pishdadian dynasty is said to have been founded by the first king, Kayumars, who is also known as the \"first man\" in Persian mythology. According to legend, Kayumars was a just and wise ruler who brought order and civilization to the world.\n\nThe main sources for the Pishdadian dynasty are the Shahnameh, the Avesta, and the Bundahishn. The Shahnameh, which was written by the Persian poet Ferdowsi in the 10th century CE, is the most detailed and comprehensive source for the dynasty. The Avesta and the Bundahishn, which are both ancient Persian texts, also provide valuable information about the Pishdadian kings.\n\n#The Shahnameh and Zoroastrian tradition\n\n##Overview\n\nThe Shahnameh is an epic poem that tells the story of Iran's mythological and historical past. The poem begins with the creation of the world and the first humans, and it ends with the Arab conquest of Persia in the 7th century CE. The Pishdadian dynasty is a central part of the Shahnameh, and it is said to have ruled the world for over 2,000 years.\n\n##The kings\n\nAccording to the Shahnameh, the Pishdadian dynasty was founded by Kayumars, who was the first king of the world. Kayumars was succeeded by his son, Hushang, who discovered fire and introduced it to humanity. Hushang was succeeded by his son, Tahmuras, who was a great warrior and conqueror. Tahmuras was succeeded by his son, Jamshid, who was a wise and just ruler. Jamshid was said to have possessed magical powers and was able to communicate with the gods.\n\nThe Pishdadian dynasty continued to rule the world for many generations, producing many great kings, including Fereydun, Iraj, and Manuchehr. Fereydun was a just and wise ruler who divided the world among his three sons, Iraj, Salm, and Tur. Iraj was the youngest son, but he was the most wise and capable, and he inherited the throne. Salm and Tur rebelled against Iraj, but they were defeated, and Iraj became the sole ruler of the world.\n\nManuchehr was a great warrior and conqueror who expanded the Pishdadian empire and introduced many reforms. He was succeeded by his son, Nowzar, who was a wise and just ruler. Nowzar was succeeded by his son, Zaw, who was a great warrior and conqueror.\n\n#Tabari and the Muslim narratives\n\n##The first Pishdadian kings and the conflict with Iblis\n\nAccording to the Muslim historian Tabari, the Pishdadian dynasty was founded by Kayumars, who was the first king of the world. Kayumars was said to have been a just and wise ruler, but he was also said to have been in conflict with Iblis, the devil.\n\nAccording to Tabari, Iblis was a powerful and evil being who sought to destroy humanity. Kayumars and his successors fought against Iblis and his forces, but they were ultimately unable to defeat him. Iblis was said to have been responsible for the corruption and downfall of many of the Pishdadian kings.\n\n##From Jam al-Shidh to Zaw: al-Dahhak and war with the Turks\n\nAccording to Tabari, the Pishdadian dynasty continued to rule the world for many generations, producing many great kings. One of the most notable kings was Jam al-Shidh, who was said to have been a wise and just ruler. Jam al-Shidh was succeeded by his son, al-Dahhak, who was a great warrior and conqueror.\n\nAl-Dahhak was said to have been responsible for the expansion of the Pishdadian empire and the introduction of many reforms. However, he was also said to have been in conflict with the Turks, who were a powerful and nomadic people.\n\nThe war between the Pishdadian empire and the Turks was said to have been long and brutal, with both sides suffering heavy losses. Ultimately, the Pishdadian empire was able to defeat the Turks and expand its territories.\n\n#Significance\n\nThe Pishdadian dynasty is an important part of Persian mythology and history. The dynasty is said to have ruled the world for over 2,000 years, producing many great kings and introducing many reforms. The Pishdadian kings are often seen as symbols of wisdom, justice, and power, and their reign is often referred to as a golden age in Persian mythology.\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is based on the Shahnameh, the Avesta, and the Bundahishn, as well as the works of Tabari and other Muslim historians.\n\n#References\n\nThis article does not include any citations or references.\n\n#Bibliography\n\n##Translations of original sources\n\n* Ferdowsi, Abolqasem.

The city of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, had been subject to intense shelling and bombardment, causing significant damage and displacement. Ukrainian forces had been attempting to retake the oblast since the spring of 2022, but had been met with stubborn Russian resistance.\n\n#Prelude\n\nIn the days leading up to the counteroffensive, Ukrainian forces had been engaged in a series of minor skirmishes and reconnaissance missions along the front line in Kharkiv Oblast. The Russians had been reinforcing their positions in the region, but Ukrainian intelligence had identified weaknesses in the Russian defenses, particularly in the area around the city of Balakliia.\n\n#Counteroffensive\n\n##First phase (6–12 September 2022)\n\n###Initial advance\n\nOn September 6, 2022, Ukrainian forces launched the initial phase of the counteroffensive, with a series of coordinated attacks on Russian positions along the front line.

The coup was carried out by a group of military officers who seized power and declared the establishment of a new government.\n\n#Background\n\nNiger has a history of military coups, with several taking place since the country gained independence from France in 1960. The most recent coup prior to 2023 occurred in 2010, when President Mamadou Tandja was overthrown by a group of military officers.\n\nIn the years leading up to the 2023 coup, Niger faced several challenges, including poverty, corruption, and insecurity. The country has been affected by the Sahel conflict, which has led to the displacement of thousands of people and the killing of hundreds of civilians.\n\nPresident Mohamed Bazoum, who came to power in 2021, had promised to address these challenges and bring stability to the country. However, his government faced criticism for its handling of the security situation and its response to the economic crisis.\n\n#Events\n\n##26 July\n\n###Bazoum's detention\n\nOn 26 July 2023, President Mohamed Bazoum was detained by a group of military officers at the presidential palace in Niamey, the capital city of Niger. The officers, who were reportedly from the presidential guard, had been loyal to Bazoum but had become dissatisfied with his leadership.\n\n###Military mobilization\n\nFollowing Bazoum's detention, military units began to mobilize in Niamey and other parts of the country. The military officers who had carried out the coup began to take control of key government institutions, including the national television station and the airport.\n\n###Announcement of Bazoum's overthrow\n\nIn the evening of 26 July, the military officers announced on national television that Bazoum had been overthrown and a new government had been established. The officers, who identified themselves as the National Council for the Safeguard of the Homeland (CNSP), declared that they had taken power to restore order and stability to the country.\n\n##27 July\n\n###Bazoum's response\n\nOn 27 July, President Bazoum released a statement condemning the coup and calling on the military to return to their barracks. He declared that he remained the legitimate president of Niger and that the coup was a threat to democracy and stability in the country.\n\n###Military recognition of the junta\n\nDespite Bazoum's statement, the military continued to recognize the CNSP as the new government of Niger. The CNSP began to establish a new administration, with military officers taking control of key government ministries and institutions.\n\n##28 July\n\nThe CNSP announced the establishment of a new government, with General Abdourahamane Tchiani as the head of state. Tchiani, a former chief of staff of the Nigerien armed forces, had been a key figure in the coup and had been appointed as the leader of the CNSP.\n\n#Aftermath\n\nFollowing the coup, Niger was plunged into a period of uncertainty and instability. The country's borders were closed, and a curfew was imposed in Niamey and other major cities.\n\nThe international community, including the African Union and the European Union, condemned the coup and called for a return to democratic rule. The United States and France, which have significant interests in Niger, also condemned the coup and called for the restoration of democracy.\n\n#Reactions\n\n##Domestic\n\nThe reaction to the coup within Niger was mixed. Some people welcomed the coup, seeing it as an opportunity for change and reform. Others condemned the coup, seeing it as a threat to democracy and stability.\n\nThe opposition parties in Niger, which had been critical of Bazoum's government, welcomed the coup and called for the establishment of a new government. However, other groups, including civil society organizations and trade unions, condemned the coup and called for a return to democratic rule.\n\n##International\n\nThe international community condemned the coup and called for a return to democratic rule. The African Union, which has a policy of rejecting unconstitutional changes of government, suspended Niger's membership and called for the restoration of democracy.\n\nThe European Union, which has significant economic interests in Niger, also condemned the coup and called for a return to democratic rule. The United States, which has military bases in Niger, condemned the coup and called for the restoration of democracy.\n\n#Analysis\n\nThe 2023 Nigerien coup d'état was a significant event in the history of Niger and the Sahel region. The coup highlighted the instability and insecurity that has plagued the region in recent years and the challenges facing democratic governments in the region.\n\nThe coup also highlighted the role of the military in Nigerien politics and the challenges facing the country in establishing a stable and democratic government. The international community's reaction to the coup also highlighted the importance of democracy and stability in the region and the need for the international community to support democratic governments in the Sahel.\n\n#Notes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Nigerien_coup_d'état\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Events\n##26 July\n###Bazoum's detention\n###Military mobilization\n###Announcement of Bazoum's overthrow\n##27 July\n###Bazoum's response\n###Military recognition of the junta\n##28 July\n#Aftermath\n#Reactions\n##Domestic\n##International\n#Analysis\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The rebellion was led by Yevgeny Prigozhin, the founder and leader of the Wagner Group, who had grown increasingly critical of the Russian government's handling of the war in Ukraine.\n\n# Background\n\n## Yevgeny Prigozhin and the Wagner Group\n\nYevgeny Prigozhin is a Russian businessman and mercenary leader who founded the Wagner Group in 2014. The group is believed to be linked to the Russian government and has been involved in various conflicts around the world, including the Syrian Civil War and the War in Ukraine. Prigozhin has been sanctioned by the United States and the European Union for his alleged role in interfering in the 2016 US presidential election and for his involvement in human rights abuses in Africa.\n\n## Internal tensions during the invasion of Ukraine\n\nIn February 2022, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and the Wagner Group played a significant role in the conflict. However, as the war dragged on, internal tensions began to rise within the group. Prigozhin grew increasingly frustrated with the Russian government's handling of the war, which he believed was being mismanaged by the Ministry of Defense.\n\n### Order to integrate Wagner\n\nIn May 2023, the Russian government ordered the Wagner Group to integrate into the Russian military, which Prigozhin saw as an attempt to exert control over his organization. Prigozhin refused to comply with the order, citing concerns about the group's autonomy and the potential for the Russian military to take credit for Wagner's successes.\n\n## Planning the rebellion\n\nPrigozhin began to secretly plan a rebellion against the Russian government, which he believed was necessary to protect the Wagner Group's interests and to bring about change in Russia. He gathered support from within the group and from other dissatisfied elements within the Russian military.\n\n# Rebellion\n\n## Prigozhin's statements\n\nOn June 23, 2023, Prigozhin released a statement in which he rebuked the Russian government for its handling of the war in Ukraine and alleged that the government had attacked the Wagner Group. He also called for a rebellion against the government, which he claimed was necessary to bring about change in Russia.\n\n### Rebukes of the government and allegation of an attack on Wagner\n\nPrigozhin accused the Russian government of mismanaging the war in Ukraine and of failing to provide adequate support to the Wagner Group. He also alleged that the government had launched a missile strike against the group's base in Ukraine, which he claimed was an attempt to destroy the organization.\n\n### Call to rebellion\n\nPrigozhin called on Russians to rise up against the government, which he claimed was corrupt and ineffective. He promised to lead the rebellion and to bring about change in Russia.\n\n## Capture of Rostov-on-Don\n\nOn June 24, 2023, the Wagner Group captured the city of Rostov-on-Don, which is a major urban center in southern Russia. The group took control of key infrastructure, including the airport and the city's administrative buildings.\n\n## Advance towards Moscow\n\nAfter capturing Rostov-on-Don, the Wagner Group began to advance towards Moscow, which is located approximately 1,000 kilometers to the north. The group's forces moved rapidly, capturing key cities and towns along the way.\n\n## Security measures\n\nIn response to the rebellion, the Russian government imposed strict security measures, including a curfew and a ban on public gatherings. The government also deployed troops to key cities and towns, including Moscow.\n\n## Events in Syria\n\nThe rebellion had significant implications for Russia's involvement in the Syrian Civil War. The Wagner Group had been involved in the conflict since 2015, and its rebellion against the Russian government raised questions about the group's continued involvement in the war.\n\n# Resolution\n\nThe rebellion was eventually put down by the Russian government, which used a combination of military force and diplomacy to restore order. Prigozhin was forced to flee Russia, and the Wagner Group was disbanded.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## Domestic\n\n### Vladimir Putin's address\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin addressed the nation on June 25, 2023, in which he condemned the rebellion and promised to take action to restore order. He also accused the Wagner Group of being a \"gang of mercenaries\" and promised to bring the group's leaders to justice.\n\n### Other government-aligned figures\n\nOther government-aligned figures, including the head of the Russian military and the head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), also condemned the rebellion and promised to take action to restore order.\n\n### Anti-war opposition and anti-government armed groups\n\nThe rebellion was welcomed by anti-war opposition groups and anti-government armed groups, which saw it as an opportunity to bring about change in Russia.\n\n### Ultranationalists and milbloggers\n\nUltranationalists and milbloggers, who had been critical of the Russian government's handling of the war in Ukraine, also welcomed the rebellion.\n\n### Wider public\n\nThe wider public was divided in its response to the rebellion, with some people supporting the Wagner Group and others opposing it.\n\n## International\n\nThe rebellion was widely condemned by Western countries, which saw it as an attempt to destabilize Russia and the region. The United States, the European Union, and NATO all issued statements condemning the rebellion and calling for calm.\n\n# Aftermath\n\n## Fallout and restoring order\n\nThe rebellion had significant fallout, including the displacement of thousands of people and the destruction of key infrastructure. The Russian government took steps to restore order, including the deployment of troops and the imposition of strict security measures.\n\n## Subsequent statements\n\nPrigozhin released several statements after the rebellion, in which he claimed that the Russian government had launched a crackdown on the Wagner Group and its supporters. He also accused the government of attempting to silence him and his allies.\n\n## Fate of the Wagner Group and Yevgeny Prigozhin\n\n### Closure of criminal case and initial statements\n\nIn July 2023, the Russian government announced the closure of the criminal case against Prigozhin and the Wagner Group. Prigozhin released a statement in which he claimed that the closure of the case was a victory for the group and its supporters.\n\n### Crackdown on Wagner, alleged purges and related arrests\n\nHowever, the Russian government soon launched a crackdown on the Wagner Group, including the arrest of several of its members and the alleged purge of its leadership.\n\n### Prigozhin's return to Russia\n\nIn August 2023, Prigozhin returned to Russia, where he was met by government officials. He was reportedly taken into custody, although the details of his detention were not made public.\n\n### Death of Prigozhin and Utkin\n\nOn September 12, 2023, Prigozhin and several other top Wagner Group officials, including the group's second-in-command Dmitry Utkin, died in a plane crash in Russia's Tver region. The cause of the crash was not immediately clear.\n\n## Measures of NATO countries\n\nNATO countries took several measures in response to the rebellion, including the deployment of troops to Eastern Europe and the imposition of stricter security measures.\n\n# Analysis\n\n## Political\n\nThe rebellion had significant implications for Russian politics, including the potential for further instability and the rise of new opposition groups.\n\n## Military\n\nThe rebellion also had significant implications for the Russian military, including the potential for further conflicts and the rise of new military leaders.\n\n# See also\n\n* Wagner Group\n* Russian intervention in the Syrian Civil War\n* War in Ukraine\n* Russian involvement in the Syrian Civil War\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a summary of the key events and reactions surrounding the Wagner Group rebellion.

The election was necessitated by the resignation of 20 members of the Provincial Assembly of the Punjab (PAP), who belonged to the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, in June 2022. The by-elections were held to fill the vacant seats in 20 constituencies across the province.\n\n# Background\n\nThe PTI, led by Imran Khan, had been in power in Punjab since 2018, but its government was ousted in April 2022, following a no-confidence vote in the National Assembly. The PTI members of the PAP, who were loyal to Imran Khan, subsequently resigned from their seats in June 2022, in a bid to pressure the government to hold fresh elections. The resignations led to the creation of 20 vacant seats in the PAP, which were filled through the by-elections held on July 17, 2022.\n\n# Candidates\n\nA total of 176 candidates from 14 political parties and 2 independent candidates contested the by-elections. The main contenders were the PTI, the Pakistan Muslim League (N) (PML-N), and the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP). The PTI fielded candidates in all 20 constituencies, while the PML-N and PPP contested in 19 and 17 constituencies, respectively.\n\n# Results\n\nThe results of the by-elections were announced on July 17, 2022, by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP). The PTI emerged as the largest party, winning 15 seats, followed by the PML-N, which won 4 seats, and the PPP, which won 1 seat.\n\n## Result by Constituency\n\nHere is the result of the by-elections by constituency:\n\n| Constituency | Winner | Party |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| PP-7 Rawalpindi | Sajawal Khan | PTI |\n| PP-83 Khushab | Hassan Aslam Awan | PML-N |\n| PP-90 Bhakkar | Irfanullah Khan Niazi | PTI |\n| PP-97 Faisalabad | Ali Afzal Sahi | PML-N |\n| PP-125 Jhang | Mehar Muhammad Nawaz | PTI |\n| PP-127 Jhang | Amanullah Shadikhel | PTI |\n| PP-140 Sheikhupura | Khurram Shehzad | PML-N |\n| PP-158 Lahore | Rana Ahsan Sharafat | PML-N |\n| PP-167 Lahore | Nazir Chohan | PTI |\n| PP-168 Lahore | Malik Asad Ali Khokhar | PTI |\n| PP-170 Lahore | Raja Sagheer Ahmed | PTI |\n| PP-202 Sahiwal | Zulfiqar Ali Bhatti | PTI |\n| PP-217 Multan | Muhammad Salman Naeem | PTI |\n| PP-224 Lodhran | Muhammad Shoaib Awaisi | PTI |\n| PP-228 Lodhran | Pir Mansoor Sarwar | PTI |\n| PP-237 Bahawalnagar | Syed Muhammad Mohsin | PTI |\n| PP-272 Muzaffargarh | Zahir Hussain Khan | PPP |\n| PP-273 Muzaffargarh | Muhammad Ahsan Ansari | PTI |\n| PP-282 Layyah | Faiz Ahmad | PTI |\n| PP-288 Dera Ghazi Khan | Sardar Muhammad Khan Leghari | PTI |\n\n## Constituency-wise Detailed Result\n\nHere is the detailed result of the by-elections by constituency:\n\n### PP-7 Rawalpindi\n\n* Sajawal Khan (PTI) - 49,628 votes\n* Shakeel Awan (PML-N) - 28,631 votes\n* Muhammad Shoaib (PPP) - 2,497 votes\n\n### PP-83 Khushab\n\n* Hassan Aslam Awan (PML-N) - 44,839 votes\n* Muhammad Ashraf (PTI) - 36,811 votes\n* Muhammad Ayub (PPP) - 2,541 votes\n\n### PP-90 Bhakkar\n\n* Irfanullah Khan Niazi (PTI) - 53,751 votes\n* Amjad Ali (PML-N) - 24,753 votes\n* Sajid Mehmood (PPP) - 1,831 votes\n\n### PP-97 Faisalabad\n\n* Ali Afzal Sahi (PML-N) - 34,923 votes\n* Muhammad Umar Farooq (PTI) - 29,431 votes\n* Muhammad Ahsan (PPP) - 2,213 votes\n\n### PP-125 Jhang\n\n* Mehar Muhammad Nawaz (PTI) - 55,561 votes\n* Muhammad Ahmed (PML-N) - 23,159 votes\n* Muhammad Shoaib (PPP) - 2,032 votes\n\n### PP-127 Jhang\n\n* Amanullah Shadikhel (PTI) - 51,925 votes\n* Muhammad Arshad (PML-N) - 22,113 votes\n* Muhammad Ayub (PPP) - 1,814 votes\n\n### PP-140 Sheikhupura\n\n* Khurram Shehzad (PML-N) - 44,514 votes\n* Muhammad Ali (PTI) - 36,155 votes\n* Muhammad Iqbal (PPP) - 2,404 votes\n\n### PP-158 Lahore\n\n* Rana Ahsan Sharafat (PML-N) - 31,534 votes\n* Muhammad Bilal (PTI) - 24,601 votes\n* Muhammad Ahsan (PPP) - 2,115 votes\n\n### PP-167 Lahore\n\n* Nazir Chohan (PTI) - 30,495 votes\n* Muhammad Usman (PML-N) - 22,355 votes\n* Muhammad Shoaib (PPP) - 1,989 votes\n\n### PP-168 Lahore\n\n* Malik Asad Ali Khokhar (PTI) - 34,917 votes\n* Muhammad Ahmed (PML-N) - 24,423 votes\n* Muhammad Ayub (PPP) - 2,062 votes\n\n### PP-170 Lahore\n\n* Raja Sagheer Ahmed (PTI) - 32,621 votes\n* Muhammad Ali (PML-N) - 23,191 votes\n* Muhammad Iqbal (PPP) - 2,058 votes\n\n### PP-202 Sahiwal\n\n* Zulfiqar Ali Bhatti (PTI) - 53,598 votes\n* Muhammad Shoaib (PML-N) - 25,631 votes\n* Muhammad Ayub (PPP) - 2,161 votes\n\n### PP-217 Multan\n\n* Muhammad Salman Naeem (PTI) - 44,441 votes\n* Muhammad Arshad (PML-N) - 26,113 votes\n* Muhammad Shoaib (PPP) - 2,369 votes\n\n### PP-224 Lodhran\n\n* Muhammad Shoaib Awaisi (PTI) - 48,509 votes\n* Muhammad Ali (PML-N) - 24,039 votes\n* Muhammad Ayub (PPP) - 2,086 votes\n\n### PP-228 Lodhran\n\n* Pir Mansoor Sarwar (PTI) - 53,327 votes\n* Muhammad Shoaib (PML-N) - 25,347 votes\n* Muhammad Ahsan (PPP) - 2,144 votes\n\n### PP-237 Bahawalnagar\n\n* Syed Muhammad Mohsin (PTI) - 45,116 votes\n* Muhammad Ahmed (PML-N) - 26,197 votes\n* Muhammad Ayub (PPP) - 2,318 votes\n\n### PP-272 Muzaffargarh\n\n* Zahir Hussain Khan (PPP) - 39,457 votes\n* Muhammad Ahsan (PTI) - 33,595 votes\n* Muhammad Shoaib (PML-N) - 2,634 votes\n\n### PP-273 Muzaffargarh\n\n* Muhammad Ahsan Ansari (PTI) - 40,151 votes\n* Muhammad Ayub (PML-N) - 28,402 votes\n* Muhammad Shoaib (PPP) - 2,611 votes\n\n### PP-282 Layyah\n\n* Faiz Ahmad (PTI) - 51,331 votes\n* Muhammad Shoaib (PML-N) - 24,599 votes\n* Muhammad Ayub (PPP) - 2,363 votes\n\n### PP-288 Dera Ghazi Khan\n\n* Sardar Muhammad Khan Leghari (PTI) - 54,101 votes\n* Muhammad Ahmed (PML-N) - 26,351 votes\n* Muhammad Shoaib (PPP) - 2,512 votes\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe results of the by-elections were widely seen as a setback for the PTI, which had been expecting to win all 20 seats. The party's failure to win more seats was attributed to the low turnout of voters, as well as the fact that the PML-N had fielded strong candidates in many constituencies. The PTI's leadership, including Imran Khan, accused the ECP of rigging the elections, but the ECP denied these allegations.\n\n# Election for Chief Minister\n\nFollowing the by-elections, the PML-N and PPP formed an alliance to elect a new Chief Minister of Punjab. The two parties nominated Hamza Shehbaz, the son of Shehbaz Sharif, as their candidate for the post. Hamza Shehbaz was elected as the new Chief Minister of Punjab on April 16, 2022, with the support of 197 members of the PAP.\n\n# Notes\n\nThe July 2022 Punjab provincial by-elections were significant because they marked a turning point in the politics of Punjab, which had been dominated by the PTI since 2018. The election results showed that the PTI was not invincible, and that other parties, including the PML-N and PPP, could challenge its dominance. The election also highlighted the importance of alliances and coalitions in Pakistani politics, as the PML-N and PPP were able to form an alliance to elect a new Chief Minister of Punjab.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"July_2022_Punjab_provincial_by-election\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Candidates\n#Results\n##Result by Constituency\n##Constituency-wise Detailed Result\n###PP-7 Rawalpindi\n###PP-83 Khushab\n###PP-90 Bhakkar\n###PP-97 Faisalabad\n###PP-125 Jhang\n###PP-127 Jhang\n###PP-140 Sheikhupura\n###PP-158 Lahore\n###PP-167 Lahore\n###PP-168 Lahore\n###PP-170 Lahore\n###PP-202 Sahiwal\n###PP-217 Multan\n###PP-224 Lodhran\n###PP-228 Lodhran\n###PP-237 Bahawalnagar\n###PP-272 Muzaffargarh\n###PP-273 Muzaffargarh\n###PP-282 Layyah\n###PP-288 Dera Ghazi Khan\n#Aftermath\n#Election for Chief Minister\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

They are typically located in the upper right corner of the periodic table, to the right of the metalloids. Nonmetals are characterized by their ability to gain electrons to form ions with a negative charge, and they often exhibit covalent bonding in their compounds.\n\n# Definition and applicable elements\n\nNonmetals are defined as elements that do not typically exhibit the characteristics of metals, such as malleability, ductility, and the ability to conduct electricity. They are usually located in the p-block of the periodic table, which includes the elements in groups 13-18. The nonmetal elements include hydrogen (H), carbon (C), nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), fluorine (F), neon (Ne), phosphorus (P), sulfur (S), chlorine (Cl), argon (Ar), selenium (Se), bromine (Br), krypton (Kr), iodine (I), and xenon (Xe).\n\n# General properties\n\n## Physical\n\nNonmetals exhibit a wide range of physical properties, including variations in melting and boiling points, density, and crystal structure.\n\n### Allotropes\n\nSome nonmetals, such as carbon and sulfur, exist in multiple allotropes, which are different forms of the same element with different crystal structures. For example, carbon can exist as diamond, graphite, or fullerenes, each with unique properties.\n\n## Chemical\n\nNonmetals tend to exhibit covalent bonding in their compounds, rather than ionic bonding. They often form molecules with other nonmetals, and these molecules can be polar or nonpolar, depending on the electronegativity of the atoms involved.\n\n## Complications\n\nNonmetals can exhibit a range of complications, including anomalies in their periodic trends and unusual chemical properties.\n\n### First row anomaly\n\nThe first row of the periodic table, which includes the elements hydrogen, helium, lithium, beryllium, boron, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, and neon, exhibits a number of anomalies. For example, the electronegativity of the elements in the first row is not as well-behaved as in the other rows, and the elements in the first row tend to form more polar bonds than elements in other rows.\n\n### Secondary periodicity\n\nNonmetals can exhibit secondary periodicity, which refers to the repetition of trends in properties across rows of the periodic table. For example, the elements in group 14 (carbon, silicon, germanium, tin, and lead) exhibit a secondary periodic trend in electronegativity, with the elements in the first row being more electronegative than those in subsequent rows.\n\n### Higher oxidation states\n\nNonmetals can exhibit higher oxidation states than metals, particularly in the case of the halogens and the noble gases. For example, fluorine can exhibit an oxidation state of +7, while chlorine can exhibit an oxidation state of +7.\n\n### Multiple bond formation\n\nNonmetals can form multiple bonds, including double and triple bonds, particularly in the case of the elements carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen.\n\n### Property overlaps\n\nNonmetals can exhibit property overlaps, where the properties of one element blend into those of another. For example, the properties of phosphorus and sulfur overlap, making it difficult to distinguish between the two elements based on their properties alone.\n\n# Types\n\nNonmetals can be classified into several types, including noble gases, halogen nonmetals, and unclassified nonmetals.\n\n## Noble gases\n\nThe noble gases are a group of nonmetals that are located in the far right column of the periodic table. They are characterized by their unreactivity and include the elements helium (He), neon (Ne), argon (Ar), krypton (Kr), xenon (Xe), and radon (Rn).\n\n## Halogen nonmetals\n\nThe halogen nonmetals are a group of nonmetals that are located in the column to the left of the noble gases. They are characterized by their reactivity and include the elements fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), iodine (I), and astatine (At).\n\n## Unclassified nonmetals\n\nThe unclassified nonmetals are a group of nonmetals that do not fit into the other categories. They include the elements hydrogen (H), carbon (C), nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), phosphorus (P), sulfur (S), and selenium (Se).\n\n# Abundance, extraction, and uses\n\n## Abundance\n\nNonmetals are abundant in the Earth's crust and atmosphere. They can be found in a wide range of minerals and rocks, and they are often extracted from these sources through various mining and refining processes.\n\n## Extraction\n\nNonmetals can be extracted from a variety of sources, including rocks, minerals, and atmospheric gases. The extraction process often involves the use of chemical reactions, heat, and pressure to separate the nonmetal from other elements.\n\n## Uses\n\nNonmetals have a wide range of uses, including in the production of fuels, chemicals, and materials. They are also used in the manufacture of electronic devices, such as computers and smartphones.\n\n# Taxonomical history\n\n## Background\n\nThe concept of nonmetals has been around for centuries, with early chemists recognizing the differences between metals and nonmetals. However, it wasn't until the development of the periodic table that nonmetals were formally classified as a separate group of elements.\n\n## Organization of elements by types\n\nThe periodic table organizes elements into groups based on their properties and electron configurations. Nonmetals are typically located in the upper right corner of the periodic table, to the right of the metalloids.\n\n## Development of types\n\nThe development of types of nonmetals has evolved over time, with new categories being added as our understanding of the elements has grown. The noble gases, halogen nonmetals, and unclassified nonmetals are the main categories of nonmetals.\n\n## Suggested distinguishing criteria\n\nThe distinguishing criteria for nonmetals include their ability to gain electrons to form ions with a negative charge, their tendency to exhibit covalent bonding, and their location in the p-block of the periodic table.\n\n# Comparison of selected properties\n\n## Physical properties by element type\n\nNonmetals exhibit a wide range of physical properties, including variations in melting and boiling points, density, and crystal structure.\n\n## Chemical properties by element type\n\nNonmetals tend to exhibit covalent bonding in their compounds, rather than ionic bonding. They often form molecules with other nonmetals, and these molecules can be polar or nonpolar, depending on the electronegativity of the atoms involved.\n\n# See also\n\n* Metal\n* Metalloid\n* Periodic table\n* Chemical element\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article provides a comprehensive overview of nonmetals, including their definition, properties, types, and uses.

The two engage in a series of violent battles, with Morbius trying to protect innocent lives and Crown seeking to exploit his powers for personal gain.\n\nCast\n-----\n\n* Jared Leto as Michael Morbius: A scientist suffering from a rare blood disorder who becomes a vampire-like creature after experimenting on himself.\n* Matt Smith as Loxias Crown: A former friend and fellow scientist of Morbius who undergoes a similar transformation and becomes a rival.\n* Adria Arjona as Martine Bancroft: A scientist and Morbius's love interest who helps him navigate his newfound powers.\n* Jared Harris as Emil Nicholas: A scientist and mentor to Morbius who becomes increasingly concerned about his protégé's actions.\n* Al Madrigal as Alberto Rodriguez: A detective tasked with investigating a series of murders linked to Morbius and Crown.\n* Tyrese Gibson as Simon Stroud: A mercenary hired to capture Morbius and exploit his powers.\n\nProduction\n------------\n\n### Development\n\nThe development of Morbius began in 2016, when Sony Pictures announced plans to create a shared universe of Marvel Comics characters, with Morbius being one of the first films in development.

The riots were marked by widespread violence, looting, and destruction of property, and were widely condemned by public officials and media.\n\n# Background\n\n## Killing of Nahel Merzouk\n\nOn June 27, 2023, Nahel Merzouk, a 17-year-old French teenager of Algerian descent, was shot and killed by a police officer in the commune of Nanterre, in the Hauts-de-Seine department of metropolitan France. The police officer involved in the shooting claimed that Merzouk had threatened him with a screwdriver, but eyewitness accounts and video footage suggested that Merzouk was unarmed and had been shot without provocation.\n\n## 2017 law concerning traffic stops\n\nIn 2017, the French government passed a law allowing police officers to conduct traffic stops without justification, which critics argued would lead to increased racial profiling and police brutality. The law was widely criticized by civil rights groups and community leaders, who argued that it would disproportionately affect minority communities.\n\n## Civil unrest related to policing\n\nThe Nahel Merzouk riots were not an isolated incident, but rather part of a larger pattern of civil unrest related to policing in France. In recent years, there have been numerous protests and riots in response to police brutality and racial profiling, including the 2020 protests against the police killing of George Floyd in the United States.\n\n## Police brutality in France\n\nPolice brutality is a long-standing issue in France, with numerous high-profile cases of police violence and misconduct in recent years. According to a 2020 report by the French National Assembly, there were over 1,000 complaints of police brutality filed in 2019 alone.\n\n## Racial profiling and false reporting\n\nRacial profiling and false reporting are also significant issues in France, with numerous studies showing that minority communities are disproportionately targeted by police and subject to false or discriminatory reporting. A 2020 report by the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies found that individuals of African and Arab descent were three times more likely to be stopped by police than individuals of European descent.\n\n## Social problems\n\nThe Nahel Merzouk riots also highlighted deeper social problems in France, including poverty, unemployment, and social inequality. Many of the communities affected by the riots were already struggling with high levels of poverty and unemployment, and the riots were seen by some as a manifestation of these underlying social issues.\n\n# Events\n\n## Metropolitan France\n\n### 27–28 June\n\nThe riots began on June 27, 2023, in the commune of Nanterre, where Nahel Merzouk was killed. The initial protests were peaceful, but quickly turned violent as police clashed with protesters. The riots spread rapidly to other parts of metropolitan France, including the cities of Paris, Lyon, and Marseille.\n\n### 29–30 June\n\nOn June 29-30, the riots intensified, with widespread looting and destruction of property. The city of Paris was particularly affected, with numerous businesses and buildings vandalized or set on fire.\n\n### 1–2 July\n\nOn July 1-2, the riots continued, with protests and violence reported in numerous cities across metropolitan France. The police responded with force, using tear gas and batons to disperse protesters.\n\n### 3–4 July\n\nOn July 3-4, the riots began to subside, as the police increased their presence on the streets and arrested numerous individuals suspected of participating in the violence.\n\n### 8 July\n\nOn July 8, a large protest was held in Paris, calling for justice for Nahel Merzouk and an end to police brutality. The protest was peaceful, but marked by a significant police presence.\n\n### 10 July\n\nOn July 10, the French government announced the creation of a new commission to investigate the Nahel Merzouk riots and make recommendations for preventing similar incidents in the future.\n\n## Overseas France\n\nThe Nahel Merzouk riots also had an impact on overseas France, particularly in the French overseas departments and territories. In the city of Fort-de-France, Martinique, protests and violence were reported on June 29-30, with numerous businesses and buildings vandalized or set on fire.\n\n## International\n\nThe Nahel Merzouk riots received significant international attention, with numerous countries and organizations condemning the violence and calling for an investigation into the killing of Nahel Merzouk. The United States, the United Kingdom, and the European Union all issued statements expressing concern about the situation and calling for calm.\n\n# Damage to cultural sites\n\nThe Nahel Merzouk riots resulted in significant damage to cultural sites, including museums, libraries, and historical buildings. In the city of Paris, numerous museums and cultural institutions were vandalized or looted, including the Louvre Museum and the National Library of France.\n\n# Estimated cost of the riots\n\nThe estimated cost of the Nahel Merzouk riots is significant, with numerous businesses and buildings destroyed or damaged.
