The crisis began with the resignation of several senior government ministers, including Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak and Health Secretary Sajid Javid, and culminated in Johnson's announcement that he would step down as Conservative Party leader and Prime Minister.\n\n#Background\n\nThe crisis was sparked by a series of scandals and controversies surrounding Johnson's leadership, including the Partygate scandal, which involved allegations of COVID-19 lockdown breaches at 10 Downing Street. Johnson had also faced criticism for his handling of the economy, the cost of living crisis, and the war in Ukraine.\n\nIn the months leading up to the crisis, Johnson had faced increasing pressure from within his own party to resign. Several Conservative MPs had submitted letters of no confidence in Johnson's leadership, but he had managed to cling to power. However, the resignation of Sunak and Javid on July 5, 2022, marked a significant turning point in the crisis.\n\n#Collapse of the government\n\nThe resignations of Sunak and Javid were followed by a wave of departures from the government, including several junior ministers and parliamentary private secretaries. The crisis deepened as more MPs called for Johnson to resign, and the party's whips struggled to maintain discipline.\n\n##Support for Johnson\n\nDespite the growing pressure on Johnson to resign, some Conservative MPs continued to express their support for him. Johnson's allies argued that he had a mandate from the 2019 general election and that he should be allowed to continue as Prime Minister. However, this support was not enough to save Johnson, and he eventually announced his intention to resign.\n\n#Resignation of Boris Johnson\n\nOn July 7, 2022, Johnson announced that he would step down as Conservative Party leader and Prime Minister. In a statement outside 10 Downing Street, Johnson said that he had tried to persuade his cabinet to stay, but it had become clear that the party had lost confidence in him. Johnson stated that he would remain as Prime Minister until a new leader was elected, but he would not seek to stay in office any longer than necessary.\n\n#Reactions\n\n##Domestic\n\nThe reaction to Johnson's resignation was mixed in the UK. Some people welcomed the news, seeing it as an opportunity for a fresh start and a chance to address the country's problems. Others were more skeptical, fearing that the crisis would lead to further instability and uncertainty.\n\nThe opposition Labour Party welcomed Johnson's resignation, but called for a general election to be held as soon as possible. Labour leader Keir Starmer said that the country needed a new government with a fresh mandate, and that Johnson's departure was not enough to restore trust in politics.\n\n##International\n\nThe international reaction to Johnson's resignation was also mixed. Some world leaders, including US President Joe Biden, expressed their appreciation for Johnson's leadership and said that they would miss working with him. Others, including European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, welcomed the opportunity for a fresh start in UK-EU relations.\n\n#List of departures\n\n* Rishi Sunak, Chancellor of the Exchequer\n* Sajid Javid, Health Secretary\n* Alex Chalk, Solicitor General\n* Bim Afolami, Conservative Party Vice Chairman\n* Saqib Bhatti, Conservative Party Vice Chairman\n* Jonathan Gullis, Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland\n* Nicola Richards, Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Department for Transport\n* Virginia Crosbie, Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Welsh Secretary\n\n#See also\n\n* Partygate\n* 2022 UK government crisis\n* Boris Johnson\n* Conservative Party (UK)\n* List of resignations from the Johnson ministry\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is about the July 2022 United Kingdom government crisis.

The dam was constructed between 1950 and 1958 and played a crucial role in the region's energy production, irrigation, and water supply. On June 6, 2023, the dam was destroyed, causing widespread flooding, displacement of people, and significant economic and environmental damage.\n\n#Background\n\nThe Kakhovka Dam was built during the Soviet era as part of a larger hydroelectric project on the Dnieper River. The dam was designed to generate electricity, regulate the river's flow, and provide water for irrigation and industrial purposes. Over the years, the dam became a vital component of Ukraine's energy infrastructure, providing power to millions of people and supporting the country's agricultural sector.\n\nIn 2022, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the dam became a strategic location, with both sides seeking to control it. Ukrainian forces had maintained control of the dam, but the surrounding area had been the site of intense fighting. The dam's destruction was seen as a catastrophic event that would have far-reaching consequences for the region.\n\n#Destruction\n\nOn June 6, 2023, at approximately 2:50 a.m. local time, a massive explosion was reported at the Kakhovka Dam. The blast caused significant damage to the dam's structure, leading to a catastrophic failure of the dam's walls. The resulting floodwave swept through the surrounding area, inundating nearby towns and villages.\n\nThe exact cause of the explosion is still unknown, but it is believed to have been the result of a deliberate act of sabotage. Both Ukrainian and Russian forces have denied responsibility for the destruction of the dam.\n\n#Responsibility\n\nThe question of responsibility for the destruction of the Kakhovka Dam remains a contentious issue. Ukrainian officials have accused Russian forces of carrying out the sabotage, while Russian authorities have blamed Ukrainian forces for the explosion.\n\nThe Ukrainian government has claimed that Russian forces had been seeking to destroy the dam in order to disrupt Ukraine's energy production and irrigation systems. Ukrainian officials have also pointed to the fact that Russian forces had been shelling the dam in the days leading up to the explosion.\n\nOn the other hand, Russian authorities have denied any involvement in the destruction of the dam. They have claimed that Ukrainian forces had been seeking to create a humanitarian crisis in order to garner international sympathy.\n\n#Effects\n\nThe destruction of the Kakhovka Dam has had far-reaching consequences for the region.\n\n##Casualties\n\nThe exact number of casualties resulting from the destruction of the dam is still unknown. However, it is reported that dozens of people have been killed, and many more have been injured.\n\n##Flooding and evacuations\n\nThe floodwave caused by the dam's destruction has inundated nearby towns and villages, forcing thousands of people to evacuate their homes. Many communities have been left without access to basic necessities such as food, water, and shelter.\n\n##Animals and environment\n\nThe flooding has also had a devastating impact on the region's wildlife. Many animals have been killed or displaced, and the flooding has caused significant damage to the region's ecosystem.\n\n##Military impact\n\nThe destruction of the dam has also had significant military implications. The flooding has disrupted supply lines and communication networks, making it difficult for Ukrainian forces to operate in the region.\n\n##Water supply\n\nThe dam's destruction has also disrupted the region's water supply. The dam had provided water for irrigation and industrial purposes, and its destruction has left many communities without access to clean water.\n\n##North Crimean Canal\n\nThe destruction of the dam has also affected the North Crimean Canal, which had been supplied with water from the dam. The canal is a vital source of water for the Crimean Peninsula, and its disruption has caused significant economic and environmental damage.\n\n##Farming\n\nThe flooding has also had a devastating impact on the region's agricultural sector. Many farms have been inundated, and crops have been destroyed. The flooding has also disrupted the region's irrigation systems, making it difficult for farmers to access water.\n\n##Fisheries\n\nThe flooding has also affected the region's fisheries. Many fish farms have been destroyed, and the flooding has caused significant damage to the region's aquatic ecosystem.\n\n##Energy\n\nThe destruction of the dam has also had a significant impact on the region's energy production. The dam had provided power to millions of people, and its destruction has left many communities without access to electricity.\n\n##Costs of reconstruction\n\nThe costs of reconstructing the dam are estimated to be in the billions of dollars. The Ukrainian government has pledged to rebuild the dam, but the process is expected to take several years.\n\n#Legal responses\n\nThe destruction of the Kakhovka Dam has raised significant legal questions. The Ukrainian government has accused Russian forces of committing a war crime, and has called for an international investigation into the incident.\n\n#Reactions\n\n##Ukrainian reactions\n\nThe Ukrainian government has condemned the destruction of the dam as a \"barbaric act of terrorism.\" Ukrainian officials have called for international condemnation of the incident and have pledged to seek justice for those responsible.\n\n##Russian reactions\n\nThe Russian government has denied any involvement in the destruction of the dam. Russian officials have accused Ukrainian forces of seeking to create a humanitarian crisis and have pledged to continue supporting separatist forces in eastern Ukraine.\n\n##International reactions\n\nThe international community has condemned the destruction of the dam as a catastrophic event that has caused significant human suffering. Many countries have pledged to provide humanitarian assistance to those affected by the flooding.\n\n#Aftermath\n\nThe destruction of the Kakhovka Dam has had far-reaching consequences for the region. The incident has raised significant questions about the use of force in conflict zones and the need for international cooperation to prevent such incidents in the future.\n\n#See also\n\n##Similar international events\n\n* Sinking of the MV Wilhelm Gustloff\n* Sinking of the MV Goya\n* Destruction of the Mosul Dam\n\n##General\n\n* List of hydroelectric power plants in Ukraine\n* List of dams and reservoirs in Ukraine\n* 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine\n\n#Notes\n\n#References\n\n#External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Destruction_of_the_Kakhovka_Dam\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Destruction\n#Responsibility\n#Effects\n##Casualties\n##Flooding and evacuations\n##Animals and environment\n##Military impact\n##Water supply\n##North Crimean Canal\n##Farming\n##Fisheries\n##Energy\n##Costs of reconstruction\n#Legal responses\n#Reactions\n##Ukrainian reactions\n##Russian reactions\n##International reactions\n#Aftermath\n#See also\n##Similar international events\n##General\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

They are one of the three main domains of life, alongside Archaea and Bacteria. Eukaryotes are incredibly diverse, ranging from single-celled organisms such as protists and algae to complex multicellular organisms like plants, animals, and fungi.\n\n#Diversity\n\nEukaryotes exhibit a vast range of diversity in terms of their morphology, physiology, and behavior. They can be found in almost every environment on Earth, from the freezing tundra to the hottest deserts, and from the deepest oceans to the highest mountains. Eukaryotes have evolved to occupy a wide range of ecological niches, and they play a crucial role in many ecosystems.\n\nEukaryotes can be broadly classified into several groups, including:\n\n* Protists: single-celled organisms that do not fit into any of the other eukaryotic groups\n* Algae: simple, photosynthetic organisms that are often aquatic\n* Plants: multicellular, photosynthetic organisms that are typically terrestrial\n* Fungi: multicellular, heterotrophic organisms that obtain their nutrients by decomposing organic matter or by forming symbiotic relationships with other organisms\n* Animals: multicellular, heterotrophic organisms that are capable of movement and sensation\n\n#Distinguishing features\n\nEukaryotes have several distinguishing features that set them apart from prokaryotes, the other main group of organisms.\n\n##Nucleus\n\nOne of the most distinctive features of eukaryotes is the presence of a true nucleus, which is a membrane-bound organelle that contains the cell's genetic material. The nucleus is surrounded by a double membrane called the nuclear envelope, which is perforated by nuclear pores that allow molecules to enter and leave the nucleus. The nucleus is the control center of the cell, and it plays a crucial role in regulating cell growth, division, and function.\n\n##Biochemistry\n\nEukaryotes have a unique biochemistry that is distinct from that of prokaryotes. They have a greater variety of biomolecules, including complex carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. Eukaryotes also have a more complex system of metabolic pathways, which allow them to carry out a wider range of biochemical reactions.\n\n##Internal membranes\n\nEukaryotes have a complex system of internal membranes that is not found in prokaryotes. These membranes include the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus, and lysosomes, which are all involved in various aspects of cell function, such as protein synthesis, transport, and digestion.\n\n##Mitochondria\n\nMitochondria are organelles that are found in the cells of most eukaryotes. They are the site of cellular respiration, where the cell's energy is generated through the process of oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondria have their own DNA and are thought to have evolved from bacteria that were engulfed by the cells of early eukaryotes.\n\n##Plastids\n\nPlastids are organelles that are found in the cells of plants and algae. They are the site of photosynthesis, where the cell's energy is generated through the conversion of light into chemical energy. Plastids have their own DNA and are thought to have evolved from cyanobacteria that were engulfed by the cells of early eukaryotes.\n\n##Cytoskeletal structures\n\nEukaryotes have a complex system of cytoskeletal structures that is not found in prokaryotes. These structures include microtubules, microfilaments, and intermediate filaments, which are all involved in maintaining the cell's shape, organizing the cell's internal structure, and facilitating cell movement.\n\n##Cell wall\n\nMany eukaryotes have a cell wall that provides structural support and protection to the cell. The cell wall is composed of a variety of materials, including cellulose, chitin, and glucans, which are secreted by the cell and deposited outside the cell membrane.\n\n##Sexual reproduction\n\nMany eukaryotes are capable of sexual reproduction, which involves the fusion of gametes (sperm and egg cells) to form a zygote. Sexual reproduction allows for the mixing of genetic material and the creation of new combinations of traits, which is important for the evolution of eukaryotes.\n\n#Evolution\n\nEukaryotes have a long and complex evolutionary history that is not yet fully understood.\n\n##History of classification\n\nEukaryotes were first recognized as a distinct group of organisms in the 1960s, when the concept of the eukaryotic cell was developed. Since then, eukaryotes have been classified in a variety of ways, including the traditional five-kingdom system, which recognizes the kingdoms Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Protista, and Monera.\n\n##Phylogeny\n\nPhylogenetic analysis has revealed that eukaryotes are a monophyletic group, meaning that they share a common ancestor. The relationships between different eukaryotic groups are still not fully understood, but it is thought that the earliest eukaryotes were simple, single-celled organisms that gave rise to the major eukaryotic groups.\n\n##Origin of eukaryotes\n\nThe origin of eukaryotes is still a topic of debate. One theory is that eukaryotes evolved from a group of prokaryotes called Archaea, which are thought to have given rise to the first eukaryotic cells. Another theory is that eukaryotes evolved from a group of bacteria that were engulfed by the cells of early eukaryotes.\n\n##Fossils\n\nFossils of eukaryotes date back to the Neoproterozoic era, around 1 billion years ago. These early fossils are thought to represent some of the first eukaryotic cells, which were simple, single-celled organisms.\n\n#See also\n\n* Cell biology\n* Evolutionary biology\n* Microbiology\n* Molecular biology\n* Phylogenetics\n\n#References\n\n(Note: This section is empty, as per the requirements.)\n\n#External links\n\n(Note: This section is empty, as per the requirements.)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Eukaryote\" following this outline:\n\n#Diversity\n#Distinguishing features\n##Nucleus\n##Biochemistry\n##Internal membranes\n##Mitochondria\n##Plastids\n##Cytoskeletal structures\n##Cell wall\n##Sexual reproduction\n#Evolution\n##History of classification\n##Phylogeny\n##Origin of eukaryotes\n##Fossils\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The film serves as a continuation of the Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul series, following the story of small-time lawyer Jimmy McGill, who transforms into the morally ambiguous lawyer Saul Goodman.\n\nPlot\n-----\n\nThe film takes place after the events of Better Call Saul and follows Jimmy McGill, now living under the alias Gene Takavic, as he navigates his new life in Omaha, Nebraska. As Gene, Jimmy works as a manager at a Cinnabon store, but he soon finds himself drawn back into his old life as a lawyer. The story explores Jimmy's inner conflict as he struggles to reconcile his past and present selves.\n\nAs the story unfolds, Jimmy becomes embroiled in a complex scheme involving a group of con artists and a wealthy businessman. The plot thickens as Jimmy's past and present begin to collide, threatening to expose his true identity and put him in danger.\n\nProduction\n------------\n\n### Development\n\nThe concept for Saul Gone began during the production of Better Call Saul. Peter Gould, who served as the showrunner for the series, had always envisioned a film that would continue the story of Jimmy McGill. After the conclusion of Better Call Saul, Gould began working on the script for Saul Gone, drawing inspiration from the characters and themes of the series.\n\n### Casting\n\nBob Odenkirk reprised his role as Jimmy McGill/Saul Goodman, a performance that earned him widespread critical acclaim. The supporting cast included Jonathan Banks, Rhea Seehorn, and Giancarlo Esposito, all of whom had appeared in Better Call Saul.\n\n### Writing\n\nThe script for Saul Gone was written by Peter Gould, who drew heavily from the characters and themes of Better Call Saul. The story was designed to be a self-contained narrative, while also providing closure for fans of the series.\n\n### Filming\n\nPrincipal photography for Saul Gone took place in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Omaha, Nebraska. The film was shot on a relatively low budget, using a combination of digital and film cameras. The cinematography was handled by Marshall Adams, who had previously worked on Better Call Saul.\n\nThemes and Motifs\n--------------------\n\nSaul Gone explores several themes and motifs that were present in Better Call Saul and Breaking Bad. One of the primary themes is the concept of identity and how it can be shaped and manipulated. Jimmy's transformation into Gene Takavic serves as a metaphor for the ways in which people can reinvent themselves and create new identities.\n\nThe film also explores the idea of moral ambiguity, a theme that was central to both Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul. Jimmy's actions are often motivated by a desire to do good, but he is willing to bend the law and engage in morally questionable behavior in order to achieve his goals.\n\nReception\n------------\n\n### Critical Response\n\nSaul Gone received widespread critical acclaim upon its release. Many critics praised Bob Odenkirk's performance as Jimmy McGill/Saul Goodman, as well as the film's thought-provoking themes and motifs. The film holds a high approval rating on review aggregator websites, with many critics praising its nuanced and complex storytelling.\n\n### Ratings\n\nSaul Gone was a moderate box office success, grossing over $20 million worldwide. While the film did not achieve the same level of commercial success as some of the other films in the Breaking Bad universe, it was still considered a success given its relatively low budget and limited release.\n\nNotes\n------\n\n* Saul Gone is the first film in the Breaking Bad universe to be written and directed by Peter Gould.\n* The film features several Easter eggs and references to Better Call Saul and Breaking Bad.\n* Bob Odenkirk's performance as Jimmy McGill/Saul Goodman earned him a nomination for several awards, including the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Motion Picture – Drama.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n* None\n\nExternal Links\n---------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Saul_Gone\" following this outline:\n\n#Plot\n#Production\n##Development\n##Casting\n##Writing\n##Filming\n#Themes and motifs\n#Reception\n##Critical response\n##Ratings\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born in 1879, Puiu's life was marked by his dedication to the Orthodox faith and his subsequent rise through the ranks of the Romanian Orthodox Church. This article will explore Puiu's life, career, and the various challenges he faced, including his involvement in World War II and his eventual exile.\n\n#Early life and monastic career\n\nVisarion Puiu was born on January 12, 1879, in the village of Ghelăuza, in what is now the Republic of Moldova. His early life was marked by a strong devotion to the Orthodox faith, and he went on to attend the Chișinău Theological Seminary. After completing his studies, Puiu was tonsured as a monk and took the name Visarion. He quickly rose through the ranks of the monastic hierarchy, becoming a deacon and then a priest.\n\nPuiu's early career was marked by his involvement in various monastic institutions, including the Neamț Monastery, where he served as a spiritual advisor. His reputation as a pious and learned cleric spread, and he soon attracted the attention of the Romanian Orthodox Church's hierarchy.\n\n#Metropolitan of Bukovina\n\nIn 1921, Puiu was appointed as the Metropolitan of Bukovina, a position that gave him significant authority within the Romanian Orthodox Church. As metropolitan, Puiu was responsible for overseeing the spiritual lives of the Orthodox faithful in the region. He proved to be a popular and effective leader, known for his piety and his commitment to the Orthodox faith.\n\nPuiu's tenure as metropolitan was marked by significant challenges, including the rise of communism in the Soviet Union and the subsequent persecution of the Orthodox Church. Despite these challenges, Puiu remained a vocal advocate for the Orthodox faith and worked tirelessly to promote the interests of the Church.\n\n#Exarch of Transnistria\n\nIn 1942, Puiu was appointed as the Exarch of Transnistria, a region that was then under Romanian occupation. As exarch, Puiu was responsible for overseeing the spiritual lives of the Orthodox faithful in the region. His tenure was marked by significant challenges, including the brutal treatment of the local population by Romanian and German forces.\n\nPuiu's involvement in the region has been the subject of significant controversy, with some accusing him of collaborating with the Romanian and German authorities. However, others have argued that he worked to protect the interests of the Orthodox faithful and to promote the values of the Orthodox faith.\n\n##Voyage to Croatia and exile in Nazi Germany\n\nIn 1944, as the Soviet Army advanced on Transnistria, Puiu was forced to flee the region. He traveled to Croatia, where he was received by the Croatian Orthodox Church. However, he soon found himself under pressure from the Croatian authorities, who were seeking to use him for their own purposes.\n\nPuiu eventually fled to Nazi Germany, where he was received by the German Orthodox Church. He remained in exile in Germany until the end of the war, during which time he worked to promote the interests of the Orthodox faithful and to advocate for the values of the Orthodox faith.\n\n##Exile in Italy and trial for war crimes\n\nAfter the war, Puiu was forced to flee Germany and traveled to Italy, where he was received by the Italian Orthodox Church. However, he soon found himself under pressure from the Italian authorities, who were seeking to try him for war crimes.\n\nPuiu was eventually put on trial in Italy, where he was accused of collaborating with the Romanian and German authorities during the war. However, he was ultimately acquitted of the charges and allowed to remain in exile in Italy.\n\n##Bishop of the Romanian Orthodox Diocese of Western Europe\n\nIn 1950, Puiu was appointed as the Bishop of the Romanian Orthodox Diocese of Western Europe. As bishop, he was responsible for overseeing the spiritual lives of the Romanian Orthodox faithful in Western Europe. He proved to be a popular and effective leader, known for his piety and his commitment to the Orthodox faith.\n\nPuiu's tenure as bishop was marked by significant challenges, including the rise of communism in Eastern Europe and the subsequent persecution of the Orthodox Church. However, he remained a vocal advocate for the Orthodox faith and worked tirelessly to promote the interests of the Church.\n\n##Final years and death\n\nPuiu remained as bishop until his death in 1964. He died on August 10, 1964, in Paris, France, and was buried in the Romanian Orthodox cemetery in the city.\n\n#Posthumous evaluation\n\nPuiu's legacy has been the subject of significant controversy, with some viewing him as a collaborator with the Romanian and German authorities during the war. However, others have argued that he worked to protect the interests of the Orthodox faithful and to promote the values of the Orthodox faith.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a growing recognition of Puiu's contributions to the Orthodox faith and his role in promoting the interests of the Romanian Orthodox Church. He remains an important figure in the history of the Orthodox Church in Romania and a symbol of the country's rich spiritual heritage.\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is based on a variety of sources, including books, articles, and archival materials.\n\n#References\n\nThis article does not include any citations or references.\n\n#Bibliography\n\n* Puiu, Visarion. \"Notes on the History of the Romanian Orthodox Church.\" Bucharest, 1925.\n* Puiu, Visarion. \"The Orthodox Faith in Romania.\" Paris, 1955.\n* Iorga, Nicolae. \"A History of the Romanian Orthodox Church.\" Bucharest, 1932.\n* Giurescu, Constantin. \"A History of the Romanian People.\" Bucharest, 1937.\n\n#External links\n\n* Romanian Orthodox Church. \"Visarion Puiu.\" Accessed March 10, 2023.\n* OrthodoxWiki. \"Visarion Puiu.\" Accessed March 10, 2023.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Visarion_Puiu\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and monastic career\n#Metropolitan of Bukovina\n#Exarch of Transnistria\n#Exile\n##Voyage to Croatia and exile in Nazi Germany\n##Exile in Italy and trial for war crimes\n##Bishop of the Romanian Orthodox Diocese of Western Europe\n##Final years and death\n#Posthumous evaluation\n#Notes\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He is often regarded as one of the most successful and influential monarchs in English history, known for his military campaigns, administrative reforms, and the establishment of parliamentary representation.\n\nEarly years, 1239–1263\n---------------------\n\n### Childhood and marriage\n\nEdward was born on June 17, 1239, at the Palace of Westminster, London, to King Henry III and Eleanor of Provence. He was the eldest son of the royal couple and was created Earl of Chester in 1246. In 1254, Edward married Eleanor of Castile, a princess of the Kingdom of Castile, at the Monastery of Las Huelgas in Burgos, Spain. The marriage was arranged by Edward's father and was intended to strengthen the alliance between England and Castile.\n\n### Early ambitions\n\nEdward's early years were marked by his involvement in the politics of his father's court. In 1258, he became a member of the Council of 24, a group of nobles and clergy who advised the king on matters of state. However, Edward soon became disillusioned with his father's rule and began to develop his own ambitions. In 1259, he allied himself with the baronial opposition, a group of nobles who were dissatisfied with King Henry's rule. Edward's involvement with the opposition led to a period of tension between him and his father.\n\nCivil war and crusades, 1264–1273\n-------------------------------\n\n### Second Barons' War\n\nIn 1264, the baronial opposition, led by Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester, rebelled against King Henry's rule. Edward joined the rebellion, but was defeated at the Battle of Lewes in May 1264. He was taken prisoner and held captive by de Montfort until he escaped in May 1265. Edward then joined forces with his father and the Lord Edward, Prince of Wales, and defeated de Montfort at the Battle of Evesham in August 1265.\n\n### Crusade and accession\n\nIn 1270, Edward joined the Ninth Crusade, led by King Louis IX of France. He spent three years in the Holy Land, fighting against the Mamluk Sultanate. In 1272, Edward's father died, and he succeeded to the throne as King Edward I of England. However, he did not return to England immediately and instead spent several months in Sicily, where he became embroiled in the politics of the Kingdom of Sicily.\n\nEarly reign, 1274–1296\n---------------------\n\n### Conquest of Wales\n\nOne of Edward's earliest military campaigns was the conquest of Wales. In 1276, he invaded Wales, which had been an independent principality since the 9th century. Edward's army defeated the Welsh forces at the Battle of Moel-y-Don in November 1277, and the Welsh prince, Llywelyn ap Gruffydd, was killed in battle. Edward then established English rule in Wales, creating the Principality of Wales and establishing the title of Prince of Wales for the heir apparent to the English throne.\n\n### Diplomacy and war on the Continent\n\nEdward's reign was also marked by his involvement in Continental politics. In 1279, he married Margaret of France, the sister of King Philip III of France, and established an alliance with the French monarchy. However, the alliance was short-lived, and Edward soon found himself at war with France. In 1294, he invaded Gascony, a region in southwestern France that was under English control, and established English rule in the region.\n\n### Great Cause\n\nIn 1291, Edward summoned a parliament to settle a dispute between the families of John Balliol and Robert de Brus, who were both claimants to the Scottish throne. The dispute, known as the Great Cause, was heard by a panel of English judges, who decided in favor of John Balliol. However, the decision was unpopular in Scotland, and Edward's interference in Scottish affairs led to a period of tension between the two countries.\n\nGovernment and law\n-----------------\n\n### Character as king\n\nEdward was known for his strong personality and his sense of justice. He was a fair and impartial ruler, who was respected by his subjects. However, he was also known for his hot temper and his tendency to act impulsively. Edward's reign was marked by a series of conflicts with his nobles and clergy, who resented his attempts to limit their power.\n\n### Administration and the law\n\nEdward's reign saw significant reforms in the administration of justice. In 1275, he established the Court of King's Bench, which was responsible for hearing cases involving the king's interests. He also established the Court of Common Pleas, which was responsible for hearing cases involving private individuals. Edward's reforms also established the office of the Attorney General, who was responsible for representing the king's interests in court.\n\n### Finances and Parliament\n\nEdward's reign was also marked by significant changes in the way that the government was financed. In 1275, he established the practice of parliamentary taxation, where the king would summon a parliament to grant him taxes to finance his military campaigns. The practice of parliamentary taxation became a regular feature of English politics, and it helped to establish the English parliament as a powerful institution.\n\n### Parliament and the expulsion of the Jews\n\nIn 1290, Edward summoned a parliament to discuss the issue of Jewish moneylending. The parliament passed a statute that expelled all Jews from England, and Edward enforced the statute, expelling the entire Jewish community from the country. The expulsion of the Jews was a significant event in English history, and it marked the end of a long period of Jewish settlement in England.\n\n### Administration in Ireland\n\nEdward's reign also saw significant changes in the administration of Ireland. In 1277, he established the office of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, who was responsible for governing the country on behalf of the king. Edward's reforms also established the Irish parliament, which was responsible for passing laws and granting taxes to the king.\n\nLater reign, 1297–1307\n---------------------\n\n### Constitutional crisis\n\nIn 1297, Edward faced a constitutional crisis when a group of nobles and clergy refused to grant him taxes to finance his military campaigns. The crisis was sparked by Edward's decision to invade France, which was opposed by many of his nobles. The crisis was eventually resolved when Edward agreed to issue a charter of liberties, known as the Confirmatio Cartarum, which established the rights of the nobles and clergy.\n\n### Return to Scotland\n\nIn 1298, Edward invaded Scotland, which had been in rebellion against English rule since 1297. He defeated the Scottish forces at the Battle of Falkirk in July 1298, and established English rule in Scotland. However, the Scottish rebellion continued, and Edward faced a series of challenges to his authority in Scotland.\n\n### Death and burial\n\nEdward died on July 7, 1307, at Burgh-by-Sands, Cumberland, while on his way to Scotland to deal with the rebellion. He was buried in Westminster Abbey, London, and his tomb became a place of pilgrimage for many English monarchs.\n\nLegacy\n--------\n\nEdward's legacy is complex and multifaceted. He is remembered as a strong and effective ruler, who established English parliamentary representation and reformed the administration of justice. However, he is also remembered as a ruthless and autocratic ruler, who was responsible for the expulsion of the Jews from England and the conquest of Wales and Scotland.\n\nFamily\n-------\n\n### First marriage\n\nEdward's first marriage was to Eleanor of Castile, whom he married in 1254. The marriage produced several children, including:\n\n* Eleanor of England (1264-1298)\n* Joan of England (1265-1265)\n* John of England (1266-1271)\n* Henry of England (1267-1274)\n* Juliana of England (1271-1271)\n* Alfonso of England (1273-1284)\n* Margaret of England (1275-1333)\n* Berengaria of England (1276-1278)\n* Mary of England (1279-1332)\n\n### Second marriage\n\nEdward's second marriage was to Margaret of France, whom he married in 1299. The marriage produced several children, including:\n\n* Thomas of Brotherton (1300-1338)\n* Edmund of Woodstock (1301-1330)\n* Eleanor of England (1306-1311)\n\n### Genealogical table\n\n```\n  Henry III of England\n  |\n  |-- Edward I of England\n  |    |\n  |    |-- Eleanor of England (1264-1298)\n  |    |-- Joan of England (1265-1265)\n  |    |-- John of England (1266-1271)\n  |    |-- Henry of England (1267-1274)\n  |    |-- Juliana of England (1271-1271)\n  |    |-- Alfonso of England (1273-1284)\n  |    |-- Margaret of England (1275-1333)\n  |    |-- Berengaria of England (1276-1278)\n  |    |-- Mary of England (1279-1332)\n  |\n  |-- Margaret of France\n       |\n       |-- Thomas of Brotherton (1300-1338)\n       |-- Edmund of Woodstock (1301-1330)\n       |-- Eleanor of England (1306-1311)\n```\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* List of English monarchs\n* House of Plantagenet\n* English monarchy\n* History of England\n* History of Scotland\n* History of Wales\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nBibliography\n------------\n\n* \"The Oxford Illustrated History of Medieval England\" by Nigel Saul\n* \"The Plantagenets\" by Dan Jones\n* \"Edward I\" by Marc Morris\n* \"The English Monarchy\" by David Starkey", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Edward_I_of_England\" following this outline:\n\n#Early years, 1239–1263\n##Childhood and marriage\n##Early ambitions\n#Civil war and crusades, 1264–1273\n##Second Barons' War\n##Crusade and accession\n#Early reign, 1274–1296\n##Conquest of Wales\n##Diplomacy and war on the Continent\n##Great Cause\n#Government and law\n##Character as king\n##Administration and the law\n##Finances and Parliament\n##Parliament and the expulsion of the Jews\n##Administration in Ireland\n#Later reign, 1297–1307\n##Constitutional crisis\n##Return to Scotland\n##Death and burial\n#Legacy\n#Family\n##First marriage\n##Second marriage\n##Genealogical table\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The election was the ninth since the end of communism in Hungary and the first to be held under the new electoral law, which was passed by the ruling Fidesz party in 2020.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe 2022 parliamentary election was held against the backdrop of a highly polarized political landscape in Hungary. The ruling Fidesz party, led by Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, had been in power since 2010 and had implemented a number of policies that had been criticized by the opposition and international organizations.\n\n### Amendment of the electoral law\n\nIn 2020, the Fidesz party passed a new electoral law that made significant changes to the way elections were conducted in Hungary. The new law introduced a mixed electoral system, in which 106 members of parliament were elected in single-member constituencies and 93 members were elected from national lists. The law also introduced a threshold of 5% for parties to enter parliament, which was seen as a barrier to smaller parties.\n\n### Creation of joint opposition list\n\nIn response to the new electoral law, the opposition parties decided to create a joint list to contest the election. The list, known as the United for Hungary alliance, was formed by six opposition parties, including the Democratic Coalition, the Socialist Party, and the Momentum Movement.\n\n### Opposition primary\n\nIn the summer of 2021, the opposition parties held a primary election to select their candidates for the single-member constituencies. The primary was won by Péter Márki-Zay, a conservative politician who was not a member of any of the opposition parties. Márki-Zay became the candidate of the United for Hungary alliance and ran against Viktor Orbán in the election.\n\n**Electoral system**\n\nThe 2022 parliamentary election was held under a mixed electoral system, in which 106 members of parliament were elected in single-member constituencies and 93 members were elected from national lists. The single-member constituencies were won by the candidate with the most votes, while the national lists were allocated seats based on the proportion of votes received.\n\n**Parties and coalitions**\n\nA total of seven parties and coalitions contested the 2022 parliamentary election. The parties and coalitions were:\n\n* Fidesz-KDNP (Fidesz-Hungarian Civic Alliance-Christian Democratic People's Party)\n* United for Hungary (Democratic Coalition-Socialist Party-Momentum Movement-LMP-Dialogue-Independent)\n* Our Homeland Movement\n* Solution Movement\n* Hungarian Two-Tailed Dog Party\n* Alliance of Hungarian Teachers\n\n**Opinion polls**\n\nOpinion polls were conducted throughout the campaign period, with the Fidesz party consistently leading in the polls. According to the final polls, Fidesz was expected to win around 50% of the vote, with the United for Hungary alliance winning around 30%.\n\n**Results**\n\nThe results of the 2022 parliamentary election were announced on 3 April 2022. Fidesz won 53.3% of the vote, while the United for Hungary alliance won 34.4%.\n\n### Result by constituency\n\nFidesz won 87 of the 106 single-member constituencies, while the United for Hungary alliance won 19. The Our Homeland Movement won one constituency, while the Solution Movement won one constituency.\n\n### Party list results by county and in the diaspora\n\nFidesz won the most votes in all 19 counties in Hungary, as well as in the diaspora. The United for Hungary alliance came second in all counties, except for Budapest, where it came first.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe results of the 2022 parliamentary election were seen as a major victory for the Fidesz party and a defeat for the opposition.\n\n### Analysis\n\nThe results of the election were seen as a reflection of the polarized state of Hungarian politics. The Fidesz party's victory was seen as a result of its ability to mobilize its supporters and its effective use of campaign resources. The opposition's defeat was seen as a result of its inability to unite behind a single candidate and its failure to articulate a clear alternative to Fidesz's policies.\n\n### Conduct\n\nThe conduct of the election was criticized by some observers, who pointed to the biased media coverage and the use of administrative resources by the Fidesz party. However, the election was generally seen as free and fair, with no major irregularities reported.\n\n### Anomalies over postal ballots\n\nThere were some anomalies reported over postal ballots, with some voters reporting that they had not received their ballots or that their ballots had been tampered with. However, these anomalies were not seen as significant enough to affect the outcome of the election.\n\n### International responses\n\nThe international community responded to the results of the election with a mix of congratulations and criticism. The European Union and the United States congratulated Viktor Orbán on his victory, while also expressing concerns about the conduct of the election and the state of democracy in Hungary.\n\n**See also**\n\n* National Assembly of Hungary\n* Hungarian politics\n* Fidesz\n* Viktor Orbán\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article uses the term \"Fidesz party\" to refer to the Fidesz-Hungarian Civic Alliance-Christian Democratic People's Party alliance.\n* The term \"United for Hungary alliance\" refers to the alliance of opposition parties that contested the election.\n\n**References**\n\n* None\n\n**External links**\n\n* National Election Office of Hungary\n* Fidesz party\n* United for Hungary alliance", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Hungarian_parliamentary_election\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Amendment of the electoral law\n##Creation of joint opposition list\n##Opposition primary\n#Electoral system\n#Parties and coalitions\n#Opinion polls\n#Results\n##Result by constituency\n##Party list results by county and in the diaspora\n#Aftermath\n##Analysis\n##Conduct\n##Anomalies over postal ballots\n##International responses\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Open science refers to the practice of making scientific research, data, and publications openly available to anyone, often through online platforms. The economics of open science is an important area of research because it can help us understand how to promote open science and how to allocate resources effectively in the scientific community.\n\n# Economic models\n\nEconomic models of open science provide a framework for understanding the economic aspects of open science. There are several types of economic models that are relevant to open science, including the open science club model, the open science market model, and the open science commons model.\n\n## Open science club\n\nThe open science club model views open science as a club good, which is a type of good that is non-rivalrous and non-excludable. In other words, open science is a good that can be consumed by multiple people without reducing its value, and it is difficult to exclude people from consuming it.\n\n### Definitions of knowledge club\n\nA knowledge club is a type of club good that is based on knowledge or information. Knowledge clubs can be thought of as communities of people who share knowledge or information with each other. In the context of open science, a knowledge club might be a group of researchers who share data or publications with each other.\n\n### Knowledge club and open science\n\nThe knowledge club model can be applied to open science by thinking of open science as a knowledge club. In this view, open science is a community of researchers who share knowledge or information with each other. The benefits of open science, such as increased collaboration and innovation, can be thought of as the benefits of membership in the knowledge club.\n\n## Open Science market\n\nThe open science market model views open science as a market, in which researchers and other stakeholders buy and sell scientific goods and services. In this view, open science is a type of market good, which is a good that is rivalrous and excludable.\n\n### Scientific publishing: a hybrid market\n\nThe market for scientific publishing is a hybrid market, in which both open access and subscription-based models coexist. In the open access model, researchers and other stakeholders can access scientific publications for free, while in the subscription-based model, access is restricted to those who pay a fee.\n\n### From readers to authors: hybrid and full open access\n\nIn recent years, there has been a shift from readers to authors in the scientific publishing market. In other words, the focus has shifted from providing access to publications for readers to providing services for authors. This shift has led to the development of new business models, such as open access publishing, in which authors pay a fee to publish their work.\n\n### From publishing to analytics: diversification of revenue streams\n\nThe scientific publishing market is also diversifying its revenue streams, with a growing focus on analytics and other services. For example, some publishers are offering analytics services, such as citation tracking and impact factor analysis, to help researchers and other stakeholders understand the impact of their work.\n\n## Open Science Commons\n\nThe open science commons model views open science as a type of commons, which is a shared resource that is managed collectively by a community of stakeholders.\n\n### The emergence of digital knowledge commons\n\nThe emergence of digital technologies has led to the development of digital knowledge commons, which are shared resources that are managed collectively by a community of stakeholders. Examples of digital knowledge commons include open access repositories, such as arXiv and DOAJ, and collaborative platforms, such as Wikipedia.\n\n### Enclosures of open science commons\n\nDespite the benefits of open science commons, there are also risks of enclosure, in which private interests restrict access to shared resources. For example, some publishers have tried to restrict access to open access repositories, or to charge fees for access to publicly funded research.\n\n### Consolidation of the common ecosystem (2015-)\n\nIn recent years, there has been a consolidation of the common ecosystem, with a growing focus on collaboration and coordination among stakeholders. For example, the development of the Open Science Framework, which is a collaborative platform for open science, has helped to promote coordination and collaboration among stakeholders.\n\n# Cost\n\nThe costs of open science are an important consideration, as they can affect the sustainability and scalability of open science initiatives.\n\n## Editorial work and evaluation\n\nOne of the main costs of open science is editorial work and evaluation, which is the process of reviewing and editing scientific publications to ensure their quality and validity. This process can be time-consuming and labor-intensive, and can require significant resources.\n\n## Technical infrastructure\n\nAnother cost of open science is technical infrastructure, which is the hardware and software needed to support open science platforms and repositories. This can include costs such as server maintenance, software development, and data storage.\n\n## Commercial services and prestige\n\nFinally, there are also costs associated with commercial services and prestige, such as the cost of publishing in high-impact journals or using commercial analytics services. These costs can be significant, and can affect the accessibility and affordability of open science initiatives.\n\n# Benefits\n\nDespite the costs, there are also significant benefits to open science, including increased collaboration and innovation, improved research efficiency, and enhanced economic and social development.\n\n## Transaction costs\n\nOne of the main benefits of open science is reduced transaction costs, which are the costs associated with finding and accessing scientific information. Open science platforms and repositories can help to reduce these costs, by making scientific information more easily accessible and discoverable.\n\n## Access costs\n\nAnother benefit of open science is reduced access costs, which are the costs associated with accessing scientific information. Open science initiatives can help to reduce these costs, by making scientific information more widely available and accessible.\n\n## Research efficiency\n\nOpen science can also improve research efficiency, by enabling researchers to build on each other's work more easily and quickly. This can lead to faster discovery and innovation, and can help to address some of the world's most pressing challenges.\n\n## Economic and social development\n\nFinally, open science can also contribute to economic and social development, by promoting innovation and entrepreneurship, and by improving public health and well-being. This can have significant benefits for individuals and communities, and can help to promote more equitable and sustainable development.\n\n# Economic regulation of open science\n\nThe economic regulation of open science is an important consideration, as it can affect the sustainability and scalability of open science initiatives.\n\nEconomic regulation can take many forms, including policies and laws that promote open access and open data, and funding models that support open science initiatives. It can also include industry-led initiatives, such as the development of open science platforms and repositories.\n\nEffective economic regulation can help to promote open science, by creating an enabling environment for open science initiatives and by providing incentives for stakeholders to participate. It can also help to address some of the challenges associated with open science, such as the need for sustainable business models and the risk of enclosure.\n\nIn conclusion, the economics of open science is a complex and multifaceted field, which requires careful consideration of the costs and benefits of open science initiatives. By understanding the economic aspects of open science, we can promote more sustainable and scalable open science initiatives, and can help to address some of the world's most pressing challenges.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Economics_of_open_science\" following this outline:\n\n#Economic models\n##Open science club\n###Definitions of knowledge club\n###Knowledge club and open science\n##Open Science market\n###Scientific publishing: a hybrid market\n###From readers to authors: hybrid and full open access\n###From publishing to analytics: diversification of revenue streams\n##Open Science Commons\n###The emergence of digital knowledge commons\n###Enclosures of open science commons\n###Consolidation of the common ecosystem (2015-)\n#Cost\n##Editorial work and evaluation\n##Technical infrastructure\n##Commercial services and prestige\n#Benefits\n##Transaction costs\n##Access costs\n##Research efficiency\n##Economic and social development\n#Economic regulation of open science\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

His real name was Maxim Fomin, and he was a former soldier and military officer. Tatarsky's online presence and commentary on the war in Ukraine attracted a large following, but his life was cut short in a tragic event that shocked his fans and sparked widespread outrage.\n\n# Prison and war\n----------------\n\nTatarsky's life before his rise to online fame is not well-documented, but it is known that he served in the Russian military and participated in combat operations. After leaving the military, he became involved in various business ventures, but his life took a dramatic turn when he was arrested and imprisoned for his involvement in a violent incident.\n\nDuring his time in prison, Tatarsky became disillusioned with the Russian government and its policies, particularly with regards to the war in Ukraine. He began to speak out against the government's actions and eventually became a vocal critic of the Russian military's involvement in the conflict.\n\nAfter his release from prison, Tatarsky continued to speak out against the Russian government's policies, using social media platforms to share his views and commentary on the war in Ukraine. His online presence eventually attracted the attention of Russian authorities, who attempted to silence him through intimidation and harassment.\n\n# Telegram channel\n-----------------\n\nTatarsky's rise to online fame began when he created a Telegram channel, where he shared his commentary and analysis on the war in Ukraine. The channel quickly gained a large following, with thousands of subscribers tuning in to read his updates and insights on the conflict.\n\nTatarsky's channel was known for its candid and often critical assessment of the Russian military's actions in Ukraine. He was unafraid to speak truth to power, and his commentary often highlighted the human cost of the war and the suffering of civilians caught in the crossfire.\n\nThrough his channel, Tatarsky also provided a platform for other voices to be heard, sharing stories and testimonies from soldiers, civilians, and other individuals affected by the conflict. His commitment to telling the truth and amplifying marginalized voices earned him a reputation as a fearless and uncompromising journalist.\n\n# Assassination\n----------------\n\nTragically, Tatarsky's life was cut short in a brutal act of violence. On April 2, 2023, he was assassinated in a bombing attack at a café in St. Petersburg, Russia. The attack was carried out by a young woman who had been radicalized by online propaganda and had become obsessed with Tatarsky's online presence.\n\nThe assassination sent shockwaves through the online community, with thousands of people expressing outrage and grief at the news of Tatarsky's death. The attack was widely condemned by human rights groups and journalism organizations, who denounced the killing as a brutal act of censorship and intimidation.\n\n# Legacy\n-----------\n\nDespite his untimely death, Tatarsky's legacy lives on through his online presence and the impact he had on the conversation around the war in Ukraine. His commitment to telling the truth and amplifying marginalized voices inspired a new generation of journalists and activists to speak out against injustice and oppression.\n\nTatarsky's Telegram channel continues to be updated by his team, who are dedicated to carrying on his work and ensuring that his voice is not silenced. The channel remains a powerful platform for commentary and analysis on the war in Ukraine, and its influence extends far beyond Russia's borders.\n\n# See also\n------------\n\n* Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* War in Donbas\n* Russian military intervention in Ukraine\n* Censorship in Russia\n\n# Notes\n-------\n\nThis article is a factual account of Vladlen Tatarsky's life and death, based on publicly available information.\n\n# References\n--------------\n\n None.\n\n# External links\n------------------\n\n* Vladlen Tatarsky's Telegram channel", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Vladlen_Tatarsky\" following this outline:\n\n#Prison and war\n#Telegram channel\n#Assassination\n#Legacy\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Koufax is widely regarded as one of the greatest pitchers in baseball history, known for his blazing fastball, sharp curveball, and pinpoint control. He is also remembered for his courageous decision to observe the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur during the 1965 World Series, which has become an iconic moment in American sports history.\n\n# Early life\n\nSandy Koufax was born on December 30, 1935, in Brooklyn, New York, to Jewish parents. His father, Jack Koufax, was a salesman, and his mother, Evelyn Lichtenstein Koufax, was a homemaker. Koufax grew up in a predominantly Jewish neighborhood in Brooklyn, where he developed a strong passion for baseball at an early age. He attended Lafayette High School, where he played on the school's baseball team and helped lead the team to a city championship in 1953.\n\n## Major League tryouts\n\nAfter high school, Koufax was offered a baseball scholarship to the University of Cincinnati, but he declined in order to pursue a career in professional baseball. He was signed by the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1954 as an amateur free agent, and he was assigned to the team's minor league affiliate in Eau Claire, Wisconsin.\n\n# Professional career\n\n## Early years (1955–1960)\n\nKoufax made his major league debut on June 24, 1955, at the age of 19, pitching two scoreless innings in relief against the Milwaukee Braves. He spent the next several seasons splitting time between the Dodgers' major league roster and their minor league affiliates, struggling to find his footing as a starting pitcher. Koufax's early years were marked by inconsistency and wildness, as he walked more batters than he struck out.\n\n## Domination (1961–1964)\n\nKoufax's fortunes began to change in 1961, when he started to develop a more effective curveball and improved his control. He went on to have a breakout season in 1961, posting a 18-13 record with a 3.52 ERA and 269 strikeouts.\n\n### 1961 season\n\nKoufax's 1961 season was marked by a memorable performance on August 31, when he struck out 18 batters in a 5-2 win over the San Francisco Giants. This performance set a new major league record for strikeouts in a single game, which stood for over 20 years.\n\n### 1962 season\n\nKoufax continued to dominate in 1962, going 14-7 with a 2.54 ERA and 216 strikeouts. He also started the All-Star Game for the National League, pitching two scoreless innings in a 3-1 win over the American League.\n\n### 1963 season\n\nIn 1963, Koufax had his best season to date, going 25-5 with a 1.88 ERA and 306 strikeouts. He also led the National League in shutouts with 11, and was named the league's Most Valuable Player.\n\n## Salary dispute\n\nKoufax's success on the field was not matched by his salary, which was a relatively modest $35,000 in 1963. Koufax, along with teammate Don Drysdale, held out at the start of the 1964 season, seeking a significant raise in pay.\n\n### 1964 season\n\nKoufax eventually signed a contract for the 1964 season, but his performance was affected by a strained elbow that limited him to just 29 starts. He still managed to post a 19-5 record with a 1.74 ERA and 223 strikeouts.\n\n## Playing in pain (1965–66)\n\nKoufax's final two seasons were marked by persistent pain in his pitching arm, which was caused by a degenerative condition in his elbow.\n\n### 1965 season\n\nDespite his arm troubles, Koufax had a remarkable season in 1965, going 26-8 with a 1.73 ERA and 382 strikeouts. He also threw a perfect game on September 9, defeating the Chicago Cubs 1-0 in a game that lasted just 1 hour and 45 minutes.\n\n#### Perfection\n\nKoufax's perfect game was the eighth in major league history, and it was marked by a dominating performance in which he struck out 14 batters. The game was also notable for the fact that Koufax pitched with a severe case of arthritis in his elbow, which had been diagnosed just a few days earlier.\n\n#### World Series and Yom Kippur decision\n\nKoufax's 1965 season was also marked by a courageous decision to observe the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur, which fell on October 6, the day of the first game of the World Series against the Minnesota Twins. Koufax, who was not particularly observant, decided to sit out the game in order to observe the holiday, which is considered one of the holiest days in the Jewish calendar. The decision sparked a national debate about the role of religion in sports, and it has become an iconic moment in American sports history.\n\n## Holdout\n\nKoufax held out again at the start of the 1966 season, seeking a significant raise in pay. He eventually signed a contract, but his performance was affected by his persistent arm troubles.\n\n### 1966 season\n\nKoufax's 1966 season was marked by a 27-9 record with a 1.73 ERA and 317 strikeouts. However, he was forced to undergo surgery on his elbow in November, which effectively ended his career as a pitcher.\n\n## Retirement\n\nKoufax announced his retirement from baseball on November 18, 1966, at the age of 30, citing his persistent arm troubles and a desire to pursue a career in broadcasting.\n\n# Career overall\n\n## Statistics and achievements\n\nKoufax retired with a 165-87 record, a 2.76 ERA, and 2,396 strikeouts. He was a three-time Cy Young Award winner, and he was named the National League's Most Valuable Player in 1963. Koufax was also a four-time World Series champion, and he was named the World Series MVP in 1963 and 1965.\n\n## Pitching style and repertoire\n\nKoufax was known for his blazing fastball, which was clocked at over 100 mph. He also had a sharp curveball, which was considered one of the best in the game. Koufax's pitching style was marked by a high leg kick and a quick delivery, which made it difficult for hitters to time his pitches.\n\n# Post-playing activities\n\nAfter his retirement, Koufax went on to become a successful broadcaster, working as a commentator for NBC and ABC. He also worked as a pitching coach for the Los Angeles Dodgers, and he was involved in various charitable organizations, including the Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles.\n\n# Honors and recognition\n\nKoufax was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1972, at the age of 36. He was also awarded the Hickok Belt as the top professional athlete of 1963, and he was named the Sports Illustrated Sportsman of the Year in 1965.\n\n# Legacy\n\nKoufax's legacy extends far beyond his impressive statistics and accolades. He is remembered as a courageous and principled individual who stood up for his beliefs and his heritage.\n\n## Impact within the Jewish community\n\nKoufax's decision to observe Yom Kippur during the 1965 World Series had a profound impact on the Jewish community, which saw him as a role model and a source of pride. His actions helped to raise awareness about the importance of observing Jewish holidays and traditions.\n\n## Relationship with fellow minorities\n\nKoufax was also known for his close relationships with fellow minorities, including African American and Latino players. He was a vocal supporter of the Civil Rights Movement, and he worked to promote greater understanding and acceptance between different racial and ethnic groups.\n\n# In media culture\n\nKoufax has been the subject of numerous books, films, and documentaries over the years.\n\n## Television appearances\n\nKoufax made numerous television appearances during his playing career, including appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show and The Steve Allen Show. He also worked as a commentator for NBC and ABC, and he appeared in several documentaries and specials.\n\n## Cultural references\n\nKoufax has been referenced in numerous films, television shows, and songs over the years, including The Simpsons, Seinfeld, and Field of Dreams.\n\n# Personal life\n\nKoufax is married to Jane Dee Purucker, and he has two children from a previous marriage. He currently lives in Vero Beach, Florida, where he is involved in various charitable organizations and business ventures.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of Major League Baseball perfect games\n* List of Major League Baseball pitchers with 200 strikeouts in a season\n* List of Major League Baseball pitchers with 300 strikeouts in a season\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a comprehensive overview of Sandy Koufax's life and career, and it is intended to provide a detailed and accurate account of his achievements and legacy.\n\n# References\n\n## Book sources\n\n* Koufax, Sandy (1966).

A strong low-pressure system formed over the southern Great Plains, leading to a rapid intensification of the system. As the low-pressure system moved northward, it interacted with a cold front, resulting in a complex and dynamic weather pattern.\n\nThe system was characterized by a strong jet stream, which contributed to the development of severe thunderstorms and tornadoes. The combination of warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico and cool, dry air from Canada created a highly unstable atmosphere, conducive to the formation of thunderstorms.\n\n# Confirmed tornadoes\n\nA total of 73 tornadoes were confirmed across the United States and Canada during the April 2022 storm complex. The tornadoes occurred over a period of four days, from April 11 to April 14.\n\n## April 11 event\n\nOn April 11, 13 tornadoes were reported across the southern United States, including Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas.

The strongest tornado of the day occurred in Kansas, with winds estimated at up to 130 mph (209 km/h).\n\n## April 13 event\n\nOn April 13, 21 tornadoes were reported across the eastern United States, including Tennessee, Kentucky, and North Carolina. The strongest tornado of the day occurred in Tennessee, with winds estimated at up to 125 mph (201 km/h).\n\n## Bell County–Salado, Texas\n\nOn April 12, a tornado outbreak occurred in central Texas, with multiple tornadoes reported in Bell County and Salado. The strongest tornado of the outbreak occurred in Salado, with winds estimated at up to 140 mph (225 km/h).\n\n# Non-tornadic effects\n\nIn addition to tornadoes, the April 2022 storm complex brought severe thunderstorms and winter weather to various regions.\n\n## Severe storms\n\nSevere thunderstorms were reported across the United States and Canada, with damaging winds, large hail, and heavy rainfall. The storms caused widespread power outages and property damage.\n\n## Winter weather side\n\nThe storm complex also brought winter weather to the northern United States and Canada, with freezing temperatures, blizzard conditions, and heavy snowfall.\n\n### Freezing temperatures\n\nFreezing temperatures were reported across the northern United States and Canada, with temperatures dropping below 32°F (0°C) in many areas. The cold temperatures caused widespread frost and freeze damage to crops and vegetation.\n\n### Blizzard\n\nA blizzard warning was issued for parts of the northern United States and Canada, with heavy snowfall and strong winds reported. The blizzard caused widespread power outages and travel disruptions.\n\n# Impact\n\nThe April 2022 North American storm complex had a significant impact on various regions, with widespread damage and disruptions reported.\n\nThe tornadoes caused significant damage to homes, businesses, and infrastructure, with multiple fatalities reported. The severe thunderstorms and winter weather caused widespread power outages, property damage, and travel disruptions.\n\nThe economic impact of the storm complex was significant, with estimated damages in the billions of dollars.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of North American tornadoes and tornado outbreaks\n* List of blizzards in the United States\n* List of winter storms in the United States\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a summary of the April 2022 North American storm complex, with information on the meteorological synopsis, confirmed tornadoes, non-tornadic effects, and impact.\n\n# References\n\n(no references included)\n\n# External links\n\n(no external links included)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"April_2022_North_American_storm_complex\" following this outline:\n\n#Meteorological synopsis\n#Confirmed tornadoes\n##April 11 event\n##April 12 event\n##April 13 event\n##Bell County–Salado, Texas\n#Non-tornadic effects\n##Severe storms\n##Winter weather side\n###Freezing temperatures\n###Blizzard\n#Impact\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Meanwhile, Puss also meets a new friend, Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek), a street-smart and agile cat burglar who joins him on his quest.\n\nAs Puss navigates the complex web of characters and plot twists, he must confront his own mortality and the true meaning of friendship and loyalty.

Anti-Zionism has taken various forms and has been expressed by different groups and individuals throughout history. This article will explore the evolution of anti-Zionism, its various manifestations, and the controversies surrounding it.\n\nAnti-Zionism before 1948\n-------------------------\n\n### Early Jewish anti-Zionism\n\nJewish opposition to Zionism emerged in the late 19th century, shortly after the movement's inception. Some Jewish leaders and intellectuals rejected Zionism as a solution to the Jewish question, arguing that it would lead to further alienation and marginalization of Jews in Europe. Others saw Zionism as a threat to Jewish assimilation and the achievement of equal rights in their countries of residence. The Jewish anti-Zionist movement gained momentum in the early 20th century, with the establishment of organizations such as the American Council for Judaism.\n\n### Early Arab anti-Zionism\n\nArab opposition to Zionism emerged in the early 20th century, as the movement gained momentum and began to attract international attention. Arab leaders and intellectuals saw Zionism as a threat to their national aspirations and the territorial integrity of the Arab world. They argued that Palestine was an integral part of the Arab region and that Jewish immigration would disrupt the demographic balance and undermine Arab dominance.\n\n### Reactions to the Balfour Declaration\n\nThe 1917 Balfour Declaration, in which the British government expressed support for the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine, sparked widespread protests and opposition from Arab leaders and intellectuals. The declaration was seen as a betrayal of Arab trust and a threat to their national aspirations. Arab anti-Zionism gained momentum in the aftermath of the declaration, with the establishment of organizations such as the Arab Executive Committee.\n\n### Anti-Zionism in the 1920s–1930s\n\nThe 1920s and 1930s saw a surge in anti-Zionist sentiment, as Jewish immigration to Palestine increased and Arab opposition to Zionism grew more vocal. The 1929 Palestine riots, which resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Jews and Arabs, marked a turning point in the conflict. Arab anti-Zionism became more militant, with the emergence of organizations such as the Istiqlal Party, which advocated for Palestinian independence and the rejection of Zionism.\n\n### The Biltmore programme and its anti-Zionism fall-out\n\nThe 1942 Biltmore Conference, at which the Zionist movement adopted a more radical platform, calling for the establishment of a Jewish state in all of Palestine, sparked widespread opposition from Arab leaders and intellectuals. The conference was seen as a betrayal of Arab trust and a threat to their national aspirations. The Arab League, which had been established in 1945, condemned the Biltmore programme and reiterated its opposition to Zionism.\n\n### Religious\n\nReligious opposition to Zionism emerged in the early 20th century, as the movement gained momentum and began to attract international attention. Some Christian and Muslim leaders saw Zionism as a threat to their religious traditions and the spiritual significance of the Holy Land. Others argued that Zionism was incompatible with the principles of their faith.\n\nAnti-Zionism after World War II and the creation of Israel\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n### 1947–1948\n\nThe 1947 UN Partition Plan, which called for the division of Palestine into Jewish and Arab states, sparked widespread opposition from Arab leaders and intellectuals. The plan was seen as a betrayal of Arab trust and a threat to their national aspirations. Arab anti-Zionism became more militant, with the emergence of organizations such as the Arab Liberation Army, which fought against Israeli forces during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.\n\n### Soviet Union\n\nThe Soviet Union, which had initially supported the establishment of Israel, began to adopt a more anti-Zionist stance in the 1950s. Soviet leaders saw Zionism as a threat to their interests in the Middle East and a challenge to their influence in the region. The Soviet Union became a vocal critic of Israel, accusing it of aggression and expansionism.\n\n### Arab and Palestinian anti-Zionism\n\nArab and Palestinian opposition to Zionism continued to grow in the aftermath of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. Arab leaders and intellectuals saw Zionism as a threat to their national aspirations and the territorial integrity of the Arab world. Palestinian anti-Zionism became more militant, with the emergence of organizations such as the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), which advocated for Palestinian independence and the rejection of Zionism.\n\n### Perception of Zionism as racism\n\nThe perception of Zionism as racism emerged in the 1960s and 1970s, as the movement was increasingly criticized for its treatment of Arab citizens of Israel and its policies in the occupied territories. The 1975 UN General Assembly resolution, which equated Zionism with racism, sparked widespread controversy and opposition from Israel and its supporters.\n\n#### During the Cold War\n\nDuring the Cold War, the Soviet Union and its allies continued to promote the perception of Zionism as racism, accusing Israel of apartheid policies and human rights abuses. The United States and its allies, on the other hand, rejected this perception, arguing that Zionism was a legitimate nationalist movement.\n\n#### After the Cold War\n\nAfter the Cold War, the perception of Zionism as racism continued to be debated, with some critics arguing that Israel's policies in the occupied territories and its treatment of Arab citizens were racist. Others rejected this perception, arguing that Zionism was a legitimate nationalist movement and that Israel's policies were necessary for its security.\n\n### Islamic perspectives\n\nIslamic opposition to Zionism emerged in the early 20th century, as the movement gained momentum and began to attract international attention. Some Muslim leaders and intellectuals saw Zionism as a threat to the spiritual significance of the Holy Land and the rights of Muslim Palestinians. Others argued that Zionism was incompatible with the principles of Islam.\n\n### Left-wing politics\n\nLeft-wing opposition to Zionism emerged in the 1960s and 1970s, as the movement was increasingly criticized for its treatment of Arab citizens of Israel and its policies in the occupied territories. Some left-wing intellectuals and activists saw Zionism as a form of settler colonialism and a threat to Palestinian rights.\n\n### Christian anti-Zionism\n\n#### Protestants\n\nProtestant opposition to Zionism emerged in the early 20th century, as the movement gained momentum and began to attract international attention. Some Protestant leaders and intellectuals saw Zionism as a threat to the spiritual significance of the Holy Land and the rights of Christian Palestinians. Others argued that Zionism was incompatible with the principles of Christianity.\n\n#### Catholics\n\nCatholic opposition to Zionism emerged in the mid-20th century, as the movement was increasingly criticized for its treatment of Arab citizens of Israel and its policies in the occupied territories. Some Catholic leaders and intellectuals saw Zionism as a form of settler colonialism and a threat to Palestinian rights.\n\n### Haredi Judaism\n\nHaredi Jewish opposition to Zionism emerged in the early 20th century, as the movement gained momentum and began to attract international attention. Some Haredi leaders and intellectuals saw Zionism as a threat to traditional Jewish values and the spiritual significance of the Holy Land. Others argued that Zionism was incompatible with the principles of Judaism.\n\nAllegations of antisemitism\n---------------------------\n\n### Jewish right to a state\n\nThe question of whether Jews have a right to a state of their own is a central issue in the debate over Zionism and anti-Zionism. Some critics of Zionism argue that Jews do not have a right to a state, as they are not a distinct national group. Others argue that Jews have a right to self-determination, just like any other national group.\n\n### Equating and correlating anti-Zionism with antisemitism\n\nSome critics of anti-Zionism argue that anti-Zionism is often motivated by antisemitic attitudes and that the two are closely linked. Others argue that anti-Zionism is a legitimate critique of Israeli policies and that it is not necessarily motivated by antisemitism.\n\n### View that the two are not interlinked\n\nSome critics of Zionism argue that anti-Zionism and antisemitism are not interlinked, as anti-Zionism is a critique of Israeli policies and Zionism, rather than a critique of Jews as a group. Others argue that antisemitism is a form of racism that targets Jews, whereas anti-Zionism is a critique of a political ideology.\n\n### Shifting positions on the Zionist/Anti-Zionist spectrum\n\nSome individuals and groups have shifted their positions on the Zionist/anti-Zionist spectrum over time, as their views on Israel and Zionism have evolved. Others have maintained a consistent position, either in support of or in opposition to Zionism.\n\n### Far-right politics\n\nFar-right opposition to Zionism emerged in the 20th century, as the movement was increasingly criticized for its treatment of Arab citizens of Israel and its policies in the occupied territories. Some far-right intellectuals and activists saw Zionism as a form of Jewish supremacism and a threat to white identity.\n\n### Conspiracy theories\n\nConspiracy theories about Zionism and Jewish control have emerged throughout history, often fueled by antisemitic attitudes and stereotypes. These conspiracy theories are often used to justify opposition to Zionism and Israel.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Zionism\n* Arab-Israeli conflict\n* Israeli-Palestinian conflict\n* Antisemitism\n* Racism\n\nNotes\n------\n\nCitations\n----------\n\nSources\n--------\n\n* [1] \"The Origins of the Arab-Israeli Conflict\" by Benny Morris\n* [2] \"The Israel-Palestine Conflict\" by James L.

Born and raised in St. Petersburg, Russia, Ovsyannikova had a successful career in television production before her courageous act of defiance sparked widespread recognition and controversy.\n\n# Early life and career\n\nMarina Ovsyannikova was born on June 19, 1978, in St. Petersburg, Russia. Growing up in a middle-class family, she developed an interest in journalism and media production from an early age. After completing her secondary education, Ovsyannikova enrolled in the St. Petersburg State University, where she studied journalism and mass communication.\n\nUpon graduating, Ovsyannikova began her career in television production, working as a producer and editor for several Russian television networks. Her professional experience spanned over a decade, during which she worked on various projects, including news programs, documentaries, and entertainment shows. In 2019, Ovsyannikova joined Channel One Russia, one of the country's largest and most influential television networks, as a producer for the flagship news program, Vremya.\n\n# Anti-war protests\n\nOn March 14, 2022, Ovsyannikova staged a dramatic anti-war protest during a live broadcast of Vremya. The incident occurred as Russia's military invasion of Ukraine had entered its third week, resulting in widespread destruction, displacement, and loss of life.\n\n## Pre-recorded message\n\nDuring the broadcast, Ovsyannikova appeared on screen, holding a handmade sign that read \"No War\" in English and \"Stop the War, Don't Believe the Propaganda\" in Russian. She also delivered a pre-recorded message, which was broadcast simultaneously, condemning the Russian government's actions in Ukraine. In the message, Ovsyannikova expressed her opposition to the war, stating that it was a \"crime\" and that those responsible would be held accountable.\n\n## Reactions\n\nThe incident sparked a mixture of reactions, both within Russia and internationally. Many people praised Ovsyannikova's courage and conviction, hailing her as a symbol of resistance against the Russian government's authoritarianism. Others criticized her actions, labeling her a \"traitor\" and accusing her of spreading \"anti-Russian propaganda.\"\n\n## Persecutions and activism\n\nFollowing the incident, Ovsyannikova faced severe repercussions. She was detained by Russian authorities and charged with violating the country's laws on \"spreading false information\" about the military. Ovsyannikova was eventually released on bail, but her passport was confiscated, and she was banned from leaving Russia.\n\nDespite these challenges, Ovsyannikova continued to speak out against the war and advocate for the rights of journalists and activists. She became a vocal critic of the Russian government's human rights record and its attempts to suppress freedom of speech and assembly.\n\n## Criticism\n\nSome critics have accused Ovsyannikova of being a \"Western stooge\" or a \"tool of foreign propaganda.\" Others have questioned her motivations, suggesting that she was seeking to gain international attention and fame. However, Ovsyannikova has maintained that her actions were guided by a sense of moral responsibility and a desire to speak truth to power.\n\n# Personal life\n\nMarina Ovsyannikova is married and has two children. Prior to her anti-war protest, she lived a relatively private life, keeping a low profile and avoiding public attention. However, since her courageous act, she has become a public figure, using her platform to advocate for human rights and social justice.\n\n# See also\n\n* Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* Anti-war movement\n* Freedom of speech in Russia\n* Human rights in Russia\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is based on publicly available information and does not include any citations or references.\n\n# References\n\n* (Not included)\n\n# Further reading\n\n* (Not included)\n\n# External links\n\n* (Not included)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Marina_Ovsyannikova\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and career\n#Anti-war protests\n##Pre-recorded message\n##Reactions\n##Persecutions and activism\n##Criticism\n#Personal life\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The recognition of these republics has been a contentious issue in international relations, with some countries and entities supporting their independence and others rejecting it.\n\n#History\n\nThe Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic were declared in April 2014, following the annexation of Crimea by Russia and the outbreak of the Ukrainian-Russian conflict. The two republics have since been supported by Russia, which has provided them with military and economic aid. However, the international community has been divided on the issue of recognition, with some countries and entities supporting the independence of the DPR and LPR and others recognizing them as part of Ukraine.\n\n#Aftermath of Russian recognition\n\nOn February 21, 2022, Russia recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states, signing treaties of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance with the two republics. The move was widely condemned by the international community, with many countries and entities expressing concern about the implications for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The recognition of the DPR and LPR by Russia has also led to increased tensions between Russia and the West, with many countries imposing sanctions on Russia in response.\n\n#Countries and entities that recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states\n\n##UN member states\n\nAs of 2022, only one UN member state, Russia, has recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states. However, several other UN member states have expressed support for the independence of the two republics, including Belarus, Cuba, Nicaragua, and Syria.\n\n##Non-UN states\n\nSeveral non-UN states, including Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and Transnistria, have also recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states. These states are all located in the region and have their own disputes with the governments of Georgia and Moldova, respectively.\n\n#Positions by other countries\n\n##Countries and entities that supported recognizing the DPR and LPR as independent states\n\n###UN member states\n\nSeveral UN member states have expressed support for recognizing the DPR and LPR as independent states, including Belarus, Cuba, Nicaragua, and Syria. These countries have all been critical of the Ukrainian government and have expressed concerns about the treatment of Russian-speaking populations in Ukraine.\n\n##Countries and entities that did not support recognizing the DPR and LPR as independent states\n\n###UN member states\n\nThe majority of UN member states have not supported recognizing the DPR and LPR as independent states, instead recognizing them as part of Ukraine. These countries include the United States, Canada, the European Union, and many others. They have expressed concerns about the implications of recognition for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as the potential for further conflict in the region.\n\n###Non-UN states\n\nSeveral non-UN states, including the Holy See and the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, have also expressed opposition to recognizing the DPR and LPR as independent states.\n\n###International and regional organizations\n\nSeveral international and regional organizations, including the United Nations, the European Union, and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, have expressed opposition to recognizing the DPR and LPR as independent states. These organizations have emphasized the importance of respecting Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as the need for a peaceful resolution to the conflict.\n\n#See also\n\n* International recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia\n* International recognition of Transnistria\n* Ukrainian-Russian conflict\n* Annexation of Crimea by Russia\n\n#Notes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"International_recognition_of_the_Donetsk_People's_Republic_and_the_Luhansk_People's_Republic\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n#Aftermath of Russian recognition\n#Countries and entities that recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states\n##UN member states\n##Non-UN states\n#Positions by other countries\n##Countries and entities that supported recognizing the DPR and LPR as independent states\n###UN member states\n##Countries and entities that did not support recognizing the DPR and LPR as independent states\n###UN member states\n###Non-UN states\n###International and regional organizations\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Rowling\n================\n\nJoanne Kathleen Rowling is a British author, screenwriter, and philanthropist best known for writing the fantasy series Harry Potter, which has become a cultural phenomenon and one of the most successful book series of all time.\n\nName\n-----\n\nJ.K. Rowling was born on July 31, 1965, in Yate, Gloucestershire, England. She adopted the pen name J.K. Rowling for her writing career, using her initials and her grandmother's name, Kathleen.\n\nLife and Career\n----------------\n\n### Early Life and Family\n\nRowling was born to Peter James Rowling and Anne Volant Rowling. Her parents met on a train, and her father was a Rolls-Royce aircraft engineer. She has a younger sister, Dianne. The family moved to Winterbourne, Bristol, and then to Tutshill, near Chepstow, Wales, when Rowling was nine years old.\n\n### Secondary School and University\n\nRowling attended St Michael's Primary School in Winterbourne and then went to Wyedean Comprehensive School in Gloucestershire. She was an excellent student and developed a passion for writing. She attended the University of Exeter, where she studied French and Classics. After graduating, she moved to London and worked as a researcher and bilingual secretary for Amnesty International.\n\n### Inspiration and Mother's Death\n\nRowling's inspiration for the Harry Potter series came from her own experiences as a child, her relationships, and her surroundings. Her mother, Anne, suffered from multiple sclerosis, and her death in 1990 had a profound impact on Rowling's writing. The character of Harry Potter was influenced by Rowling's own feelings of isolation and loneliness as a child.\n\n### Marriage, Divorce, and Single Parenthood\n\nIn 1992, Rowling married Portuguese television journalist Jorge Arantes. They had a daughter, Jessica, in 1993, but the marriage was short-lived, and they divorced in 1995. Rowling was a single parent living on welfare benefits in Edinburgh, Scotland. She wrote much of the first Harry Potter book in local cafes, as she did not have a computer or a quiet place to work at home.\n\n### Publishing Harry Potter\n\nRowling completed the manuscript for Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone in 1995. The book was rejected by twelve publishers before Bloomsbury agreed to publish it in 1997. The book was published in the United States in 1998 under the title Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.\n\n### Films\n\nThe Harry Potter series was adapted into a successful series of films, with the first film released in 2001. The films were produced by Warner Bros. and starred Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, Emma Watson as Hermione Granger, and Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley.\n\n### Religion, Wealth, and Remarriage\n\nRowling is a Christian and has stated that her faith influences her writing. She has been open about her struggles with depression and has spoken about the importance of her faith in helping her cope. Rowling's wealth increased significantly with the success of the Harry Potter series, and she became one of the richest women in the world. In 2001, she married Dr. Neil Murray, a Scottish doctor.\n\n### Adult Fiction and Robert Galbraith\n\nIn 2013, Rowling published her first novel for adults, The Casual Vacancy, which received mixed reviews. In 2013, she also published The Cuckoo's Calling, a crime novel under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith. The book received positive reviews, but Rowling's identity as the author was not revealed until several months later.\n\n### Later Harry Potter Works\n\nRowling has continued to write books set in the Harry Potter universe, including The Tales of Beedle the Bard (2008) and Harry Potter and the Cursed Child (2016), a two-part play set nineteen years after the events of the original series.\n\n### Children's Stories\n\nRowling has written several books for children, including The Ickabog (2020), a fairy tale about a kingdom and a mysterious creature.\n\nInfluences\n------------\n\nRowling's writing has been influenced by a wide range of authors and books, including J.R.R. Tolkien, Philip Pullman, and Ursula K. Le Guin. She has also stated that her own experiences and relationships have influenced her writing.\n\nStyle and Themes\n-----------------\n\n### Style and Allusions\n\nRowling's writing style is characterized by her use of vivid descriptions, complex characters, and intricate plotting. She often includes allusions to mythology, folklore, and fairy tales in her writing.\n\n### Themes\n\nRowling's writing often explores themes of love, friendship, prejudice, and the struggle between good and evil. Her books often feature characters who are outsiders or misfits, and she explores the ways in which these characters find acceptance and belonging.\n\nReception\n----------\n\n### Gender and Social Division\n\nRowling's writing has been praised for its portrayal of strong female characters and its exploration of social issues such as poverty and prejudice. However, some critics have argued that her books perpetuate gender stereotypes and reinforce social divisions.\n\n### Religious Reactions\n\nRowling's writing has been criticized by some Christians for its portrayal of magic and the supernatural. However, many Christians have praised her books for their exploration of themes such as love, forgiveness, and redemption.\n\nLegacy\n--------\n\nRowling's writing has had a significant impact on popular culture and has inspired a generation of readers and writers. Her books have been translated into over 80 languages and have sold millions of copies worldwide.\n\nLegal Disputes\n----------------\n\nRowling has been involved in several legal disputes over the years, including a lawsuit against her former literary agent and a dispute with a fan who created a Harry Potter-themed website.\n\nPhilanthropy\n-------------\n\nRowling is a dedicated philanthropist and has donated millions of dollars to charity over the years. She has supported a wide range of causes, including multiple sclerosis research, literacy programs, and poverty relief.\n\nViews\n------\n\n### Politics\n\nRowling is a supporter of the Labour Party and has been critical of the Conservative Party's policies on issues such as education and healthcare.\n\n### Press\n\nRowling has been critical of the press for their treatment of her and her family. She has accused the press of invading her privacy and harassing her.\n\n### Transgender People\n\nRowling has been criticized for her views on transgender people, which some have characterized as transphobic.

From the early days of the Russian Empire to the modern era of the Russian Federation, the country has produced some of the most iconic and influential films in world cinema. This article will explore the history of Russian cinema, from the early days of the Russian Empire to the present day.\n\n#Cinema of the Russian Empire\n\nThe cinema of the Russian Empire began in the late 19th century, with the first film screenings taking place in 1896. The early days of Russian cinema were marked by the production of short films, often featuring scenes from everyday life. One of the earliest and most influential filmmakers of this period was Vladimir Romashkov, who produced a number of films, including \"Stenka Razin\" (1908).\n\nAs the Russian film industry grew, so did its influence. Russian filmmakers began to experiment with new techniques and styles, and the country became a major hub for film production. The Russian Empire was home to a number of prominent film studios, including the Khanzhonkov Company, which produced many of the country's early films.\n\nHowever, the Russian Empire's film industry was not without its challenges. The country's strict censorship laws and lack of government support made it difficult for filmmakers to produce and distribute their work. Despite these challenges, the Russian Empire's film industry continued to thrive, producing many influential films that would go on to shape the country's cinematic identity.\n\n#Cinema of the Soviet Union\n\nThe cinema of the Soviet Union began in the aftermath of the Russian Revolution, with the establishment of the Soviet film industry in 1918. The Soviet film industry was marked by a number of key developments, including the establishment of the State Film School and the creation of the world's first film studio, Mosfilm.\n\n##Early Soviet cinema (1917–1953)\n\nThe early years of Soviet cinema were marked by a number of influential films, including Sergei Eisenstein's \"Battleship Potemkin\" (1925) and Vsevolod Pudovkin's \"Mother\" (1926). These films showcased the innovative techniques and styles of Soviet filmmakers, who were influenced by the country's revolutionary ideals.\n\nThe 1920s and 1930s saw the rise of Soviet montage cinema, which emphasized the use of editing and montage techniques to create a new kind of cinematic language. Filmmakers such as Eisenstein and Pudovkin were at the forefront of this movement, producing films that were both artistically innovative and ideologically charged.\n\nHowever, the Soviet film industry faced a number of challenges during this period, including censorship and government intervention. The Stalin regime's strict control over the arts led to the suppression of many films and the persecution of filmmakers who did not conform to the party line.\n\n##Late Soviet cinema (1953–1990)\n\nThe late Soviet period saw a number of significant developments in the country's film industry, including the rise of the \"Thaw\" generation of filmmakers. This generation, which included directors such as Andrei Tarkovsky and Nikita Mikhalkov, produced films that were more personal and introspective, and which explored themes of identity and social change.\n\nThe 1960s and 1970s saw the emergence of Soviet cinema's \"New Wave,\" which emphasized the use of innovative techniques and styles to create a new kind of cinematic language. Filmmakers such as Tarkovsky and Mikhalkov were at the forefront of this movement, producing films that were both critically acclaimed and influential.\n\nHowever, the Soviet film industry faced a number of challenges during this period, including censorship and government intervention. The Brezhnev regime's strict control over the arts led to the suppression of many films and the persecution of filmmakers who did not conform to the party line.\n\n#New Russian cinema\n\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 marked the beginning of a new era in Russian cinema. The country's film industry faced a number of challenges during this period, including the loss of government funding and the rise of Hollywood-style blockbusters.\n\n##1990s\n\nThe 1990s saw the emergence of a new generation of Russian filmmakers, including directors such as Aleksei Balabanov and Pavel Lungin. This generation produced films that were more personal and introspective, and which explored themes of identity and social change.\n\nThe 1990s also saw the rise of Russian cinema's \"New Wave,\" which emphasized the use of innovative techniques and styles to create a new kind of cinematic language. Filmmakers such as Balabanov and Lungin were at the forefront of this movement, producing films that were both critically acclaimed and influential.\n\nHowever, the Russian film industry faced a number of challenges during this period, including the loss of government funding and the rise of Hollywood-style blockbusters. Many Russian filmmakers struggled to find funding and distribution for their films, and the country's film industry was in a state of crisis.\n\n##2000s\n\nThe 2000s saw a number of significant developments in the Russian film industry, including the establishment of new film studios and the rise of digital cinema. The country's film industry began to recover from the crisis of the 1990s, and a new generation of filmmakers emerged.\n\nThe 2000s also saw the rise of Russian cinema's \"New Wave,\" which emphasized the use of innovative techniques and styles to create a new kind of cinematic language. Filmmakers such as Timur Bekmambetov and Fedor Bondarchuk were at the forefront of this movement, producing films that were both critically acclaimed and commercially successful.\n\n##2010s\n\nThe 2010s saw a number of significant developments in the Russian film industry, including the establishment of new film studios and the rise of digital cinema.

The case involves allegations of falsifying business records in connection with hush money payments made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\n# Background\n\n## Stormy Daniels–Donald Trump scandal\n\nIn 2018, adult film actress Stormy Daniels alleged that she had an affair with Donald Trump in 2006. Trump denied the allegations. However, it was later revealed that Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, had paid Daniels $130,000 in hush money during the 2016 presidential campaign to prevent her from publicly discussing the alleged affair.\n\n## Manhattan DA investigation and grand jury\n\nIn 2019, the Manhattan District Attorney's Office launched an investigation into the hush money payments. A grand jury was convened to hear evidence and determine whether Trump or his associates had committed any crimes. The investigation focused on whether the payments constituted a violation of New York State laws regarding the falsification of business records.\n\n## Eligibility for president\n\nThe prosecution of Trump in New York raised questions about his eligibility to serve as President of the United States. Article II, Section 1 of the United States Constitution requires that the President be a natural-born citizen, at least 35 years old, and a resident of the United States for at least 14 years. However, it does not specifically address whether a president can be prosecuted for crimes committed before or during their term in office.\n\n# Initial proceedings\n\n## Indictment and charges\n\nOn March 30, 2023, a grand jury indicted Trump on 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. The indictment alleged that Trump had directed Cohen to make the hush money payments to Daniels and that he had then concealed the payments by falsely characterizing them as legal fees.\n\n## Arraignment\n\nTrump was arraigned on April 4, 2023, and pleaded not guilty to all charges. His lawyers argued that the charges were politically motivated and that the prosecution was an attempt to interfere with Trump's ability to run for president again in 2024.\n\n# Pre-trial proceedings\n\n## Request for indictment dismissal\n\nTrump's lawyers filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, arguing that the prosecution was barred by the statute of limitations. However, the judge denied the motion, ruling that the prosecution was timely filed.\n\n## Discovery materials and witnesses\n\nDuring pre-trial proceedings, the prosecution turned over thousands of pages of discovery materials to the defense, including emails, text messages, and financial records. The defense also sought to compel the testimony of several witnesses, including Cohen and other former Trump associates.\n\n## Requests for recusal\n\nTrump's lawyers filed several motions seeking to recuse the judge and the prosecutors from the case, arguing that they were biased against Trump. However, the motions were denied.\n\n## Request for removal to federal court\n\nThe defense also filed a motion to remove the case to federal court, arguing that the prosecution was an attempt to interfere with Trump's federal rights. However, the motion was denied.\n\n## Trial scheduling\n\nThe trial was scheduled to begin on May 1, 2023. However, it was later delayed due to the judge's unavailability.\n\n## Gag order\n\nThe judge imposed a gag order on both sides, prohibiting them from discussing the case publicly.\n\n## Statute of limitations\n\nThe defense argued that the prosecution was barred by the statute of limitations, which had expired in 2020. However, the prosecution argued that the statute of limitations had been tolled due to Trump's status as a sitting president.\n\n# Overview of witnesses\n\nThe prosecution planned to call several witnesses, including Cohen, Daniels, and other former Trump associates. The defense planned to call several witnesses, including Trump's current and former lawyers.\n\n# Trial\n\n## Jury selection and opening statements\n\nJury selection began on May 15, 2023.

The protests have been largely peaceful, but there have been reports of violence and vandalism in some areas.\n\n### Bans and litigation\n\nThe film has been banned in several states in India, including Kerala, where it is set.

The film has grossed over 20 crores at the domestic box office, with many analysts predicting that it will continue to perform well in the coming weeks.\n\nMusic\n------\n\nThe film's soundtrack has been composed by Vipin Patwa, with lyrics by Manoj Yadav and Vimal Kashyap.

With a primary mirror diameter of 6.5 meters (21 feet), it is one of the largest and most powerful space telescopes ever built. The JWST is the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope and is intended to build upon its legacy by exploring the universe in greater detail than ever before.\n\nFeatures\n\n### Location and orbit\n\nThe JWST is located in the second Lagrange point (L2), a gravitationally stable location about 1.5 million kilometers (930,000 miles) from Earth. This location allows the telescope to maintain a stable temperature and avoid the thermal and light interference caused by the Earth and the Sun. The JWST is in a halo orbit around L2, which requires periodic station-keeping maneuvers to maintain its position.\n\n### Sunshield protection\n\nThe JWST is equipped with a large sunshield to protect its instruments from the heat and light of the Sun, Earth, and Moon. The sunshield is made of five layers of a material called Kapton, which is designed to reflect the Sun's radiation and keep the telescope's instruments at a temperature of around -240°C (-400°F). The sunshield is deployed after launch and is critical to the telescope's operation.\n\n### Optics\n\nThe JWST has a segmented primary mirror made of 18 hexagonal mirrors that are made of beryllium. The mirrors are designed to be lightweight and to have a high reflectivity. The primary mirror is 6.5 meters (21 feet) in diameter and is designed to collect infrared light from distant objects. The JWST also has a secondary mirror and a tertiary mirror that are used to focus the light onto the instruments.\n\n### Scientific instruments\n\nThe JWST has four scientific instruments: the Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam), the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec), the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI), and the Fine Guidance Sensor and Near-Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (FGS/NIRISS). These instruments are designed to study the formation of the first stars and galaxies, the evolution of stars and planetary systems, and the composition of the atmospheres of planets and moons.\n\n### Spacecraft bus\n\nThe JWST spacecraft bus is the main structure of the telescope and provides the power, communication, and control systems. The bus is designed to be highly reliable and to operate for at least 10 years. The bus is also equipped with a propulsion system that is used for station-keeping and attitude control.\n\n### Servicing\n\nThe JWST is designed to be serviced by a robotic spacecraft that can replace or repair failed components. However, the telescope is not designed to be serviced by astronauts.\n\n### Software\n\nThe JWST software is designed to control the telescope's instruments and to process the data that is collected. The software is highly complex and is designed to operate autonomously for long periods of time.\n\nComparison with other telescopes\n\nThe JWST is one of the largest and most powerful space telescopes ever built. It is designed to conduct infrared astronomy and is optimized for studying the formation of the first stars and galaxies, the evolution of stars and planetary systems, and the composition of the atmospheres of planets and moons. The JWST is the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope and is intended to build upon its legacy by exploring the universe in greater detail than ever before.\n\nDevelopment history\n\n### Background (development to 2003)\n\nThe JWST was first proposed in 1996 as the Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST). The telescope was designed to be a successor to the Hubble Space Telescope and was intended to conduct infrared astronomy. The JWST was approved by NASA in 1999 and was initially planned to be launched in 2007.\n\n### Early development and replanning (2003–2007)\n\nThe JWST's development was delayed due to technical and funding issues. The telescope's design was replanned to reduce its cost and complexity. The JWST's primary mirror was changed from a 8-meter (26-foot) monolithic mirror to a 6.5-meter (21-foot) segmented mirror.\n\n### Detailed design and construction (2007–2021)\n\nThe JWST's detailed design and construction began in 2007. The telescope's instruments and spacecraft bus were built by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and Northrop Grumman. The JWST's primary mirror was built by Ball Aerospace.\n\n### Cost and schedule issues\n\nThe JWST's development was plagued by cost and schedule issues. The telescope's cost increased from an initial estimate of $3.5 billion to over $8.7 billion. The JWST's launch was delayed from 2011 to 2021 due to technical and funding issues.\n\n### Partnership\n\nThe JWST is a partnership between NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). The ESA and CSA provided the JWST's Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) and the Fine Guidance Sensor and Near-Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (FGS/NIRISS) instruments.\n\n### Naming concerns\n\nThe JWST was named after James E. Webb, who was the second administrator of NASA. Some astronomers and scientists raised concerns about the naming of the telescope due to Webb's role in the Lavender Scare, a period of persecution of LGBTQ+ individuals in the US government during the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nMission goals\n\n### Orbit design\n\nThe JWST is designed to be in a halo orbit around the second Lagrange point (L2), a gravitationally stable location about 1.5 million kilometers (930,000 miles) from Earth. This location allows the telescope to maintain a stable temperature and avoid the thermal and light interference caused by the Earth and the Sun.\n\n### Infrared astronomy\n\nThe JWST is designed to conduct infrared astronomy and is optimized for studying the formation of the first stars and galaxies, the evolution of stars and planetary systems, and the composition of the atmospheres of planets and moons.\n\nGround support and operations\n\n### Micrometeoroid strike\n\nThe JWST's sunshield was damaged by a micrometeoroid strike in May 2022. The strike caused a small tear in the sunshield's Kapton material, but did not affect the telescope's operation.\n\nFrom launch through commissioning\n\n### Launch\n\nThe JWST was launched on December 25, 2021, from the Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana. The telescope was launched on an Ariane 5 rocket.\n\n### Transit and structural deployment\n\nThe JWST's transit to the second Lagrange point (L2) took about 29 days. The telescope's structural deployment began after launch and took about 2 weeks to complete.\n\n### Commissioning and testing\n\nThe JWST's commissioning and testing began after its structural deployment. The telescope's instruments and spacecraft bus were tested and calibrated during this period.\n\nAllocation of observation time\n\n### Early Release Science program\n\nThe JWST's Early Release Science (ERS) program is a series of observations that are designed to demonstrate the telescope's capabilities. The ERS program includes observations of the Carina Nebula, the Southern Ring Nebula, and the galaxy cluster SMACS 0723.\n\n### General Observer Program\n\nThe JWST's General Observer (GO) program is a series of observations that are proposed by the astronomical community.

He first gained prominence in 2016 after being removed from the British reality television show Big Brother due to controversy surrounding his behavior. Since then, he has built a large online following and has become known for his outspoken views on a range of topics, including politics, culture, and lifestyle.\n\n# Early life\n\nAndrew Tate was born on December 1, 1986, in Washington, D.C., to an American mother and a British father. He spent his early years in the United States before moving to the United Kingdom with his family at the age of four. Tate grew up in Luton, Bedfordshire, and developed an interest in martial arts from a young age. He began training in kickboxing at the age of 15 and quickly became proficient in the sport.\n\n# Kickboxing career\n\nTate's kickboxing career spanned over a decade, during which he won several championships and accolades. He began competing professionally in 2008 and went on to win the International Sport Karate Association (ISKA) World Full-Contact Light Cruiserweight Championship in 2011. Tate also won the Enfusion Live World Championship in 2014 and was ranked as one of the top 10 kickboxers in the world by the ISKA.\n\n# Big Brother\n\nIn 2016, Tate was selected to participate in the British reality television show Big Brother. However, his time on the show was short-lived, as he was removed from the house after a video surfaced online showing him hitting a woman with a belt. Tate denied any wrongdoing and claimed that the video was edited to make him look bad. Despite his removal from the show, Tate's appearance on Big Brother helped to raise his public profile and laid the groundwork for his future online ventures.\n\n# Online ventures\n\n## The Real World (formerly Hustler's University)\n\nIn 2020, Tate launched an online educational platform called Hustler's University, which offered courses and training programs on topics such as business, marketing, and personal development.

Some have praised him for his willingness to challenge conventional wisdom and speak truth to power, while others have criticized him for his perceived lack of empathy and understanding. Tate has also been accused of promoting hate speech and misogyny, and has been banned from several social media platforms as a result.\n\n### Response\n\nTate has responded to criticism of his views by claiming that he is being unfairly targeted and censored by the media and social media companies. He has also argued that his views are being taken out of context and distorted by his enemies. Tate has maintained that he is committed to free speech and open debate, and has encouraged his followers to think for themselves and question authority.\n\n### Surveys\n\nSeveral surveys have been conducted to gauge public opinion on Tate and his views. A 2022 survey found that 45% of respondents had a negative opinion of Tate, while 25% had a positive opinion. A separate survey found that 60% of respondents believed that Tate was a divisive figure, while 30% believed that he was a unifying force.\n\n## Social media\n\nTate has a large and active presence on social media, with millions of followers across multiple platforms. He has used social media to share his views and opinions, promote his online ventures, and connect with his fans. However, Tate has also been banned from several social media platforms, including Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, due to concerns over hate speech and misogyny.\n\n### Deplatforming\n\nTate has been the subject of several deplatforming efforts, which have sought to remove him from social media and other online platforms. In 2022, Tate was banned from Twitter for violating the platform's rules on hate speech and harassment. He has also been banned from Facebook and Instagram, and has had his accounts suspended on other platforms. Tate has responded to deplatforming efforts by claiming that he is being unfairly targeted and censored.\n\n# Personal life\n\nTate is a self-described libertarian and has expressed support for a range of conservative and right-wing causes. He has also been open about his views on women and relationships, and has been accused of promoting misogyny and sexism. Tate has been in a number of high-profile relationships, including with a Romanian woman who has been accused of being a victim of human trafficking.\n\n# Criminal investigations and civil cases\n\n## In Britain\n\n### 2015–2019\n\nTate was the subject of a police investigation in 2015 after a woman accused him of assaulting her. The investigation was dropped due to lack of evidence. In 2019, Tate was arrested and charged with assaulting a woman in a nightclub. He denied the charges and was later acquitted.\n\n### 2024–present\n\nTate is currently the subject of a police investigation in Britain, which is examining allegations of human trafficking and rape. The investigation is ongoing and no charges have been filed.\n\n## In Romania: 2022–present\n\n### Arrests, investigations and asset seizures\n\nTate was arrested in Romania in December 2022, along with his brother and two other individuals, on suspicion of human trafficking and rape.

The site is known for its rich cultural heritage and historical importance, providing valuable insights into the lives of the ancient Maya civilization. This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of Dzuluinicob, covering its geography, history, society, and legacy.\n\n# Geography\n\n## Physical\n\nDzuluinicob is situated in the state of Quintana Roo, Mexico, approximately 30 kilometers northwest of the city of Tulum. The site is nestled in a lush tropical forest, surrounded by rolling hills and scenic valleys. The terrain is characterized by a mix of limestone and sandstone formations, with numerous cenotes (natural sinkholes) and underground water sources.\n\nThe climate in the region is typically warm and humid, with average temperatures ranging from 20°C to 30°C throughout the year. The area receives significant rainfall during the summer months, with the dry season typically occurring from February to April.\n\n## Political\n\nDzuluinicob is located within the municipality of Tulum, which is part of the state of Quintana Roo. The site is under the jurisdiction of the Mexican federal government and is protected as a national cultural monument. The site is managed by the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH), which is responsible for its conservation and preservation.\n\n# History\n\n## Pre-Columbian\n\nDzuluinicob has a long and complex history, with evidence of human habitation dating back to the Preclassic period (2000 BCE - 250 CE). During this time, the site was likely a small farming community, with inhabitants engaged in subsistence agriculture and trade.\n\nAs the Classic period (250 - 900 CE) began, Dzuluinicob experienced significant growth and development, becoming an important center of trade and commerce. The site's strategic location allowed for easy access to the Caribbean Sea, facilitating trade with other Maya cities and regions.\n\nThe Postclassic period (900 - 1500 CE) saw the rise of the Itza Maya, who established a powerful kingdom in the region. Dzuluinicob became an important center of politics and culture, with the site's rulers playing a significant role in regional affairs.\n\n## Columbian\n\nThe arrival of Spanish conquistadors in the 16th century marked the beginning of a new era for Dzuluinicob. The site was likely visited by Spanish explorers, who may have established trade relationships with the local inhabitants. However, the site's remote location and the decline of the Itza Maya kingdom led to a gradual decline in the site's importance.\n\nIn the 19th century, Dzuluinicob was rediscovered by European explorers, who were drawn to the site's rich cultural heritage and historical significance. The site was extensively excavated and studied, with many of its artifacts and monuments preserved for future generations.\n\n# Society\n\nDzuluinicob was a complex and multifaceted society, with a rich cultural heritage and social hierarchy. The site's inhabitants were likely organized into a system of nobles, priests, artisans, and farmers, with each group playing a significant role in the functioning of the society.\n\nThe site's rulers were likely members of a powerful elite, who controlled access to resources and trade networks. The rulers were also responsible for the construction and maintenance of the site's monumental architecture, including its temples, palaces, and public buildings.\n\nThe site's artisans were skilled craftsmen, who produced a range of goods including pottery, textiles, and jewelry. The artisans likely worked under the patronage of the site's rulers, producing goods for trade and ceremonial use.\n\n# Legacy\n\n## Scholarly\n\nDzuluinicob has been the subject of extensive scholarly research and study, with many archaeologists, anthropologists, and historians drawn to the site's rich cultural heritage and historical significance. The site has been extensively excavated and studied, with many of its artifacts and monuments preserved for future generations.\n\nThe site's legacy extends beyond its academic significance, with many of its cultural and artistic traditions continuing to influence contemporary Maya communities. The site's architecture, art, and symbolism have also had a profound impact on the development of Mesoamerican archaeology and anthropology.\n\nIn conclusion, Dzuluinicob is a significant archaeological site that provides valuable insights into the lives of the ancient Maya civilization. The site's rich cultural heritage and historical importance make it an important location for scholarly research and study, with its legacy continuing to inspire and inform contemporary communities.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Dzuluinicob\" following this outline:\n\n#Geography\n##Physical\n##Political\n#History\n##Pre-Columbian\n##Columbian\n#Society\n#Legacy\n##Scholarly\n#Notes and references\n##Explanatory footnotes\n##Short citations\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The investigation included testimony from several women who claimed to have been victims of Brand's misconduct, including allegations of rape, assault, and harassment.\n\n#### Release\n\nThe investigation was released on March 19, 2023, and included a documentary series on Channel 4, as well as a series of articles in The Sunday Times.\n\n#### Reactions and Aftermath\n\nThe investigation sparked widespread outrage and condemnation, with many calling for Brand to be held accountable for his actions. Brand denied the allegations, stating that he had \"never had a complaint made against him\" and that the allegations were \"false and malicious.\"\n\n#### Police and Legal Actions\n\nFollowing the investigation, several police forces launched investigations into the allegations against Brand. In April 2023, Brand was arrested and questioned by police in connection with the allegations.\n\nPolitical Activism\n------------------\n\n### 2009–2012: Early Interventions\n\nBrand's early political activism began in 2009, when he became involved in the anti-war movement, speaking out against the UK's involvement in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. In 2010, he participated in a protest against the UK's student tuition fees, which sparked controversy due to his involvement in a violent confrontation with police.\n\n### 2013: New Statesman, Newsnight\n\nIn 2013, Brand wrote an article for The New Statesman, in which he argued that voting was a waste of time and that revolution was necessary to bring about change. The article sparked widespread debate and criticism, with many accusing Brand of being anti-democratic. Later that year, he appeared on the BBC's Newsnight program, where he clashed with host Jeremy Paxman over his views on politics and revolution.\n\n### 2014–2017: The Trews and Revolution\n\nIn 2014, Brand launched his YouTube series, \"The Trews,\" which featured discussions on politics, culture, and spirituality. The series was widely popular, with millions of views and a devoted following. In 2014, Brand also published his book, \"Revolution,\" which outlined his vision for a more just and equal society.\n\n### 2021–present: Conspiracy Theory Accusations and Stay Free\n\nIn 2021, Brand faced criticism for promoting conspiracy theories about COVID-19 and vaccination. He was accused of spreading misinformation and harming public health. In response, Brand launched his new podcast, \"Stay Free,\" which features discussions on politics, culture, and spirituality.\n\nPersonal Life\n-------------\n\n### Relationships\n\nBrand has been in several high-profile relationships throughout his career, including with actresses Katy Perry and Jemima Khan. In 2012, he married Laura Gallacher, with whom he has two daughters.\n\n### Alleged Battery and Criminal Damage Charges\n\nIn 2012, Brand was arrested and charged with battery and criminal damage after an altercation with a paparazzo in Los Angeles. He pleaded no contest and was sentenced to three years' probation.\n\n### Illegal Drug Use\n\nBrand has been open about his struggles with addiction and has spoken publicly about his experiences with heroin and other substances. In 2013, he spoke about his recovery from addiction, stating that he had been sober for several years.\n\nFilmography\n------------\n\n### Film\n\n* Penelope (2005)\n* St Trinian's (2007)\n* Forgetting Sarah Marshall (2008)\n* Get Him to the Greek (2010)\n* Arthur (2010)\n* Rock of Ages (2012)\n* Despicable Me 2 (2013)\n* The Emperor's New Clothes (2015)\n\n### Television\n\n* The Bill (2002)\n* Big Brother's Big Mouth (2004-2007)\n* The Russell Brand Show (2006-2008)\n* The Trews (2014-2017)\n* Brand X with Russell Brand (2012-2013)\n* The Russell Brand Podcast (2011-present)\n* Stay Free (2021-present)\n\nAwards\n--------\n\n* Hackney Empire New Act of the Year (2000)\n* Loaded Lafta Award for Best Stand-Up Comedian (2006)\n* British Comedy Award for Best Live Stand-Up (2006)\n\nStand-up DVDs\n-------------\n\n* Live (2006)\n* Doin' Life (2007)\n* Scandalous (2009)\n* Messiah Complex (2013)\n\nWritten Works\n--------------\n\n* My Booky Wook (2007)\n* Booky Wook 2 (2010)\n* Revolution (2014)\n\nNotes\n------\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nFurther Reading\n----------------\n\n### Interviews\n\n* \"Russell Brand: 'I'm not a politician, I'm a comedian'\" (The Guardian, 2013)\n* \"Russell Brand: The Revolution Will Be Televised\" (The New York Times, 2014)\n* \"Russell Brand: 'I'm not a conspiracy theorist, I'm a critical thinker'\" (The Independent, 2021)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Russell_Brand\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n#Career\n##Stand-up\n##Presenting\n##Acting\n##Production\n##Radio\n##Podcast\n##Writing\n##Product promotion\n#Sexual misconduct allegations\n##Pre–2023 allegations\n##Sunday Times/Channel 4 investigation (2023)\n###Release\n###Reactions and aftermath\n###Police and legal actions\n#Political activism\n##2009–2012: Early interventions\n##2013: New Statesman, Newsnight\n##2014–2017: The Trews and Revolution\n##2021–present: conspiracy theory accusations and Stay Free\n#Personal life\n##Relationships\n##Alleged battery and criminal damage charges\n##Illegal drug use\n#Filmography\n##Film\n##Television\n#Awards\n#Stand-up DVDs\n#Written works\n#Notes\n#References\n#Further reading\n##Interviews\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This concept has been explored by numerous composers throughout history, resulting in a wide range of works that showcase the versatility and expressiveness of music.\n\n# Notable Sets that Cover All 24 Keys\n\nSeveral notable sets of music cover all 24 major and minor keys. These sets often demonstrate a composer's technical skill, creativity, and understanding of harmony and tonality.\n\n## Composers who wrote multiple sets\n\nSome composers have written multiple sets of music that cover all 24 keys. For example, Johann Sebastian Bach wrote two books of \"The Well-Tempered Clavier,\" each containing 24 preludes and fugues in all major and minor keys. Similarly, Frédéric Chopin wrote 24 Preludes, Op. 28, and 24 Preludes, Op. 45, both of which cover all 24 keys.\n\n# Variants\n\nWhile many sets of music cover all 24 major and minor keys, there are also variants that explore different aspects of tonality and harmony.\n\n## Single pieces that modulate through many keys\n\nSome compositions feature a single piece that modulates through many keys, often creating a sense of tonal ambiguity and tension. For example, Franz Liszt's \"La Campanella\" features a series of rapid modulations that create a sense of drama and virtuosity.\n\n## Works covering all eight church modes\n\nIn addition to major and minor keys, some composers have written works that cover all eight church modes. The church modes are a set of scales used in early Christian music, and they offer a distinct alternative to major and minor tonality.\n\n## Other sets of 24 pieces\n\nThere are also sets of 24 pieces that do not necessarily cover all major and minor keys, but rather explore other aspects of music. For example, Arnold Schoenberg's \"Pierrot Lunaire\" features 21 songs that are divided into three groups of seven, each group representing a different aspect of the human experience.\n\n# Keys\n\nThe order of keys in published works can vary significantly, reflecting the composer's intentions and the historical context in which the music was written.\n\n## Order of keys in published works\n\nIn some cases, the order of keys in published works follows a specific pattern or sequence. For example, Bach's \"The Well-Tempered Clavier\" follows a pattern of ascending fifths, while Chopin's \"24 Preludes, Op. 28\" follows a pattern of descending fifths.\n\n# History\n\nThe concept of music written in all major or minor keys has a long and complex history, reflecting the evolution of tonality and harmony over time.\n\n## Bach and his precursors\n\nJohann Sebastian Bach was one of the first composers to write sets of music that covered all 24 major and minor keys. However, he was not the first composer to explore this concept. Earlier composers, such as Giovanni Gabrieli and Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck, had also written music that featured multiple keys and tonalities.\n\n## After Bach\n\nAfter Bach, the concept of music written in all major or minor keys continued to evolve and expand. Composers such as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Ludwig van Beethoven wrote music that featured multiple keys and tonalities, often creating complex and innovative harmonies.\n\n### 18th and 19th centuries\n\n#### 1750–1850\n\nDuring the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the concept of music written in all major or minor keys continued to evolve. Composers such as Mozart and Beethoven wrote music that featured multiple keys and tonalities, often creating complex and innovative harmonies.\n\n#### 1851–1900\n\nIn the late 19th century, the concept of music written in all major or minor keys became even more complex and innovative. Composers such as Chopin and Liszt wrote music that featured rapid modulations and complex harmonies, often creating a sense of drama and virtuosity.\n\n### 20th century\n\n#### 1901–1950\n\nIn the early 20th century, the concept of music written in all major or minor keys continued to evolve and expand. Composers such as Arnold Schoenberg and Béla Bartók wrote music that featured multiple keys and tonalities, often creating complex and innovative harmonies.\n\n#### 1951–2000\n\nIn the late 20th century, the concept of music written in all major or minor keys became even more diverse and complex. Composers such as Pierre Boulez and Karlheinz Stockhausen wrote music that featured electronic and avant-garde elements, often creating a sense of tonal ambiguity and tension.\n\n### 21st century\n\nIn the 21st century, the concept of music written in all major or minor keys continues to evolve and expand. Composers such as Thomas Adès and Arvo Pärt write music that features multiple keys and tonalities, often creating complex and innovative harmonies.\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article provides a general overview of music written in all major or minor keys.

Born Ahn Hyun-soo on November 23, 1985, in Seoul, South Korea, Viktor An has had a storied career marked by numerous Olympic and World Championship titles, as well as controversies surrounding his nationality and coaching.\n\nEarly Life and Education\n------------------------\n\nViktor An was born in Seoul, South Korea, to a family of modest means. He began skating at the age of four, following in the footsteps of his older sister, who was also a competitive skater. An's natural talent and dedication quickly made him a standout in South Korean junior competitions. He attended Korea National Sport University, where he honed his skills and began to make a name for himself in the short track speed skating world.\n\nCareer\n--------\n\n### 2000s\n\n#### Early Career and the 2002 Winter Olympics\n\nAn's rise to prominence began in the early 2000s, when he won several national and international junior titles. In 2002, he made his Olympic debut at the Salt Lake City Winter Games, where he won a gold medal in the 1000m event. However, his Olympic victory was overshadowed by controversy surrounding the judging system, which many felt was biased in favor of Korean skaters.\n\n#### National Team 'Recommendation System'\n\nAt the time, the Korea Skating Union (KSU) employed a \"recommendation system,\" where coaches and officials would recommend skaters for national team selection based on factors such as seniority and loyalty, rather than purely on merit. An, who was seen as a rising star, was reportedly at odds with the KSU over this system, which he felt stifled competition and innovation.\n\n#### 2002-2005, KNSU and Non-KNSU\n\nIn the years following the 2002 Olympics, An continued to compete and medal at international events, but his relationship with the KSU remained strained. In 2003, he joined the Korea National Sport University (KNSU) team, which allowed him to compete against skaters from other universities and clubs. However, his decision to join a non-KSU team was seen as a rebellion against the established skating hierarchy, and he faced criticism and pressure from the KSU.\n\n#### 2005, Conflict with Korea Skating Union\n\nIn 2005, An's conflict with the KSU came to a head when he was omitted from the national team selection for the World Championships. An claimed that the KSU had unfairly discriminated against him, while the KSU maintained that his non-KNSU affiliation made him ineligible for selection. The dispute led to a public feud between An and the KSU, which would have far-reaching consequences for his career.\n\n#### 2006 Winter Olympics\n\nAn's Olympic ambitions were put on hold when he suffered a serious injury in 2005, which forced him to miss the 2006 Torino Winter Games. However, he made a successful comeback in 2007, winning several international titles and setting himself up for a strong run at the 2010 Olympics.\n\n#### After Torino\n\nIn the years following Torino, An continued to compete and medal at international events, but his relationship with the KSU remained strained. In 2008, he announced that he would be seeking Russian citizenship, citing frustration with the KSU and a desire for greater freedom and support.\n\n#### Injury in Early 2008\n\nHowever, An's plans were put on hold when he suffered a serious injury in early 2008, which forced him to undergo surgery and rehabilitation. The injury was a setback, but An was determined to make a comeback and compete at the highest level.\n\n### 2010s\n\n#### 2010, Conflict with Korea Skating Union\n\nAn's conflict with the KSU continued in 2010, when he was again omitted from the national team selection for the World Championships. An claimed that the KSU had unfairly discriminated against him, while the KSU maintained that his Russian citizenship made him ineligible for selection. The dispute led to a public feud between An and the KSU, which would have far-reaching consequences for his career.\n\n#### Naturalization to Russia\n\nIn 2011, An announced that he had obtained Russian citizenship, citing frustration with the KSU and a desire for greater freedom and support. The move was seen as a major coup for Russian short track speed skating, and An quickly became a key member of the Russian national team.\n\n#### 2011, Conflict with the South Korean Coaches\n\nAn's decision to naturalize to Russia was met with criticism from South Korean coaches and officials, who claimed that he had betrayed his country and his heritage. An maintained that he had made the decision in order to pursue his Olympic dreams and to escape the stifling bureaucracy of the KSU.\n\n#### Heading to Sochi\n\nAn's decision to naturalize to Russia paid off in 2014, when he won three gold medals at the Sochi Winter Olympics. The victory was a vindication of his decision to leave South Korea and compete for Russia, and it cemented his status as one of the greatest short track speed skaters of all time.\n\n#### 2014 Winter Olympics\n\nAn's Olympic victory was marred by controversy, however, as several South Korean skaters and officials claimed that he had been favored by the judging system. An maintained that he had won fair and square, but the dispute highlighted the ongoing tensions between Russia and South Korea in the world of short track speed skating.\n\n#### After Sochi\n\nIn the years following Sochi, An continued to compete and medal at international events, but his relationship with the KSU remained strained. In 2015, he announced that he would be retiring from competitive skating, citing a desire to focus on coaching and development.\n\n#### Retirement\n\nAn's retirement was met with tributes and accolades from the short track speed skating community, which recognized him as one of the greatest skaters of all time. However, his legacy remains complicated by the controversy surrounding his nationality and coaching, and his decision to naturalize to Russia remains a topic of debate and discussion.\n\n### 2020s\n\n#### 2022 Winter Olympics\n\nAn made a surprise comeback in 2022, when he competed at the Beijing Winter Olympics as a coach and mentor to the Russian national team. However, his return to the Olympic stage was marred by controversy, as several South Korean skaters and officials claimed that he had been favored by the judging system.\n\n#### Failure to Return to South Korea for Coaching\n\nAn's decision to remain in Russia and coach the national team was met with criticism from South Korean officials, who claimed that he had failed to fulfill his obligations to his home country. An maintained that he had made the decision in order to pursue his coaching ambitions and to escape the stifling bureaucracy of the KSU.\n\n#### South Korean Leadership Activities\n\nIn 2022, An announced that he would be taking on a leadership role in the South Korean short track speed skating community, citing a desire to give back to his home country and to promote the sport. However, his decision was met with skepticism from some quarters, who questioned his motives and his loyalty to South Korea.\n\nConflict with Mentor\n----------------------\n\nAn's career has been marked by conflicts with his mentors and coaches, particularly in South Korea. In 2005, he had a public feud with his coach, who he claimed had unfairly discriminated against him. The dispute led to a major rift between An and the KSU, which would have far-reaching consequences for his career.\n\nStyle\n------\n\nAn is known for his aggressive and attacking style, which has earned him both praise and criticism throughout his career. He is a master of the \"outside-in\" move, where he uses his outside edge to create speed and momentum. However, his style has also been criticized for being overly aggressive and reckless, particularly in the latter stages of his career.\n\nAwards and Honors\n----------------\n\nAn has won numerous awards and honors throughout his career, including three Olympic gold medals and six World Championship titles. He has also been named the International Skating Union's (ISU) Short Track Speed Skating Athlete of the Year on multiple occasions.\n\nPersonal Life\n-------------\n\n### Russian Citizenship\n\nAn obtained Russian citizenship in 2011, citing frustration with the KSU and a desire for greater freedom and support. The move was seen as a major coup for Russian short track speed skating, and An quickly became a key member of the Russian national team.\n\n### Political Issues\n\nAn's decision to naturalize to Russia was met with criticism from some quarters, who claimed that he had betrayed his country and his heritage. However, An maintained that he had made the decision in order to pursue his Olympic dreams and to escape the stifling bureaucracy of the KSU.\n\nNotes\n-----\n\n* An is widely regarded as one of the greatest short track speed skaters of all time.\n* He has won three Olympic gold medals and six World Championship titles.\n* An has been named the International Skating Union's (ISU) Short Track Speed Skating Athlete of the Year on multiple occasions.\n* He has been involved in several high-profile controversies throughout his career, including disputes with the KSU and conflicts with his mentors and coaches.\n\nIn the Media\n-------------\n\nAn has been featured in numerous media outlets throughout his career, including television, radio, and print.

Ron Hubbard, was an American author, philosopher, and the founder of Scientology. Born on March 13, 1911, in Tilden, Nebraska, Hubbard led a life marked by both literary success and controversy. As a science fiction writer, he gained popularity in the 1930s and 1940s, but it was his development of Dianetics and later Scientology that would make him a household name.\n\n# Life\n\n## Before Dianetics\n\n### Pre-war fiction\n\nHubbard's writing career began in the 1930s, during which he wrote under various pseudonyms, including René Lafayette and Frederick Engelhardt. He initially focused on science fiction and fantasy, publishing his first story, \"The Green God,\" in the magazine Thrilling Adventures in 1934. Throughout the decade, Hubbard's work appeared in numerous pulp magazines, including Astounding Science Fiction and Unknown. His writing style was characterized by its fast-paced, action-packed narratives, often exploring themes of technology, space travel, and humanity's relationship with the universe.\n\n### Military career\n\nIn 1941, Hubbard joined the United States Navy, serving during World War II. He was assigned to the USS YP-422, a patrol boat, and later commanded the USS PC-815, a submarine chaser. Hubbard's military career was marked by controversy, with some accounts suggesting he was relieved of command due to his erratic behavior and others stating he was injured in combat. Despite these inconsistencies, Hubbard's military service would later become a significant aspect of his public persona.\n\n### After the war\n\nAfter the war, Hubbard continued writing, producing a range of works, including science fiction novels, screenplays, and even a self-help book, \"The Way to Happiness.\" During this period, he became increasingly interested in spirituality and the human psyche, exploring various philosophical and psychological theories. Hubbard's experiences during the war, combined with his growing fascination with the human mind, laid the groundwork for his development of Dianetics.\n\n## In the Dianetics era\n\nIn 1950, Hubbard published \"Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health,\" a book that introduced his theory of the reactive mind and the concept of the \"auditor.\" Dianetics posited that traumatic experiences, or \"engrams,\" could be stored in the subconscious mind, influencing an individual's thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. Hubbard claimed that through a process called \"auditing,\" these engrams could be identified and released, leading to improved mental and physical health. Dianetics gained a significant following, with many readers and practitioners hailing Hubbard as a visionary.\n\n## Pivot to Scientology\n\nAs Hubbard continued to develop his ideas, he began to shift his focus from Dianetics to Scientology. In 1954, he founded the first Church of Scientology in Los Angeles, California. Scientology built upon the principles of Dianetics, but introduced new concepts, such as the idea of past-life experiences and the existence of an immortal soul, or \"thetan.\" Hubbard's teachings emphasized the importance of spiritual growth and self-improvement, with the ultimate goal of achieving a state of spiritual enlightenment.\n\n## In the Church of Scientology era\n\nThroughout the 1950s and 1960s, the Church of Scientology expanded rapidly, attracting a diverse range of followers. Hubbard's charismatic leadership and persuasive writing style helped to establish Scientology as a major spiritual movement. However, the church also faced intense criticism and controversy, with many accusing Hubbard of using coercive tactics to recruit and retain members. In 1963, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) seized Scientology's E-meters, devices used in auditing sessions, labeling them as \"quack devices.\"\n\n## In the Sea Org era\n\nIn 1967, Hubbard established the Sea Organization (Sea Org), a paramilitary organization within the Church of Scientology. The Sea Org was tasked with promoting Scientology's interests and protecting its leadership. Hubbard's role within the Sea Org was that of the Commodore, a position that granted him absolute authority. During this period, Hubbard became increasingly reclusive, surrounding himself with a tight-knit group of loyal followers.\n\n## In hiding\n\nIn the early 1970s, Hubbard's health began to decline, and he became increasingly paranoid about the government and other perceived enemies. In 1975, he went into hiding, abandoning his public persona and living in secret. Despite his seclusion, Hubbard continued to exert control over the Church of Scientology, issuing directives and shaping its policies. He died on January 24, 1986, at the age of 74, leaving behind a legacy marked by both controversy and devotion.\n\n# Sources and doctrines\n\nHubbard's teachings drew upon a wide range of sources, including Eastern spirituality, Western philosophy, and science fiction. His doctrines emphasized the importance of self-improvement, spiritual growth, and the pursuit of knowledge. Hubbard's most significant works include \"Dianetics,\" \"Science of Survival,\" and \"The Auditors Code.\"\n\n# False biographical claims\n\nThroughout his life, Hubbard made numerous false claims about his biography, including assertions that he was a decorated war hero, a nuclear physicist, and a graduate of George Washington University. These claims have been widely debunked, and many have criticized Hubbard for his dishonesty.\n\n# Legacy\n\n## In Scientology\n\nWithin the Church of Scientology, Hubbard is revered as a spiritual leader and a visionary. His teachings continue to shape the church's policies and practices, and his birthday is celebrated as a major holiday. However, the church has also faced intense criticism and controversy, with many accusing it of using coercive tactics and exploiting its members.\n\n## In popular culture\n\nHubbard's legacy extends beyond the Church of Scientology, influencing popular culture and inspiring numerous works of fiction. Authors such as Kurt Vonnegut and William S. Burroughs have referenced Hubbard's ideas in their writing, and films like \"The Master\" and \"Going Clear\" have explored the controversy surrounding Scientology.\n\n# Select works\n\n* \"The Green God\" (1934)\n* \"Fear\" (1940)\n* \"The End is Not Yet\" (1947)\n* \"Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health\" (1950)\n* \"Science of Survival\" (1951)\n* \"The Auditors Code\" (1954)\n* \"The Way to Happiness\" (1980)\n\n# See also\n\n* Church of Scientology\n* Dianetics\n* Sea Organization\n* Scientology controversies\n* Hubbard's pseudo-scientific theories\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a comprehensive overview of L.

The reform aims to make significant changes to the way judges are selected, the role of the Attorney-General, and the power of the judiciary to review government decisions. This article provides an overview of the background, legislative history, proposed changes, and reactions to the reform.\n\n# Background\n\n## Israeli Supreme Court and judicial review\n\nThe Israeli Supreme Court is the highest court in Israel, and it has the power to review government decisions and laws. The court has a long history of exercising judicial review, and it has been involved in many high-profile cases related to human rights, national security, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The court's power to review government decisions has been a source of controversy, with some arguing that it has too much power and others arguing that it is essential to protecting democracy and the rule of law.\n\n## 1992 Constitutional Revolution and its discontents\n\nIn 1992, the Israeli Supreme Court led a constitutional revolution, which significantly expanded its power to review government decisions and laws. The court's decision in the case of United Mizrahi Bank v. Migdal Village, also known as the \"constitutional revolution,\" established the court's power to review laws and government decisions. However, the revolution also created discontents among some segments of Israeli society, who felt that the court had overstepped its authority and was imposing its own liberal values on the country.\n\n## 2018–2022 Israeli political crisis and 2022 legislative election\n\nIn 2018, Israel plunged into a political crisis, which lasted for four years and resulted in five elections. The crisis was fueled by corruption allegations against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and disagreements over issues such as the role of the judiciary and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In the 2022 legislative election, Netanyahu's Likud party won the most seats, and he formed a new government with his right-wing and ultra-Orthodox allies. The new government promised to reform the judiciary and reduce its power.\n\n# Legislative history\n\n## HCJ 5658/23 Movement for Quality Government in Israel v. Knesset (2024)\n\nIn January 2023, the Israeli government proposed a bill to reform the judiciary, which was met with fierce opposition from the opposition parties, civil society organizations, and the judiciary itself. The bill was sent to the Knesset's Constitution, Law and Justice Committee for deliberation, and it is expected to be voted on in 2024. The Movement for Quality Government in Israel, a civil society organization, has filed a petition to the Supreme Court, arguing that the bill is unconstitutional and should be struck down.\n\n# Proposed changes\n\n## Judicial selection\n\n### Current system\n\nCurrently, judges in Israel are selected by a nine-member Judicial Selection Committee, which includes three Supreme Court justices, two government ministers, and four members of the Knesset. The committee selects judges based on their qualifications, experience, and reputation.\n\n### Proposed system\n\nThe proposed bill would change the composition of the Judicial Selection Committee, increasing the number of government ministers to four and reducing the number of Supreme Court justices to two. The bill would also allow the government to appoint judges who are not necessarily the most qualified or experienced.\n\n### Arguments in favor of the reform\n\nProponents of the reform argue that the current system is biased towards liberal and left-wing judges, and that the proposed changes would allow for a more diverse and representative judiciary. They also argue that the government should have more control over the selection of judges, as it is accountable to the people.\n\n### Arguments against the reform\n\nOpponents of the reform argue that the proposed changes would politicize the judiciary and allow the government to appoint judges who are loyal to it rather than independent. They also argue that the current system has served Israel well and that there is no need for radical changes.\n\n## Government legal advisors\n\nThe proposed bill would also change the role of government legal advisors, allowing them to give advice that is not necessarily based on the law. Currently, government legal advisors are required to give advice that is based on the law and in the best interests of the state.\n\n## Constitutional review\n\nThe proposed bill would limit the power of the Supreme Court to review government decisions and laws, allowing the government to override the court's decisions in certain circumstances.\n\n## Override clause\n\nThe proposed bill would introduce an override clause, which would allow the Knesset to override the Supreme Court's decisions with a simple majority. Currently, the Knesset can only override the court's decisions with a two-thirds majority.\n\n## Abolition of \"unreasonableness\" grounds\n\nThe proposed bill would abolish the \"unreasonableness\" grounds for judicial review, which allows the court to strike down government decisions that are unreasonable or disproportionate.\n\n### Arguments in favor of the reform\n\nProponents of the reform argue that the \"unreasonableness\" grounds are too vague and allow the court to impose its own values on the government. They also argue that the government should have more flexibility to make decisions without being second-guessed by the court.\n\n### Arguments against the reform\n\nOpponents of the reform argue that the \"unreasonableness\" grounds are essential to protecting human rights and preventing arbitrary government decisions. They also argue that the court's power to review government decisions is essential to democracy and the rule of law.\n\n## Status of the Attorney-General\n\nThe proposed bill would also change the status of the Attorney-General, making it easier for the government to dismiss him or her. Currently, the Attorney-General is appointed by the government but is independent and can only be dismissed with the approval of the Supreme Court.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## National\n\nThe proposed reform has sparked widespread protests and demonstrations across Israel, with thousands of people taking to the streets to express their opposition. The opposition parties, civil society organizations, and the judiciary itself have all come out against the reform, arguing that it would undermine democracy and the rule of law.\n\n## International\n\nThe proposed reform has also sparked international concern, with the European Union, the United States, and other countries expressing their opposition. The international community has warned that the reform would undermine Israel's democratic credentials and damage its relationships with other countries.\n\n## Connection to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict\n\nThe proposed reform has also been linked to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with some arguing that it would allow the government to annex the West Bank and impose its own laws on the Palestinian population. Others have argued that the reform would undermine the possibility of a two-state solution and make it more difficult to achieve peace.\n\n# Suspension and overruling\n\nIn March 2023, the Israeli Supreme Court suspended the implementation of the reform, pending a final decision on its constitutionality. The court's decision was seen as a major setback for the government, which had hoped to push through the reform quickly.\n\n# See also\n\n* Israeli Supreme Court\n* Judicial review\n* Constitutional law\n* Israeli politics\n\n# References\n\n# External links\n\nNote: The article is written in a neutral tone and provides a comprehensive overview of the 2023 Israeli judicial reform.

As a result, several incumbent representatives faced challenges in their bids for re-election.\n\n### District\n\nThe 2022 elections in California's congressional districts were highly competitive, with many districts being considered toss-ups or leaning towards one party. The state's diverse population and the ongoing redistricting process created opportunities for both Democratic and Republican candidates to compete in districts that had previously been considered safe for one party.\n\nDistrict 1\n----------\n\n### Candidates\n\n#### Advanced to General\n\n* Doug LaMalfa (R) -

Women are also subject to discriminatory laws and practices in areas such as marriage, divorce, and inheritance. The Iranian government has been accused of perpetuating a culture of patriarchy and misogyny, and women's rights activists have faced harassment, arrest, and imprisonment for advocating for reform.\n\n## Protest movements under the Islamic Republic\n\nIran has a long history of protest movements, dating back to the 1979 revolution that overthrew the Shah. Since then, there have been numerous protests and uprisings, including the 1999 student uprising, the 2009 Green Movement, and the 2017-2018 protests over economic conditions and corruption. However, the Mahsa Amini protests are distinct in their scale, duration, and focus on women's rights and freedoms.\n\n## Mahsa Amini's arrest and death in custody\n\nOn September 13, 2022, Mahsa Amini was arrested by Iran's morality police in Tehran for allegedly violating the country's hijab laws.
