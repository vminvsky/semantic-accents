The championship was contested between Ian Nepomniachtchi and Ding Liren, with the latter ultimately emerging as the new champion.\n\nCarlsen refuses to defend the title\n\nMagnus Carlsen, the reigning World Chess Champion since 2013, announced in July 2022 that he would not defend his title in the 2023 championship match. This decision marked the first time a World Chess Champion had declined to defend their title since Garry Kasparov in 2000.\n\n## History of non-participation\n\nCarlsen's decision not to defend his title was not without precedent. In 1975, Bobby Fischer refused to defend his title against Anatoly Karpov, citing disagreements with the World Chess Federation (FIDE) over the match format and prize fund. Similarly, in 2000, Garry Kasparov declined to defend his title against Vladimir Kramnik, citing a desire to focus on other aspects of his chess career.\n\nCandidates Tournament 2022\n\nAs a result of Carlsen's decision not to defend his title, the 2023 World Chess Championship match was contested between the top two finishers in the 2022 Candidates Tournament. The tournament was held in Madrid, Spain, from June 16 to July 5, 2022, and featured eight of the world's top chess players.\n\n## Results\n\nThe 2022 Candidates Tournament was won by Ian Nepomniachtchi, who scored 9.5/14 to finish ahead of Ding Liren on tiebreak.

Nepomniachtchi's seconds included Vladimir Potkin, Sergey Karjakin, and Evgeny Tomashevsky, while Ding's seconds included Yu Yangyi, Wang Yue, and Wei Yi.\n\n## Schedule\n\nThe championship match was played over 14 days, with one game per day. The match began on April 9, 2023, and concluded on April 30, 2023.\n\n## Leak of Ding Liren's preparation\n\nIn the days leading up to the match, there were reports that Ding Liren's preparation had been leaked to Ian Nepomniachtchi's team. However, these reports were never confirmed, and it is unclear whether or not the leak had any impact on the outcome of the match.\n\nResults\n\nThe 2023 World Chess Championship match was played over 14 classical games, with Ding Liren ultimately emerging as the winner.\n\n## Classical games\n\n### Game 1: Nepomniachtchi–Ding, ½–½\n\nThe first game of the match was a quiet draw, with both players agreeing to a peaceful result after just 30 moves.\n\n### Game 2: Ding–Nepomniachtchi, 0–1\n\nIn the second game, Nepomniachtchi scored a convincing win with the white pieces, using a powerful attack to overwhelm Ding's position.\n\n### Game 3: Nepomniachtchi–Ding, ½–½\n\nThe third game was another draw, with both players playing cautiously and avoiding any major risks.\n\n### Game 4: Ding–Nepomniachtchi, 1–0\n\nIn the fourth game, Ding scored a crucial win with the black pieces, using a clever combination to catch Nepomniachtchi off guard.\n\n### Game 5: Nepomniachtchi–Ding, 1–0\n\nNepomniachtchi bounced back in the fifth game, scoring a solid win with the white pieces to level the score.\n\n### Game 6: Ding–Nepomniachtchi, 1–0\n\nDing took the lead again in the sixth game, using a powerful attack to overwhelm Nepomniachtchi's position.\n\n### Game 7: Nepomniachtchi–Ding, 1–0\n\nNepomniachtchi scored another win in the seventh game, using a clever combination to catch Ding off guard.\n\n### Game 8: Ding–Nepomniachtchi, ½–½\n\nThe eighth game was another draw, with both players playing cautiously and avoiding any major risks.\n\n### Game 9: Nepomniachtchi–Ding, ½–½\n\nThe ninth game was a third consecutive draw, with both players agreeing to a peaceful result after just 30 moves.\n\n### Game 10: Ding–Nepomniachtchi, ½–½\n\nThe tenth game was another draw, with both players playing solidly and avoiding any major risks.\n\n### Game 11: Nepomniachtchi–Ding, ½–½\n\nThe eleventh game was a fifth consecutive draw, with both players agreeing to a peaceful result after just 30 moves.\n\n### Game 12: Ding–Nepomniachtchi, 1–0\n\nDing took the lead again in the twelfth game, using a powerful attack to overwhelm Nepomniachtchi's position.\n\n### Game 13: Nepomniachtchi–Ding, ½–½\n\nThe thirteenth game was another draw, with both players playing solidly and avoiding any major risks.\n\n### Game 14: Ding–Nepomniachtchi, ½–½\n\nThe fourteenth and final classical game was another draw, with both players agreeing to a peaceful result after just 30 moves.\n\n## Tie-break games\n\nAs the match was tied after 14 games, the players proceeded to a series of tiebreak games.

He grew up in a middle-class family with two siblings and developed an interest in acting at a young age. Caan attended Michigan State University, where he studied economics, but later transferred to Hofstra University, where he earned a degree in economics and began to pursue a career in acting.\n\n#Career\n\n##1960s\n\nCaan began his acting career in the early 1960s, landing small roles in off-Broadway productions and television shows. His breakthrough role came in 1964, when he played the lead in the Broadway production of \"Mandingo.\" He then transitioned to film, making his debut in the 1965 film \"Lady in a Cage.\" Throughout the decade, Caan appeared in a string of films, including \"The Glory Guys\" (1965), \"Games\" (1967), and \"Countdown\" (1967).\n\n##1970s\n\nThe 1970s were a pivotal time in Caan's career, as he began to take on more substantial roles in film. In 1971, he played the role of Santino \"Sonny\" Corleone in Francis Ford Coppola's epic crime saga \"The Godfather,\" a performance that earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Caan went on to appear in a range of films, including \"Cinderella Liberty\" (1973), \"The Gambler\" (1974), and \"Funny Lady\" (1975). He also made his directorial debut in 1978 with the film \"Hide in Plain Sight.\"\n\n##1980s\n\nIn the 1980s, Caan continued to establish himself as a leading man in Hollywood, appearing in films such as \"Thief\" (1981), \"Gardens of Stone\" (1987), and \"Alien Nation\" (1988).

In 1991, he played the role of Big Chris in the comedy film \"For the Boys,\" and in 1996, he appeared in the critically acclaimed film \"Bottle Rocket.\" Caan also began to make regular appearances on television, including a recurring role on the series \"Wiseguy\" in 1990.\n\n##2000s\n\nIn the 2000s, Caan continued to work steadily in film and television, appearing in a range of projects, including the films \"The Yards\" (2000), \"City of Ghosts\" (2002), and \"Elf\" (2003), in which he played the role of Walter Hobbs, the father of Will Ferrell's character.

Historians have long grappled with understanding the factors that contributed to the spread of Christianity throughout the empire, as well as the impact of this process on Roman society and culture. This article provides an overview of the historiography of the Christianization of the Roman Empire, including the history of the field, the spread of Christianity, and possible reasons for its growth.\n\n# History\n\n## Of historiography\n\nThe study of the Christianization of the Roman Empire has a long and complex history. Early Christian writers, such as Eusebius and Augustine, provided accounts of the spread of Christianity, but these works were often apologetic and polemical in nature. The Enlightenment saw a shift towards a more critical approach, with scholars such as Gibbon and Voltaire offering more nuanced assessments of the role of Christianity in the decline of the Roman Empire.\n\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries, historians such as Adolf von Harnack and Ernst Troeltsch developed more systematic approaches to the study of the Christianization of the Roman Empire. These scholars emphasized the importance of understanding the social and cultural context in which Christianity spread, and they drew on a range of sources, including archaeological evidence, inscriptions, and literary texts.\n\n## Roman religion\n\n### Context and other evidence\n\nRoman religion was a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that played a central role in the life of the Roman Empire. The Roman pantheon was a diverse collection of gods and goddesses, each with their own distinct characteristics and roles. Roman religion was also characterized by a strong emphasis on ritual and ceremony, with public festivals and sacrifices playing a key role in the life of the empire.\n\nIn addition to literary sources, archaeologists have uncovered a range of evidence that sheds light on Roman religion, including temples, altars, and inscriptions. These sources provide valuable insights into the practices and beliefs of Roman religion, and they help to contextualize the spread of Christianity.\n\n## Spread of Christianity\n\n### Origin\n\nChristianity originated in the 1st century AD, in the province of Judea, which was then part of the Roman Empire. The movement was founded by Jesus of Nazareth, who preached a message of salvation and redemption to his followers. After Jesus' death, his followers, led by the apostles, spread his teachings throughout the Mediterranean world.\n\n### Reception and growth in Roman society\n\nInitially, Christianity was met with skepticism and hostility by many Romans. Christians were seen as a threat to traditional Roman values and practices, and they faced persecution and marginalization. However, despite these challenges, Christianity continued to grow and spread throughout the empire.\n\n### Under Constantine and his Christian successors\n\nIn the 4th century AD, the Roman Empire underwent a significant transformation with the conversion of the Emperor Constantine to Christianity. Constantine's conversion marked a turning point in the history of the Christianization of the Roman Empire, as it provided Christians with official recognition and support.\n\nUnder Constantine and his Christian successors, Christianity became increasingly prominent in Roman society. Christians were appointed to key positions of power, and Christian buildings and monuments were constructed throughout the empire.\n\n### Theodosius I\n\nTheodosius I, who ruled the empire from 378 to 395 AD, played a crucial role in the Christianization of the Roman Empire. Theodosius was a devout Christian who saw himself as the protector of the faith. He issued a series of laws and edicts that promoted Christianity and suppressed paganism.\n\n#### Theodosius II and Pope Leo I\n\nTheodosius II, who ruled the empire from 408 to 450 AD, continued his father's policies of promoting Christianity. During his reign, the Pope Leo I played a significant role in shaping the Christianization of the Roman Empire. Leo was a skilled diplomat and theologian who helped to establish the authority of the papacy in the western Roman Empire.\n\n### Sixth to eighth centuries\n\nIn the 6th to 8th centuries AD, the Christianization of the Roman Empire continued to evolve. The empire faced significant challenges, including the rise of Islam and the decline of the western Roman Empire. Despite these challenges, Christianity continued to spread and deepen its roots in Roman society.\n\n# Mathematical modelling\n\nMathematical modelling has been used to study the spread of Christianity in the Roman Empire. These models use complex algorithms and statistical techniques to simulate the spread of Christianity and to identify key factors that contributed to its growth.\n\n# Possible reasons for a top-down spread\n\n## Traditional conflict models\n\nTraditional conflict models emphasize the role of conflict and coercion in the spread of Christianity. According to these models, Christianity was imposed on the Roman Empire through a combination of military conquest and imperial decree.\n\n## Violence and temple destruction\n\nViolence and temple destruction have been cited as factors that contributed to the spread of Christianity. Christian writers, such as Eusebius, reported instances of violence and destruction of pagan temples, which they saw as evidence of the triumph of Christianity.\n\n## Socio-economic factors\n\nSocio-economic factors, such as poverty and inequality, have been cited as factors that contributed to the spread of Christianity. Christianity offered a message of hope and salvation to those who were marginalized and oppressed.\n\n## Influence of legislation\n\nThe influence of legislation has been cited as a factor that contributed to the spread of Christianity. Roman laws and edicts, such as the Edict of Milan, provided official recognition and support for Christianity.\n\n# Possible reasons for a grassroots spread\n\n## New ideas\n\n### Inclusivity and exclusivity\n\nChristianity offered a new and inclusive message that appealed to people from all walks of life. The idea of salvation and redemption was seen as universal and accessible to all.\n\n### Kerygma (central message)\n\nThe kerygma, or central message, of Christianity was seen as a powerful and compelling message that resonated with people. The message of Jesus Christ was seen as a message of hope and salvation.\n\n## Social practices\n\n### Women\n\nWomen played a significant role in the spread of Christianity. Christian women, such as the martyrs Perpetua and Felicity, were seen as models of piety and devotion.\n\n### Sexual morality\n\nChristianity offered a new and strict code of sexual morality that appealed to people who were looking for a more disciplined and chaste way of life.\n\n### Care for the poor\n\nChristianity offered a message of care and compassion for the poor and marginalized. Christian communities, such as the early church in Jerusalem, were known for their charitable works and their care for the poor.\n\n### Health care\n\nChristianity offered a new and compassionate approach to health care. Christian hospitals and hospices were established throughout the empire, providing care and treatment for the sick and the dying.\n\n### Community\n\nChristianity offered a sense of community and belonging that appealed to people who were looking for a sense of connection and purpose.\n\n### Martyrdom\n\nMartyrdom was seen as a powerful witness to the faith. Christian martyrs, such as Saint Stephen and Saint Sebastian, were seen as heroes and models of devotion.\n\n### Miracles\n\nMiracles were seen as evidence of the power and authority of Christianity. Christian writers, such as Eusebius, reported instances of miracles and healings that were seen as proof of the divine origin of Christianity.\n\n# Alternative approaches\n\n## Network theory\n\nNetwork theory has been used to study the spread of Christianity in the Roman Empire. According to this approach, Christianity spread through a network of relationships and connections between individuals and communities.\n\n## Psychology\n\nPsychological factors, such as cognitive dissonance and social identity theory, have been used to study the spread of Christianity. According to this approach, Christianity spread because it offered a compelling and coherent worldview that resonated with people's psychological needs.\n\n## Evolution\n\nEvolutionary theory has been used to study the spread of Christianity. According to this approach, Christianity spread because it offered a set of adaptive traits that helped individuals and communities to survive and thrive in a changing environment.\n\n## Diffusion of innovation\n\nThe diffusion of innovation has been used to study the spread of Christianity. According to this approach, Christianity spread because it offered a new and innovative set of ideas and practices that were adopted by individuals and communities.\n\n# Effects\n\n## Judicial penalties and clemency\n\nThe Christianization of the Roman Empire had a significant impact on the judicial system. Christians were granted clemency and pardons, while pagans were subject to penalties and persecution.\n\n## Slavery\n\nThe Christianization of the Roman Empire had a significant impact on the institution of slavery. Christians were encouraged to treat their slaves with kindness and compassion, while pagans continued to view slaves as property.\n\n## Persecution of heretics\n\nThe Christianization of the Roman Empire led to the persecution of heretics and non-Christians. Christians were seen as the only true believers, while others were viewed as heretics and enemies of the faith.\n\n## Corruption\n\nThe Christianization of the Roman Empire led to corruption and abuse of power. Christian leaders and officials were accused of corruption and misusing their power.\n\n## Gladiator games\n\nThe Christianization of the Roman Empire led to the decline of gladiator games. Christians viewed the games as barbaric and cruel, while pagans continued to support them.\n\n## Intolerance\n\nThe Christianization of the Roman Empire led to intolerance and persecution of non-Christians. Christians viewed themselves as the only true believers, while others were viewed as heretics and enemies of the faith.\n\n## Difference in sexual morality\n\nThe Christianization of the Roman Empire led to a difference in sexual morality. Christians viewed sex as a sacred and exclusive act between husband and wife, while pagans viewed sex as a more permissive and liberating act.\n\n## Sanctity of life\n\nThe Christianization of the Roman Empire led to a greater emphasis on the sanctity of life. Christians viewed life as a gift from God, while pagans continued to view life as a more disposable and fleeting thing.\n\n## Education\n\nThe Christianization of the Roman Empire led to a greater emphasis on education. Christians viewed education as a key component of their faith, while pagans continued to view education as a more secondary and optional pursuit.\n\n## Sociological effects\n\nThe Christianization of the Roman Empire had a significant impact on society. Christians viewed themselves as a community of believers, while pagans continued to view themselves as individuals and citizens of the empire.\n\n## Law\n\nThe Christianization of the Roman Empire led to changes in the law. Christians viewed the law as a reflection of God's will, while pagans continued to view the law as a reflection of human will and power.\n\n# See also\n\n* Christianization of Europe\n* Decline of the Roman Empire\n* Early Christianity\n* Roman Empire\n\n# Notes\n\n# References\n\n# Bibliography", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Historiography_of_the_Christianization_of_the_Roman_Empire\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Of historiography\n##Roman religion\n###Context and other evidence\n##Spread of Christianity\n###Origin\n###Reception and growth in Roman society\n###Under Constantine and his Christian successors\n###Theodosius I\n####Theodosius II and Pope Leo I\n###Sixth to eighth centuries\n#Mathematical modelling\n#Possible reasons for a top-down spread\n##Traditional conflict models\n##Violence and temple destruction\n##Socio-economic factors\n##Influence of legislation\n#Possible reasons for a grassroots spread\n##New ideas\n###Inclusivity and exclusivity\n###Kerygma (central message)\n##Social practices\n###Women\n###Sexual morality\n###Care for the poor\n###Health care\n###Community\n###Martyrdom\n###Miracles\n#Alternative approaches\n##Network theory\n##Psychology\n##Evolution\n##Diffusion of innovation\n#Effects\n##Judicial penalties and clemency\n##Slavery\n##Persecution of heretics\n##Corruption\n##Gladiator games\n##Intolerance\n##Difference in sexual morality\n##Sanctity of life\n##Education\n##Sociological effects\n##Law\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Bibliography\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

During this period, a total of 83 tornadoes touched down across six states, causing widespread damage and loss of life. The outbreak was characterized by a complex weather pattern that developed over the southern Great Plains and evolved into a major severe weather event.\n\n# Meteorological Synopsis\n\n## March 5\n\nOn March 5, a strong low-pressure system developed over the southern Great Plains, with a trailing cold front stretching from the Texas Panhandle to the Midwest. As the system strengthened, a dry line formed across Oklahoma and Kansas, creating an area of instability that fueled the development of thunderstorms. By the afternoon, a mesoscale convective complex (MCC) had formed over eastern Oklahoma, producing large hail and damaging winds. As the MCC moved northeast, it interacted with the cold front, leading to the development of supercells that produced tornadoes.\n\n## March 6–7\n\nOver the next two days, the low-pressure system continued to move northeast, bringing the cold front and dry line with it. As the system interacted with a strong upper-level trough, the atmosphere became increasingly unstable, leading to a significant increase in severe weather activity. On March 6, a large outbreak of tornadoes occurred across the Midwest, with multiple long-lived supercells producing EF2 and EF3 tornadoes. The outbreak continued into the evening, with additional tornadoes touching down across the Ohio Valley. On March 7, the system began to weaken, but not before producing additional tornadoes across the Mid-Atlantic region.\n\n# Confirmed Tornadoes\n\n## March 5 Event\n\nA total of 13 tornadoes were confirmed on March 5, with the majority occurring in Oklahoma and Kansas. The strongest tornado of the day was an EF2 that touched down in Creek County, Oklahoma, causing significant damage to homes and businesses.\n\n## March 6 Event\n\nOn March 6, a total of 46 tornadoes were confirmed, with the majority occurring in Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio. The strongest tornado of the day was an EF3 that touched down in Madison County, Illinois, causing widespread damage and injuring multiple people.\n\n## March 7 Event\n\nOn March 7, a total of 24 tornadoes were confirmed, with the majority occurring in West Virginia, Virginia, and Maryland. The strongest tornado of the day was an EF2 that touched down in Greenbrier County, West Virginia, causing significant damage to homes and businesses.\n\n## Macksburg–Winterset–Norwalk–Colfax–Newton, Iowa\n\nOne of the most significant tornadoes of the outbreak occurred on March 5, when an EF4 tornado touched down in Madison County, Iowa. The tornado caused widespread damage and loss of life, with a total of 6 fatalities and over 50 injuries. The tornado was on the ground for over 60 miles, making it one of the longest-lived tornadoes of the outbreak.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe tornado outbreak of March 5–7, 2022, had a significant impact on the affected regions. A total of 6 fatalities and over 100 injuries were reported, with widespread damage to homes, businesses, and infrastructure. The total damage was estimated to be over $1 billion, making it one of the costliest severe weather events in U.S. history. The outbreak also had a significant impact on the agricultural industry, with widespread damage to crops and livestock.\n\n# See Also\n\n* List of tornado outbreaks\n* Tornadoes in the United States\n* Severe weather events in the United States\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a factual account of the tornado outbreak of March 5–7, 2022.

The case has garnered significant attention due to the ongoing disputes between Archie's family and the medical professionals treating him, as well as the interventions of various third parties and government officials.\n\n# Incident\n\nOn April 7, 2022, Archie Battersbee, a 12-year-old boy from Southend-on-Sea, Essex, was found unresponsive at his home with a ligature around his neck. He was rushed to Southend University Hospital, where he was placed on a ventilator and diagnosed with a severe brain injury. The incident was initially reported as a possible accident, but it was later revealed that Archie had been participating in an online challenge that involved strangulation.\n\n# Legal cases\n\nThe Archie Battersbee case has involved several legal proceedings, including applications to the High Court and the Court of Appeal. The primary dispute has centered on the question of whether Archie should be allowed to continue receiving life-sustaining treatment, including ventilation and nutrition, or whether it would be in his best interests to withdraw such treatment and allow him to die.\n\nIn May 2022, Archie's parents, Paul Battersbee and Hollie Dance, applied to the High Court for an order requiring the hospital to continue providing life-sustaining treatment to their son. However, the hospital and the NHS trust responsible for Archie's care opposed the application, arguing that it would not be in Archie's best interests to continue receiving treatment.\n\n# Inquest\n\nAn inquest into Archie's death was opened in July 2022, but it was later adjourned pending the outcome of the ongoing legal proceedings. The inquest is expected to resume at a later date, once the legal disputes have been resolved.\n\n# Timeline\n\n## April 2022\n\n* April 7: Archie Battersbee is found unresponsive at his home with a ligature around his neck.\n* April 8: Archie is rushed to Southend University Hospital, where he is placed on a ventilator and diagnosed with a severe brain injury.\n\n## May 2022\n\n* May 3: Archie's parents apply to the High Court for an order requiring the hospital to continue providing life-sustaining treatment to their son.\n* May 11: The hospital and the NHS trust responsible for Archie's care oppose the application, arguing that it would not be in Archie's best interests to continue receiving treatment.\n* May 13: The High Court hears the application and reserves its judgment.\n\n## June 2022\n\n* June 6: The High Court delivers its judgment, ruling that it would not be in Archie's best interests to continue receiving life-sustaining treatment.\n* June 8: Archie's parents appeal the decision to the Court of Appeal.\n\n## July 2022\n\n* July 11: The Court of Appeal hears the appeal and reserves its judgment.\n* July 14: The inquest into Archie's death is opened, but it is later adjourned pending the outcome of the ongoing legal proceedings.\n\n## August 2022\n\n* August 1: The Court of Appeal delivers its judgment, upholding the High Court's decision and ruling that it would not be in Archie's best interests to continue receiving life-sustaining treatment.\n* August 3: Archie's parents apply to the Supreme Court for permission to appeal the decision.\n\n## September 2022\n\n* September 5: The Supreme Court refuses permission for Archie's parents to appeal the decision.\n* September 6: Archie's parents announce that they will not pursue further legal action and will allow their son to die.\n\n## November 2022\n\n* November 1: Archie's life-sustaining treatment is withdrawn, and he dies shortly thereafter.\n\n## February 2023\n\n* February 2: The inquest into Archie's death is resumed, with the coroner delivering a narrative verdict.\n\n# Summary of judgments\n\nThe High Court, Court of Appeal, and Supreme Court have all delivered judgments in the Archie Battersbee case. The key findings of these judgments are as follows:\n\n* The High Court ruled that it would not be in Archie's best interests to continue receiving life-sustaining treatment.\n* The Court of Appeal upheld the High Court's decision, ruling that it would not be in Archie's best interests to continue receiving life-sustaining treatment.\n* The Supreme Court refused permission for Archie's parents to appeal the decision, effectively ending the legal proceedings.\n\n# Third party involvement and media analysis\n\nThe Archie Battersbee case has attracted significant attention from third parties, including politicians, religious groups, and media commentators.\n\n## Christian Legal Centre\n\nThe Christian Legal Centre, a conservative Christian organization, has been involved in the case, providing support to Archie's parents and advocating for the continuation of life-sustaining treatment.\n\n## MP's letter for treatment abroad\n\nIn July 2022, a group of MPs wrote to the government, calling for Archie to be allowed to receive treatment abroad. However, the government rejected the request, citing the court's ruling that it would not be in Archie's best interests to continue receiving treatment.\n\n## GoFundMe page\n\nA GoFundMe page was set up to support Archie's family and to raise funds for his treatment. However, the page was later closed, with the funds raised being used to support the family in other ways.\n\n# Family campaigns\n\nArchie's family has been actively campaigning for the continuation of life-sustaining treatment, arguing that it is in his best interests to receive treatment and that he has the potential to recover.\n\n# See also\n\n* Right to die\n* Euthanasia\n* Assisted dying\n* Medical ethics\n* Palliative care", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Archie_Battersbee_case\" following this outline:\n\n#Incident\n#Legal cases\n#Inquest\n#Timeline\n##April 2022\n##May 2022\n##June 2022\n##July 2022\n##August 2022\n##September 2022\n##November 2022\n##February 2023\n#Summary of judgments\n#Third party involvement and media analysis\n##Christian Legal Centre\n##MP's letter for treatment abroad\n##GoFundMe page\n#Family campaigns\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

His metaphysical and epistemological ideas had a profound impact on Western philosophy, influencing many notable thinkers throughout history, including philosophers, theologians, and mystics. This article explores Plotinus's life, major ideas, and influence on Western thought.\n\nBiography\n------------\n\n### Expedition to Persia and return to Rome\n\nPlotinus was born in Lycopolis, Egypt, around 205 AD. Little is known about his early life, but it is believed that he was educated in Alexandria, where he studied philosophy under the tutelage of Ammonius Saccas. In his late 20s, Plotinus joined the Roman Emperor Gordian III's expedition to Persia, hoping to learn from the Persian philosophers and gain a deeper understanding of Eastern thought. However, the expedition was unsuccessful, and Plotinus was forced to flee to Antioch.\n\nAfter the death of Gordian III, Plotinus traveled to Rome, where he established a school of philosophy and attracted a circle of influential students, including Porphyry, Amelius, and Eustochius. In Rome, Plotinus taught philosophy for over 20 years, developing his metaphysical system and writing numerous treatises.\n\n### Later life\n\nPlotinus's later life was marked by illness and physical decline. Despite his poor health, he continued to teach and write, producing some of his most important works. In his final years, Plotinus retired to the countryside, where he died around 270 AD.\n\nMajor ideas\n-------------\n\n### The One\n\nAt the heart of Plotinus's metaphysics is the concept of the One (Greek: τὸ ἕν), the ultimate, uncaused, and eternal source of all existence. The One is beyond being and non-being, and it is the unity that underlies all multiplicity. The One is often described as the \"source\" or \"principle\" of all things, but it is not a creator in the classical sense.\n\n### Emanation by the One\n\nAccording to Plotinus, the One emanates the Intellect (Greek: νοῦς), the realm of being and thought. The Intellect is the first hypostasis, or level of reality, and it is the source of all forms and ideas. The Intellect, in turn, emanates the Soul (Greek: ψυχή), the realm of life and movement. The Soul is the second hypostasis, and it is responsible for the creation of the material world.\n\n### The true human and happiness\n\nFor Plotinus, the true human is not the physical body but the soul, which is a spark of the divine. The goal of human life is to attain happiness and fulfillment, which can only be achieved through the realization of one's true nature. This realization is possible through philosophical contemplation and the cultivation of virtues.\n\n### Henosis\n\nHenosis (Greek: ἕνωσις) is the ultimate goal of human existence, according to Plotinus. It is the union of the individual soul with the One, the source of all existence. Henosis is not a physical or material union but a spiritual and intellectual one. It is achieved through the cultivation of virtues, the practice of contemplation, and the realization of one's true nature.\n\nRelation with contemporary philosophy and religion\n------------------------------------------------\n\n### Plotinus's Relation to Plato\n\nPlotinus was deeply influenced by the philosophy of Plato, and his metaphysics can be seen as a development of Plato's ideas. However, Plotinus also critiqued and modified certain aspects of Plato's thought, such as the theory of forms. Plotinus's concept of the One is also distinct from Plato's concept of the Good.\n\n### Plotinus and the Gnostics\n\nPlotinus was critical of Gnosticism, a contemporary philosophical and religious movement that emphasized the importance of secret knowledge (gnosis) for salvation. Plotinus saw Gnosticism as a form of pseudo-philosophy that relied on arbitrary and unproven assertions. He also critiqued the Gnostics' rejection of the material world and their emphasis on the attainment of gnosis through rituals and practices.\n\n### Against causal astrology\n\nPlotinus was also critical of astrology, which was widely practiced in the ancient world. He argued that the stars and planets do not have a direct influence on human affairs and that the universe is governed by rational and deterministic laws.\n\nFilm studies\n------------\n\nThere is no direct connection between Plotinus and film studies, as film as a medium did not exist during his lifetime. However, Plotinus's ideas on the nature of reality, the human condition, and the importance of contemplation and introspection have influenced many filmmakers and film theorists.\n\nInfluence\n------------\n\n### Ancient world\n\nPlotinus's ideas had a significant impact on the development of Western philosophy, particularly in the areas of metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics. His influence can be seen in the works of later philosophers, such as Porphyry, Iamblichus, and Proclus.\n\n### Christianity\n\nPlotinus's ideas also influenced early Christian thought, particularly in the areas of theology and mysticism. The concept of the One and the idea of henosis can be seen in the works of early Christian theologians, such as Origen and Gregory of Nyssa.\n\n### Islam\n\nPlotinus's ideas also influenced Islamic philosophy, particularly in the areas of metaphysics and epistemology. The concept of the One and the idea of emanation can be seen in the works of Islamic philosophers, such as Al-Farabi and Ibn Sina.\n\n### Judaism\n\nPlotinus's ideas also influenced Jewish philosophy, particularly in the areas of metaphysics and mysticism. The concept of the One and the idea of henosis can be seen in the works of Jewish philosophers, such as Maimonides and Isaac Luria.\n\n### Renaissance\n\nPlotinus's ideas experienced a revival during the Renaissance, particularly in the areas of art and literature. The concept of the One and the idea of henosis can be seen in the works of Renaissance artists and writers, such as Michelangelo and Shakespeare.\n\n### Great Britain\n\nPlotinus's ideas also influenced British literature and philosophy, particularly in the areas of Romanticism and Idealism. The concept of the One and the idea of henosis can be seen in the works of British writers and philosophers, such as William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge.\n\n### India\n\nPlotinus's ideas also influenced Indian philosophy, particularly in the areas of Advaita Vedanta and Kashmir Shaivism. The concept of the One and the idea of henosis can be seen in the works of Indian philosophers, such as Adi Shankara and Abhinavagupta.\n\nSee also\n----------\n\n* Neoplatonism\n* Plato\n* Aristotle\n* Stoicism\n* Epicureanism\n* Gnosticism\n* Mysticism\n* Theurgy\n\nNotes\n------\n\nThis article is a general overview of Plotinus's life and ideas.

The battle was a key part of the larger 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and resulted in significant loss of life and displacement of civilians.\n\n# Background\n\n## War in Donbas\n\nThe Donbas region of eastern Ukraine has been the site of ongoing conflict since 2014, when pro-Russian separatists declared independence from Ukraine and established the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) and the Luhansk People's Republic (LPR). The conflict escalated into a full-scale war between Ukraine and Russian-backed separatists, with Russia providing military and economic support to the separatists.\n\n## Prior operations\n\nIn the years leading up to the 2022 invasion, Ukrainian and Russian forces had engaged in numerous battles and skirmishes in the Donbas region. In 2019, Ukrainian forces launched a major operation to retake the city of Debaltseve, which had been under separatist control since 2015. The operation was successful, but at great cost in lives and equipment.\n\n# Prelude\n\n## Russian objectives\n\nIn the months leading up to the 2022 invasion, Russia had amassed a large military force on the border with Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that the goal of the invasion was to \"denazify\" Ukraine and protect ethnic Russians living in the Donbas region. However, Ukraine and its allies saw the invasion as an attempt by Russia to annex the Donbas region and destroy Ukraine's independence.\n\n# Opposing forces and foreign involvement\n\n## Russian and pro-Russian forces\n\nThe Russian military had a significant presence in the Donbas region, with thousands of troops and hundreds of tanks and artillery pieces. The separatist forces of the DPR and LPR were also well-armed and well-trained, with support from Russian military advisers. In addition, Russia had deployed a large number of mercenaries and private military contractors to the region.\n\n## Ukrainian forces\n\nThe Ukrainian military had a significant presence in the Donbas region, with thousands of troops and hundreds of tanks and artillery pieces. The Ukrainian military had also received significant support from foreign countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada.\n\n### Foreign support for Ukraine\n\nUkraine received significant military and economic support from foreign countries during the battle. The United States provided Ukraine with billions of dollars in military aid, including Javelin anti-tank missiles and HIMARS rocket artillery systems. The United Kingdom provided Ukraine with military training and equipment, while Canada provided Ukraine with military aid and humanitarian assistance.\n\n# Battle\n\n## Early operations (April–May 2022)\n\nThe battle began in early April 2022, when Russian forces launched a major attack on Ukrainian positions in the Donbas region. The attack was focused on the cities of Popasna, Donetsk, and Luhansk, and was supported by heavy artillery and air strikes.\n\n### Popasna\n\nThe city of Popasna was a key target for Russian forces, as it controlled access to the city of Luhansk. Ukrainian forces defended the city fiercely, but were eventually forced to retreat. The city was heavily damaged during the fighting, with many buildings destroyed and civilians killed.\n\n### Donetsk Oblast\n\nRussian forces also launched a major attack on Ukrainian positions in Donetsk Oblast, which was supported by heavy artillery and air strikes. Ukrainian forces defended their positions fiercely, but were eventually forced to retreat.\n\n### Luhansk Oblast\n\nRussian forces also launched a major attack on Ukrainian positions in Luhansk Oblast, which was supported by heavy artillery and air strikes. Ukrainian forces defended their positions fiercely, but were eventually forced to retreat.\n\n### Izium–Sloviansk front\n\nThe Izium–Sloviansk front was a key area of fighting during the battle. Russian forces launched a major attack on Ukrainian positions in the area, which was supported by heavy artillery and air strikes. Ukrainian forces defended their positions fiercely, but were eventually forced to retreat.\n\n## Capture of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk, attempted advance on Sloviansk (May–July 2022)\n\n### Capture of Lyman and Sviatohirsk\n\nRussian forces captured the cities of Lyman and Sviatohirsk in May 2022, which gave them control of the Donets River and access to the city of Sievierodonetsk.\n\n### Izium–Sloviansk front\n\nRussian forces continued to attack Ukrainian positions on the Izium–Sloviansk front, but were unable to break through.\n\n### Popasna–Bakhmut front\n\nRussian forces launched a major attack on Ukrainian positions on the Popasna–Bakhmut front, but were unable to break through.\n\n### Sievierodonetsk front\n\nRussian forces launched a major attack on Ukrainian positions in Sievierodonetsk, which was supported by heavy artillery and air strikes. Ukrainian forces defended their positions fiercely, but were eventually forced to retreat.\n\n### Fall of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk\n\nThe cities of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk fell to Russian forces in July 2022, which gave them control of the entire Luhansk Oblast.\n\n## Russian operational pause (4–16 July 2022)\n\nRussian forces paused their operations in mid-July 2022, which gave them time to regroup and reorganize.\n\n# Renewed assaults in Donetsk Oblast (17 July–6 September 2022)\n\n## Russian assaults near Bakhmut, Soledar, and Siversk\n\nRussian forces launched a major attack on Ukrainian positions near Bakhmut, Soledar, and Siversk, which was supported by heavy artillery and air strikes.

The floods were caused by heavy monsoon rains and melting glaciers, which resulted in widespread damage and loss of life across the country. The disaster was described as one of the worst in Pakistan's history, with thousands of people killed or displaced and billions of dollars in damages.\n\n#Background\n\nPakistan is prone to flooding due to its geography and climate. The country is located in South Asia, where the monsoon season brings heavy rainfall every year. The Indus River, which runs through the heart of Pakistan, is also a major factor in the country's flooding. The river and its tributaries are prone to overflowing during the monsoon season, causing widespread flooding in the surrounding areas.\n\nIn the summer of 2022, Pakistan experienced a particularly intense monsoon season, with heavy rainfall in July and August. The rainfall was exacerbated by melting glaciers in the north of the country, which added to the water levels in the rivers. The resulting floods were the worst in Pakistan's history, affecting over 30 million people and causing billions of dollars in damages.\n\n#Impact\n\nThe 2022 Pakistan floods had a devastating impact on the country, with widespread damage and loss of life reported across the nation.\n\n##Sindh\n\nSindh was one of the hardest-hit provinces in Pakistan, with thousands of people affected by the floods. The province's major cities, including Karachi and Hyderabad, were severely flooded, with many residents forced to flee their homes. The floods also caused widespread damage to crops and infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and buildings.\n\n##Balochistan\n\nBalochistan was also severely affected by the floods, with many areas of the province left inaccessible due to the damage. The province's major cities, including Quetta and Gwadar, were flooded, and many residents were forced to flee their homes. The floods also caused widespread damage to crops and infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and buildings.\n\n##Khyber Pakhtunkhwa\n\nKhyber Pakhtunkhwa was another province severely affected by the floods, with thousands of people affected. The province's major cities, including Peshawar and Mardan, were flooded, and many residents were forced to flee their homes. The floods also caused widespread damage to crops and infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and buildings.\n\n##Gilgit-Baltistan\n\nGilgit-Baltistan was also affected by the floods, with many areas of the province left inaccessible due to the damage. The province's major cities, including Gilgit and Skardu, were flooded, and many residents were forced to flee their homes. The floods also caused widespread damage to crops and infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and buildings.\n\n##Punjab\n\nPunjab was also affected by the floods, with many areas of the province left inaccessible due to the damage. The province's major cities, including Lahore and Multan, were flooded, and many residents were forced to flee their homes. The floods also caused widespread damage to crops and infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and buildings.\n\n##Azad Kashmir\n\nAzad Kashmir was also affected by the floods, with many areas of the province left inaccessible due to the damage. The province's major cities, including Muzaffarabad and Rawalakot, were flooded, and many residents were forced to flee their homes. The floods also caused widespread damage to crops and infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and buildings.\n\n#Response\n\nThe response to the 2022 Pakistan floods was led by the government, with support from international organizations, countries, and the corporate sector.\n\n##National\n\nThe government of Pakistan responded quickly to the floods, with the prime minister declaring a national emergency. The government established a national flood response center, which coordinated the relief efforts across the country. The military was also deployed to assist in the relief efforts, with thousands of troops involved in rescue and relief operations.\n\n##International\n\nThe international community responded quickly to the floods, with many countries and organizations offering assistance.\n\n###International Organizations\n\nThe United Nations was one of the first organizations to respond to the floods, with the UN secretary-general offering condolences to the people of Pakistan. The UN also launched a flash appeal for $160 million to support the relief efforts.\n\n###Countries\n\nMany countries also offered assistance to Pakistan, including the United States, China, and the European Union. The United States provided $30 million in aid, while China provided $100 million. The European Union also provided €10 million in aid.\n\n###Corporate Sector\n\nThe corporate sector also responded to the floods, with many companies offering assistance. The Pakistani business community also came together to raise funds for the relief efforts.\n\n###Private Individuals\n\nMany private individuals also responded to the floods, with thousands of people donating to relief efforts. Social media played a major role in raising awareness and funds for the relief efforts.\n\n#Army helicopter crash\n\nOn August 1, 2022, an army helicopter crashed while on a relief mission in Balochistan, killing all six people on board.

The strikes resulted in production delays and cancellations for many shows, as well as a reduced number of new episodes for the season. The strikes also led to a greater reliance on reality television and reruns to fill the programming gaps.

The pillar, erected by the Mauryan emperor Ashoka in 250 BCE, was one of several pillars of the Dharmachakra, or \"Wheel of the Law,\" that were placed throughout northern India. The Lion Capital, also known as the Sarnath Lion Capital, is now considered one of the most iconic symbols of India and is depicted on the country's national emblem.\n\n# History\n\nThe Lion Capital of Ashoka was created during the reign of Emperor Ashoka, who ruled the Mauryan Empire from 269 to 232 BCE. Ashoka, who converted to Buddhism after a brutal war in Kalinga, was a prolific builder of monuments and public works. He erected several pillars, known as the Ashoka Pillars, throughout his empire to spread Buddhist teachings and to mark important sites. The Lion Capital was placed atop one of these pillars at Sarnath, a major Buddhist site near Varanasi, India.\n\nThe Lion Capital was likely carved by skilled artisans from the Mauryan court. The sculpture is made of sandstone and is remarkable for its intricate details and precision. The lions, which are depicted in a naturalistic style, are shown standing back to back, with their bodies turned slightly outward. The circular base of the sculpture is decorated with a frieze of four animals: a bull, a horse, an elephant, and a lion. The frieze is topped with a crown of wheels, which represents the Dharmachakra, or the \"Wheel of the Law.\"\n\n# Excavation and display\n\nThe Lion Capital of Ashoka was excavated in 1906 by the British archaeologist Friedrich Oscar Oertel. The sculpture was found in fragments, and Oertel was able to reassemble it. The Lion Capital was initially placed in the Lucknow Museum, where it was displayed as a major artifact of Indian history. In 1947, the sculpture was moved to the Sarnath Museum, where it is currently displayed.\n\n# Description\n\nThe Lion Capital of Ashoka is a remarkable sculpture that is notable for its intricate details and precision. The lions, which are depicted in a naturalistic style, are shown standing back to back, with their bodies turned slightly outward. The lions are seated on a circular base, which is decorated with a frieze of four animals: a bull, a horse, an elephant, and a lion. The frieze is topped with a crown of wheels, which represents the Dharmachakra, or the \"Wheel of the Law.\" The lions are shown with their mouths open, as if roaring, and their paws are extended, as if reaching outward.\n\nThe sculpture is made of sandstone and is approximately 2 meters (6.6 feet) in height. The lions are carved in a realistic style, with attention to detail and texture. The sculpture is notable for its sense of movement and energy, as if the lions are about to spring to life.\n\n## Symbolism\n\nThe Lion Capital of Ashoka is rich in symbolism and meaning. The lions, which are depicted in a naturalistic style, represent bravery, strength, and courage. The circular base of the sculpture, which is decorated with a frieze of four animals, represents the unity and diversity of the Mauryan Empire. The crown of wheels, which tops the frieze, represents the Dharmachakra, or the \"Wheel of the Law,\" which is a central symbol of Buddhism.\n\nThe Lion Capital is also notable for its use of animal imagery, which was a common feature of Mauryan art. The animals depicted in the frieze, including the bull, the horse, the elephant, and the lion, represent different aspects of the natural world and the human experience. The bull, for example, represents strength and fertility, while the horse represents speed and agility.\n\n## Influences\n\nThe Lion Capital of Ashoka was influenced by a range of artistic and cultural traditions, including ancient Greek and Persian art. The sculpture's use of naturalistic motifs, such as the lions and the frieze of animals, was influenced by ancient Greek art, which emphasized realism and attention to detail. The sculpture's use of symbolic motifs, such as the crown of wheels, was influenced by ancient Persian art, which emphasized the use of symbols and imagery to convey meaning.\n\nThe Lion Capital was also influenced by the artistic traditions of the Mauryan court, which emphasized the use of intricate details and precision. The sculpture's use of sandstone and its intricate carvings were characteristic of Mauryan art, which emphasized the use of local materials and techniques.\n\n# Legacy\n\nThe Lion Capital of Ashoka has had a profound impact on Indian art and culture. The sculpture's use of naturalistic motifs and symbolic imagery has influenced a range of artistic traditions, including Indian sculpture, painting, and architecture. The Lion Capital's use of animal imagery, for example, has influenced the development of Indian art, which often features animals and other natural motifs.\n\nThe Lion Capital has also played an important role in Indian national identity and symbolism. The sculpture is depicted on the Indian national emblem, which is used on government buildings, currency, and other official documents. The Lion Capital is also featured on a range of Indian coins and stamps, and is widely regarded as one of the country's most iconic symbols.\n\n# Reconstructions\n\nThe Lion Capital of Ashoka has undergone several reconstructions and restorations over the years. The sculpture was initially reassembled by Friedrich Oscar Oertel in 1906, after it was excavated in fragments. The sculpture was later restored by Indian conservators, who used traditional techniques and materials to repair damaged areas.\n\nIn recent years, the Lion Capital has undergone further restoration work, which has aimed to stabilize the sculpture and prevent further damage. The restoration work has been carried out by Indian conservators, who have used advanced techniques and materials to repair damaged areas and stabilize the sculpture.\n\n# Related sculpture\n\nThe Lion Capital of Ashoka is part of a broader tradition of Indian sculpture, which emphasizes the use of naturalistic motifs and symbolic imagery. Other notable examples of Indian sculpture include the Sanchi Stupa, which features intricate carvings and sculptures of Buddhist deities, and the Khajuraho Group of Monuments, which features intricate sculptures of Hindu deities and mythological creatures.\n\nThe Lion Capital is also related to other sculptures of the Mauryan period, which emphasize the use of naturalistic motifs and symbolic imagery. Other notable examples of Mauryan sculpture include the Ashoka Pillars, which feature intricate carvings and sculptures of Buddhist deities, and the Didarganj Yakshi, which features a sculpture of a female figure with intricate carvings and ornamentation.\n\n# Notes\n\n* The Lion Capital of Ashoka is considered one of the most iconic symbols of India and is depicted on the country's national emblem.\n* The sculpture was created during the reign of Emperor Ashoka, who ruled the Mauryan Empire from 269 to 232 BCE.\n* The Lion Capital was influenced by a range of artistic and cultural traditions, including ancient Greek and Persian art.\n* The sculpture has undergone several reconstructions and restorations over the years, including a major restoration project in the 1990s.\n* The Lion Capital is considered a masterpiece of Indian art and is widely regarded as one of the country's most iconic symbols.\n\n# References\n\n* *Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements.*\n\n# Cited works\n\n* *Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements.*\n\n# Further reading\n\n* *Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements.*\n\n# External links\n\n* *Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements.*", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Lion_Capital_of_Ashoka\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n#Excavation and display\n#Description\n#Symbolism\n#Influences\n#Legacy\n#Reconstructions\n#Related sculpture\n#Notes\n#References\n#Cited works\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The election marked the third general election under the 2010 Constitution of Kenya, which established a presidential system and a bicameral legislature.\n\n#Background\n\nThe 2022 general election was a significant event in Kenya's democratic history, with the country experiencing its third peaceful transfer of power since the introduction of multiparty democracy in 1992. The election was also notable for the high number of aspirants vying for various positions, with over 8,000 candidates contesting for seats in the National Assembly, Senate, and county assemblies.\n\nThe election was also marked by a number of challenges, including concerns over the independence of the electoral commission, the use of technology in the electoral process, and the role of money in politics. Despite these challenges, the election was widely seen as an opportunity for Kenyans to exercise their democratic rights and shape the country's future.\n\n#Electoral system\n\nKenya uses a mixed electoral system, which combines elements of first-past-the-post and proportional representation. The President is elected using a simple majority system, where the candidate with the most votes wins. Members of the National Assembly are elected using a first-past-the-post system, where the candidate with the most votes in each constituency wins. Members of the Senate are elected using a proportional representation system, where each county is allocated a certain number of seats based on its population.\n\n#Presidential candidates\n\nA total of four candidates contested for the presidency in the 2022 general election. The main candidates were:\n\n* Raila Odinga, the leader of the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) and the Azimio la Umoja coalition\n* William Ruto, the Deputy President of Kenya and the leader of the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) and the Kenya Kwanza coalition\n* George Wajackoyah, the leader of the Roots Party of Kenya\n* David Waihiga Mwaure, the leader of the Agano Party\n\n#Campaign\n\n##Presidential nomination\n\nThe presidential nomination process was marked by controversy, with some candidates facing challenges in securing their parties' nominations. Raila Odinga, for example, faced opposition from some members of his party, who accused him of imposing himself as the party's candidate.\n\n##Deputy presidential nomination\n\nThe selection of running mates was also a contentious issue, with some candidates facing opposition from their parties' members. William Ruto, for example, faced opposition from some members of his party, who accused him of imposing his running mate, Rigathi Gachagua.\n\n##Manifestos\n\nThe presidential candidates launched their manifestos in the run-up to the election, outlining their plans for the country's development. Raila Odinga's manifesto, for example, focused on issues such as poverty reduction, healthcare, and education.

The election will be the 13th assembly election in the state since its formation in 1972. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is seeking re-election for a second consecutive term, while the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI(M)) and the Indian National Congress are aiming to regain power in the state.\n\n#Background\n\n##TTAADC elections\n\nIn 2021, the Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council (TTAADC) elections were held, in which the Tipra Motha Party (TMP) won 18 out of 28 seats, while the BJP won 9 seats. The CPI(M) failed to win a single seat. The TMP's victory in the TTAADC elections was seen as a significant development in the state's politics, as it marked the emergence of a new regional party.\n\n##Major political defections\n\nIn the run-up to the 2023 assembly election, several politicians defected from one party to another. In October 2022, six MLAs of the CPI(M) defected to the BJP, reducing the CPI(M)'s strength in the assembly to 15. In January 2023, two MLAs of the BJP defected to the TMP. These defections are expected to have an impact on the election outcome.\n\n#Schedule\n\nThe Election Commission of India (ECI) announced the election schedule on January 18, 2023.

The party has fielded several prominent tribal leaders and is expected to do well in the tribal-dominated areas.\n\n##Others\n\nSeveral other parties, including the All India Trinamool Congress (AITC) and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), are also contesting the election. However, they are not expected to win many seats.\n\n#Candidates\n\nA total of 259 candidates are contesting the election.

The teachers were recruited in 2010, but their appointments were later found to be irregular. The BJP government has defended its decision, saying that it was taken to ensure the quality of education in the state.\n\n##Tipraland Movement\n\nThe TMP has been demanding the creation of a separate state for the indigenous people of Tripura. The party has promised to raise the issue in the assembly if it comes to power.\n\n##Bru refugees\n\nThe presence of Bru refugees in the state has become a contentious issue. The BJP government has been accused of failing to rehabilitate the refugees, who have been living in camps for several years.\n\n#Campaigns\n\n##Bharatiya Janata Party\n\nThe BJP has launched a high-pitched campaign, with several top leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah, addressing rallies in the state. The party has promised to continue its development agenda if it comes back to power.\n\n##Communist Party of India (Marxist)\n\nThe CPI(M) has launched a campaign focused on the BJP government's alleged failures, including its handling of the economy and the law and order situation. The party has promised to restore the state's economy and provide good governance if it comes to power.\n\n##Indian National Congress\n\nThe Congress has launched a campaign focused on the BJP government's alleged misrule and corruption. The party has promised to provide a clean and transparent government if it comes to power.\n\n##Tipra Motha Party\n\nThe TMP has launched a campaign focused on the issues of the indigenous people, including the demand for a separate state. The party has promised to raise the voice of the indigenous people in the assembly if it comes to power.\n\n#Incidents\n\nSeveral incidents of violence have been reported during the campaign. On January 25, 2023, a BJP worker was injured in a clash with CPI(M) supporters in the Agartala constituency. On January 30, 2023, a TMP worker was injured in a clash with BJP supporters in the Khowai constituency.\n\n#Surveys & Polls\n\nSeveral opinion polls have been conducted in the run-up to the election. A poll conducted by the India Today Group in January 2023 predicted a close contest between the BJP and the SDF, with the BJP likely to win 30-35 seats and the SDF likely to win 25-30 seats. A poll conducted by the ABP News in January 2023 predicted a BJP victory, with the party likely to win 35-40 seats.\n\n#Results\n\n##Results by alliance and party\n\nThe final results are expected to be declared on March 2, 2023.\n\n##Results by district\n\nThe final results are expected to be declared on March 2, 2023.\n\n##Results by constituency\n\nThe final results are expected to be declared on March 2, 2023.\n\n#Government formation\n\nThe party or alliance that wins a majority of seats will form the next government in the state.\n\n#Aftermath\n\nThe outcome of the election will have a significant impact on the state's politics and governance.

The mission aims to demonstrate a planetary defense technique that could potentially be used to prevent an asteroid from colliding with Earth in the future. In this article, we will explore the mission history, description, spacecraft design, and profile of the DART mission.\n\n# Mission history\n\nThe DART mission was first proposed in 2011 by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) and the NASA Planetary Science Division. The mission was initially designed to be part of the Asteroid Impact and Deflection Assessment (AIDA) mission, a collaborative effort between NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA). However, the AIDA mission was later canceled, and the DART mission was re-scoped to focus solely on the kinetic impactor demonstration.\n\nIn 2015, NASA selected the APL to lead the DART mission, with a planned launch date in 2020. However, due to various delays, the launch was postponed to 2021. The DART spacecraft was launched on November 24, 2021, aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California.\n\n# Description\n\n## Spacecraft\n\nThe DART spacecraft is a compact, box-shaped vehicle measuring approximately 1.2 meters (4 feet) on each side. The spacecraft has a mass of around 610 kilograms (1,345 pounds) and is equipped with a range of instruments and systems designed to support the mission.\n\n### Camera\n\nThe DART spacecraft is equipped with a single camera, known as the Didymos Reconnaissance and Asteroid Camera for Optical navigation (DRACO). The DRACO camera is a high-resolution instrument designed to capture images of the target asteroid, Didymos, and its smaller moon, Dimorphos.\n\n### Solar arrays\n\nThe DART spacecraft is powered by two solar arrays, each measuring 2.3 meters (7.5 feet) long and 1.1 meters (3.6 feet) wide. The solar arrays provide a total power output of around 1.5 kilowatts.\n\n### Antenna\n\nThe DART spacecraft is equipped with a high-gain antenna, which provides communication with Earth via radio waves. The antenna has a diameter of 1 meter (3.3 feet) and is capable of transmitting data at speeds of up to 2 megabits per second.\n\n### Ion thruster\n\nThe DART spacecraft is equipped with an ion thruster, which provides a high-efficiency propulsion system for the mission. The ion thruster uses xenon gas as a propellant and is capable of producing a thrust of around 0.5 newtons.\n\n## Secondary spacecraft\n\nIn addition to the primary DART spacecraft, the mission also includes a secondary spacecraft known as the LICIACube (Light Italian CubeSat for Imaging of Asteroids). The LICIACube is a small, CubeSat-sized spacecraft designed to capture images of the impact and its aftermath. The LICIACube was launched alongside the DART spacecraft and is operated by the Italian Space Agency.\n\n## Effect of the impact on Dimorphos and Didymos\n\nThe DART spacecraft is designed to impact the smaller moon, Dimorphos, at a speed of around 6.6 kilometers per second (14,700 miles per hour). The impact is expected to cause a significant change in the moon's orbit around Didymos, with predictions suggesting a change in the orbital period of around 10 minutes.\n\n## Observations of the impact\n\nThe impact will be observed by a range of spacecraft and ground-based telescopes, including the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope. The observations will provide valuable insights into the effects of the impact and the resulting changes to the Dimorphos-Didymos system.\n\n## Follow-up mission\n\nA follow-up mission, known as the Hera mission, is planned to launch in 2024. The Hera mission will be operated by the European Space Agency and will focus on characterizing the effects of the DART impact on the Dimorphos-Didymos system.\n\n## AIDA mission architecture\n\nAlthough the AIDA mission was canceled, the original mission architecture provides a useful context for understanding the DART mission. The AIDA mission was designed to include two spacecraft: the DART spacecraft and a second spacecraft known as the AIM (Asteroid Impact Mission). The AIM spacecraft would have provided a detailed characterization of the target asteroid and its moon, while the DART spacecraft would have performed the kinetic impact.\n\n# Mission profile\n\n## Target asteroid\n\nThe target asteroid for the DART mission is Didymos, a near-Earth asteroid with a diameter of around 780 meters (2,560 feet). Didymos has a smaller moon, Dimorphos, with a diameter of around 160 meters (525 feet).\n\n## Preflight preparations\n\nPrior to launch, the DART spacecraft underwent a range of preflight preparations, including integration with the launch vehicle and testing of the spacecraft's systems.\n\n## Launch\n\nThe DART spacecraft was launched on November 24, 2021, aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California.\n\n## Transit\n\nFollowing launch, the DART spacecraft entered a heliocentric orbit, which took it on a trajectory towards the Didymos- Dimorphos system.\n\n## Course of the impact\n\nThe DART spacecraft is designed to impact the Dimorphos moon at a speed of around 6.6 kilometers per second (14,700 miles per hour). The impact is expected to occur in October 2022.\n\n### Sequence of operations for impact\n\nThe sequence of operations for the impact is as follows:\n\n1. Navigation: The DART spacecraft will use its navigation system to guide itself towards the Dimorphos moon.\n2. Terminal phase: The DART spacecraft will enter a terminal phase, during which it will make any final adjustments to its trajectory.\n3. Impact: The DART spacecraft will impact the Dimorphos moon at a speed of around 6.6 kilometers per second (14,700 miles per hour).\n\n# Gallery\n\n* Artist's impression of the DART spacecraft\n* Image of the Didymos- Dimorphos system taken by the Hubble Space Telescope\n* Diagram of the DART mission architecture\n* Image of the LICIACube spacecraft\n\n# See also\n\n* Asteroid Impact and Deflection Assessment (AIDA)\n* Hera mission\n* Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART)\n* Didymos\n* Dimorphos\n\n# Notes\n\n* The DART mission is a demonstration of a kinetic impactor technique for deflecting asteroids.\n* The mission is designed to test the feasibility of using a kinetic impactor to deflect an asteroid's trajectory.\n* The DART spacecraft is equipped with a range of instruments and systems, including a camera, solar arrays, antenna, and ion thruster.\n\n# References\n\n* None\n\n# External links\n\n* NASA DART mission website\n* Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory DART mission website\n* European Space Agency Hera mission website", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Double_Asteroid_Redirection_Test\" following this outline:\n\n#Mission history\n#Description\n##Spacecraft\n###Camera\n###Solar arrays\n###Antenna\n###Ion thruster\n##Secondary spacecraft\n##Effect of the impact on Dimorphos and Didymos\n##Observations of the impact\n##Follow-up mission\n##AIDA mission architecture\n#Mission profile\n##Target asteroid\n##Preflight preparations\n##Launch\n##Transit\n##Course of the impact\n###Sequence of operations for impact\n#Gallery\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The incident marked a significant loss for the Russian military and had far-reaching implications for the ongoing conflict.\n\n#Background\n\nThe Moskva was the flagship of the Russian Black Sea Fleet and one of the most advanced warships in the Russian Navy. Commissioned in 1983, the cruiser had a displacement of over 11,000 tons and was equipped with a range of armaments, including anti-ship missiles, torpedoes, and naval guns. The Moskva had previously participated in several military operations, including the Syrian Civil War and the annexation of Crimea in 2014.\n\nIn the lead-up to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Moskva had been deployed to the Black Sea, where it played a key role in supporting Russian naval operations. The cruiser was tasked with providing gunfire support to Russian ground troops, as well as enforcing a naval blockade of Ukrainian ports.\n\n#Sinking\n\n##Ukrainian account\n\nAccording to the Ukrainian military, the Moskva was struck by two R-360 Neptune anti-ship missiles fired from the coast of Odessa Oblast on the evening of April 13, 2022. The missiles allegedly hit the cruiser's ammunition magazine, causing a massive explosion and fire that engulfed the ship.\n\nUkrainian officials claimed that the Moskva had been operating in support of Russian ground troops in the vicinity of Snake Island, a strategic outpost in the Black Sea that had been captured by Russian forces earlier in the conflict. The Ukrainian military stated that the missile strike was carried out in response to Russian aggression and was intended to disrupt the enemy's naval operations.\n\n##Russian account\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense initially reported that the Moskva had suffered a fire on board, which had caused significant damage to the ship. However, the ministry did not acknowledge that the cruiser had been struck by Ukrainian missiles, instead attributing the blaze to an unspecified \"technical malfunction.\"\n\nIn the days following the incident, Russian officials gradually changed their narrative, eventually admitting that the Moskva had sunk in a storm while being towed to port for repairs. The Russian Ministry of Defense claimed that the crew had been safely evacuated, but did not provide any further information about the circumstances surrounding the sinking.\n\n##Other early observations\n\nEyewitness accounts from the scene suggested that the Moskva had indeed been struck by missiles, with several reports describing a large explosion and subsequent fire on board the ship. Video footage obtained by Ukrainian media outlets appeared to show the cruiser listing severely to one side, with smoke billowing from the vessel's superstructure.\n\n##Missile strike\n\nAnalysts believe that the Moskva was likely struck by Ukrainian Neptune missiles, which have a range of over 100 kilometers and are designed to engage surface targets at sea. The Neptune missile system is a Ukrainian-developed variant of the Soviet-era Kh-35 anti-ship missile, which has been modernized to include improved guidance and propulsion systems.\n\nThe use of Neptune missiles in the strike on the Moskva marked a significant escalation of Ukrainian military capabilities, demonstrating the country's ability to engage high-value targets at sea using domestic-developed armaments.\n\n##Images and video of the sinking ship\n\nIn the days following the sinking, several images and videos emerged showing the Moskva in its final moments. The footage, which was obtained from various sources, including Ukrainian drones and social media platforms, depicted the cruiser listing severely to one side, with smoke and flames engulfing the vessel.\n\nThe images and video of the sinking Moskva were widely shared on social media, sparking a mixture of shock, outrage, and celebration among observers. The incident marked a significant turning point in the conflict, highlighting the vulnerability of Russian naval forces and the growing capabilities of the Ukrainian military.\n\n#Casualties\n\nThe exact number of casualties resulting from the sinking of the Moskva remains unclear. Ukrainian officials claimed that the cruiser had a crew of over 500 sailors and officers, while Russian sources reported that the vessel had been carrying a significantly smaller complement.\n\nAccording to Russian reports, the entire crew of the Moskva was safely evacuated following the missile strike, with no fatalities or injuries reported. However, Ukrainian officials disputed this account, claiming that several dozen Russian sailors had been killed or wounded in the incident.\n\n#Impact\n\nThe sinking of the Moskva had significant implications for the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. The loss of the cruiser marked a major blow to Russian naval capabilities, highlighting the vulnerability of the country's warships to Ukrainian missile strikes.\n\nThe incident also marked a significant escalation of Ukrainian military capabilities, demonstrating the country's ability to engage high-value targets at sea using domestic-developed armaments. The use of Neptune missiles in the strike on the Moskva marked a significant turning point in the conflict, highlighting the growing capabilities of the Ukrainian military and the vulnerability of Russian naval forces.\n\n#Aftermath\n\nIn the aftermath of the sinking, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced that an investigation had been launched into the circumstances surrounding the incident. The ministry also reported that the crew of the Moskva had been decorated for their bravery, despite the loss of the cruiser.\n\nThe sinking of the Moskva also sparked a wider debate about the role of naval power in the conflict, with many analysts arguing that the incident marked a significant shift in the balance of power at sea. The loss of the cruiser highlighted the vulnerability of Russian naval forces and the growing capabilities of the Ukrainian military, marking a significant turning point in the conflict.\n\n#See also\n\n* Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* List of Russian naval vessels\n* Neptune missile system\n* Slava-class cruiser", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Sinking_of_the_Moskva\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Sinking\n##Ukrainian account\n##Russian account\n##Other early observations\n##Missile strike\n##Images and video of the sinking ship\n#Casualties\n#Impact\n#Aftermath\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

A dominant figure in American politics during the 1820s and 1830s, Jackson's presidency marked a significant shift in the country's politics, as he implemented a number of policies and reforms that had far-reaching consequences. A war hero, lawyer, and politician, Jackson's life was marked by controversy, adventure, and a strong sense of purpose.\n\n#Early life and education\n\nAndrew Jackson was born on March 15, 1767, in the Waxhaws region on the border of North and South Carolina. He was the third of three sons born to Andrew and Elizabeth Jackson, who had emigrated from Ireland in 1765. Jackson's early life was marked by hardship and tragedy, as his father died in 1767, before he was born, and his mother died in 1781, during the American Revolutionary War. Jackson and his brothers were raised by their relatives, with Jackson being educated at a local school and later attending a Presbyterian academy.\n\n#Revolutionary War\n\nIn 1780, at the age of 13, Jackson joined the Continental Army as a messenger and courier during the American Revolutionary War. He was captured by British soldiers in 1781 and held as a prisoner for several weeks. After his release, Jackson returned home and later moved to Tennessee, where he began to study law.\n\n#Early career\n\n##Legal career and marriage\n\nJackson began his law career in the late 1780s, practicing law in Jonesborough, Tennessee. In 1794, he married Rachel Donelson Robards, a wealthy widow who had fled her abusive husband. The couple had no children together, but raised several Native American children and two of their nieces.\n\n##Early public career\n\nJackson's entry into politics began in the late 1790s, when he was elected to the Tennessee state legislature. He later served as a U.S. Representative from Tennessee from 1796 to 1797 and as a U.S. Senator from Tennessee from 1797 to 1798. In 1801, he was appointed as a judge on the Tennessee Supreme Court, a position he held until 1804.\n\n##Planting career and slavery\n\nIn addition to his law and politics career, Jackson was also a successful planter. He owned a large plantation in Tennessee, known as the Hermitage, where he grew cotton and other crops. Jackson was also a slaveowner, owning over 150 slaves at the height of his career.\n\n##Duel with Dickinson and adventure with Burr\n\nIn 1806, Jackson engaged in a duel with Charles Dickinson, a wealthy planter who had insulted Jackson's wife. Jackson was shot in the chest during the duel, but managed to shoot and kill Dickinson. In 1807, Jackson became embroiled in a controversy surrounding Aaron Burr, the former Vice President of the United States, who had been accused of treason. Jackson supported Burr and helped to raise a militia to aid him, but ultimately did not participate in Burr's plans.\n\n#Military career\n\n##War of 1812\n\n###Creek War\n\nDuring the War of 1812, Jackson led a militia force against the Creek Nation, which had allied itself with the British. Jackson's forces were successful in several battles, including the Battle of Horseshoe Bend, where he defeated a large Creek force.\n\n###Battle of New Orleans\n\nIn 1815, Jackson led a force of militia and regular army troops against a large British force at the Battle of New Orleans. Despite being outnumbered, Jackson's forces were successful, and the British were forced to retreat.\n\n##First Seminole War\n\nIn 1817, Jackson was appointed as the commander of U.S. forces in the First Seminole War. He led a successful campaign against the Seminole tribe, which had been raiding U.S. settlements in Georgia and Alabama.\n\n#Presidential aspirations\n\n##Election of 1824\n\nIn 1824, Jackson ran for President, but lost to John Quincy Adams in a contentious election. Jackson's supporters claimed that Adams had stolen the election through a \"corrupt bargain\" with Henry Clay.\n\n##Election of 1828 and death of Rachel Jackson\n\nIn 1828, Jackson ran for President again and was successful, defeating Adams in a landslide election. However, his victory was marred by the death of his wife, Rachel, who died just days before his inauguration.\n\n#Presidency (1829–1837)\n\n##Inauguration\n\nJackson's inauguration was marked by controversy, as a large crowd of his supporters stormed the White House, causing damage and disrupting the proceedings.\n\n##Reforms and rotation in office\n\nJackson implemented a number of reforms during his presidency, including the rotation of government officials and the establishment of a new cabinet system. He also vetoed several bills, including a bill to re-charter the Second Bank of the United States.\n\n##Petticoat affair\n\nIn 1831, Jackson became embroiled in a controversy surrounding his Secretary of War, John Eaton, who had married a woman of questionable reputation. The controversy, known as the \"Petticoat affair,\" led to the resignation of several cabinet members.\n\n##Indian Removal Act\n\nIn 1830, Jackson signed the Indian Removal Act, which allowed the federal government to negotiate treaties with Native American tribes that would remove them from their lands to Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma). The act led to the forced relocation of thousands of Native Americans, including the Cherokee, Muscogee (Creek), Seminole, Chickasaw, and Choctaw.\n\n##Nullification crisis\n\nIn 1832, Jackson faced a nullification crisis, as South Carolina attempted to nullify a federal tariff. Jackson responded by issuing a proclamation that declared nullification to be unconstitutional, and he threatened to use military force to enforce federal law.\n\n##Bank War and Election of 1832\n\n###Bank veto\n\nIn 1832, Jackson vetoed a bill to re-charter the Second Bank of the United States, which he believed was unconstitutional and favored the wealthy.\n\n###Election of 1832\n\nIn 1832, Jackson ran for re-election and was successful, defeating Henry Clay and John Floyd.\n\n###Removal of deposits and censure\n\nIn 1833, Jackson ordered the removal of government deposits from the Second Bank of the United States, which led to a censure of Jackson by the Senate.\n\n###Panic of 1837\n\nIn 1837, a financial panic occurred, which was blamed on Jackson's policies. The panic led to a severe economic downturn that lasted for several years.\n\n##Physical assault and assassination attempt\n\nIn 1835, Jackson was the target of an assassination attempt by Richard Lawrence, a housepainter who was angry about the economy. Lawrence's pistols misfired, and Jackson was unharmed.\n\n##Slavery\n\nJackson was a slaveowner throughout his life, and his presidency was marked by controversy over the issue of slavery. He opposed the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia and vetoed a bill that would have prohibited the interstate slave trade.\n\n##Foreign affairs\n\nJackson's presidency was marked by several foreign policy crises, including a controversy over the annexation of Texas and a dispute with France over trade.\n\n##Judiciary\n\nJackson made several appointments to the Supreme Court, including the appointment of Roger Taney as Chief Justice.\n\n##States admitted to the Union\n\nDuring Jackson's presidency, two new states were admitted to the Union: Arkansas and Michigan.\n\n#Later life and death (1837–1845)\n\nAfter leaving office in 1837, Jackson retired to the Hermitage, where he died on June 8, 1845.\n\n#Personal life\n\n##Family\n\nJackson was married to Rachel Donelson Robards from 1794 until her death in 1828. He had no children with Rachel, but raised several Native American children and two of their nieces.\n\n##Temperament\n\nJackson was known for his strong personality and temper. He was a fierce fighter and was known for his dueling exploits.\n\n##Religious faith\n\nJackson was a Presbyterian and was raised in a devout household. He was known for his strong Christian faith throughout his life.\n\n#Legacy\n\nJackson's legacy is complex and multifaceted. He is remembered as a strong leader who expanded democracy and protected the rights of the common man. However, his presidency was also marked by controversy and violence, including the forced relocation of Native Americans and the veto of the re-charter of the Second Bank of the United States.\n\n#Writings\n\nJackson wrote several letters and speeches throughout his life, including his famous farewell address.\n\n#Notes\n\n#References\n\n#Bibliography\n\n##Biographies\n\n* Remini, Robert V.

This led to the formation of severe thunderstorms across the southern Plains, with numerous reports of large hail, damaging winds, and tornadoes.\n\n## April 6–7\n\nAs the low-pressure system continued to move eastward, it brought a cold front into the eastern United States, leading to the development of a new round of severe thunderstorms. The storms developed in a highly unstable atmosphere, with numerous reports of tornadoes, large hail, and damaging winds. The storms were particularly intense across the Southeast, where multiple long-lived tornadoes occurred.\n\n# Confirmed Tornadoes\n\n## April 4 Event\n\nA total of 5 tornadoes were confirmed on April 4, with the strongest being an EF2 tornado that occurred in Oklahoma. The tornado caused significant damage to homes and businesses, with multiple injuries reported.\n\n## April 5 Event\n\nA total of 23 tornadoes were confirmed on April 5, with the strongest being an EF3 tornado that occurred in Texas. The tornado caused significant damage to homes and businesses, with multiple fatalities reported.\n\n## April 6 Event\n\nA total of 35 tornadoes were confirmed on April 6, with the strongest being an EF4 tornado that occurred in Georgia. The tornado caused catastrophic damage to homes and businesses, with multiple fatalities reported.\n\n## April 7 Event\n\nA total of 25 tornadoes were confirmed on April 7, with the strongest being an EF2 tornado that occurred in North Carolina. The tornado caused significant damage to homes and businesses, with multiple injuries reported.\n\n## Pembroke–Ellabell–Black Creek, Georgia\n\nA devastating EF4 tornado occurred in Pembroke, Ellabell, and Black Creek, Georgia, on April 6.

It is a type of fur hat that is typically worn by men, particularly during the cold winter months. The malahai has a rich history, and its design and materials have evolved over time to reflect the changing needs and tastes of the Russian people.\n\n#Etymology\nThe word \"malahai\" is derived from the Russian word \"малахай,\" which is believed to have originated from the Turkic word \"malakai,\" meaning \"hat\" or \"cap.\" Over time, the term \"malahai\" has become synonymous with a specific type of fur hat that is unique to Russia.\n\n##Evolution of the term\nThe term \"malahai\" has undergone significant changes throughout its history. In the 16th century, the word referred to a type of woolen hat that was worn by men. However, as the centuries passed, the term began to be associated with a specific type of fur hat that was made from the fur of animals such as rabbits, squirrels, and foxes.\n\n#Design and materials\nThe design and materials used to make a malahai have evolved significantly over time. Traditionally, malahais were made from the fur of animals such as rabbits, squirrels, and foxes. The fur was typically harvested during the winter months, when it was thickest and warmest.\n\n##Types of fur\nThere are several types of fur that are commonly used to make malahais. These include:\n\n* Rabbit fur: This is one of the most common types of fur used to make malahais. Rabbit fur is soft, warm, and lightweight, making it an ideal choice for a hat.\n* Squirrel fur: Squirrel fur is another popular choice for malahais. It is slightly thicker than rabbit fur and has a distinctive texture that is prized for its warmth and durability.\n* Fox fur: Fox fur is one of the most luxurious types of fur used to make malahais. It is thick, warm, and has a distinctive sheen that is highly prized.\n\n##Construction\nMalahais are typically constructed using a combination of traditional and modern techniques. The fur is first harvested and then cleaned and processed to remove any dirt or debris. The fur is then cut and shaped to fit the desired shape of the hat.\n\n##Decorations\nMalahais are often decorated with a variety of embellishments, including ribbons, buttons, and other ornaments. These decorations serve to add a touch of elegance and sophistication to the hat.\n\n#In Russia\nThe malahai has played an important role in Russian culture for centuries. It has been worn by men of all social classes, from peasants to nobles.\n\n##Traditional wear\nTraditionally, malahais were worn by men during the cold winter months. They were an essential part of a man's wardrobe, providing warmth and protection from the elements.\n\n##Ceremonial wear\nMalahais have also played an important role in Russian ceremonial wear. They have been worn by men on special occasions, such as weddings and holidays.\n\n##Modern wear\nToday, malahais are still worn by men in Russia, although they are no longer as widely worn as they once were. However, they remain an important part of Russian cultural heritage, and many men continue to wear them as a symbol of national pride.\n\n#See also\n* Ushanka: A type of Russian fur hat that is similar to the malahai.\n* Papakha: A type of Russian fur hat that is worn by men in the Caucasus region.\n* Russian clothing: A general article about traditional Russian clothing.\n\n#Explanatory notes\nThis article is intended to provide a general overview of the malahai, a traditional Russian headdress.

Born on February 28, 1955, in Brooklyn, New York, Gottfried rose to fame in the 1980s with his raw, uncensored comedy style, which often pushed the boundaries of what was considered acceptable in mainstream entertainment.\n\n#Early life\n\nGilbert Gottfried was born to a Jewish family in the Coney Island neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. His father, Max Gottfried, was a hardware store owner, and his mother, Lillian (née Zimmerman), was a homemaker. Gottfried grew up in a middle-class family with his older sister, Arlene.

The republic was formed after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and its brief existence was marked by tensions with Ukraine and close relations with Russia.\n\n# Crimean ASSR\n\nThe Crimean Peninsula was part of the Russian Empire until the Russian Revolution in 1917. After the revolution, Crimea became part of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) and later part of the Soviet Union. In 1921, the Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (Crimean ASSR) was established within the RSFSR. The Crimean ASSR had a degree of autonomy, with its own government and laws, but was still subject to the authority of the Soviet government in Moscow.\n\nDuring World War II, Crimea was occupied by Nazi Germany, and the peninsula suffered significant damage and loss of life. After the war, the Crimean ASSR was re-established, and the region began to rebuild. In the 1950s and 1960s, the Soviet government invested heavily in the development of Crimea's infrastructure, including the construction of roads, bridges, and buildings.\n\n# Name change in 1992\n\nIn the early 1990s, the Soviet Union began to dissolve, and the Crimean ASSR declared its independence as the Republic of Crimea on May 5, 1992. The new state was recognized by Ukraine, but the Ukrainian government did not grant Crimea the status of a sovereign state. Instead, Ukraine recognized Crimea as an autonomous republic within Ukraine.\n\nThe name change from Crimean ASSR to Republic of Crimea was seen as a way to assert Crimea's independence and sovereignty. However, the move was also seen as a challenge to Ukraine's authority, and tensions between the two governments began to rise.\n\n# Relations with Ukraine\n\nThe relations between the Republic of Crimea and Ukraine were tense from the start. The Ukrainian government saw Crimea as a strategic region, with its access to the Black Sea and its military bases. Ukraine was also concerned about the potential for Crimea to become a rival state, with its own government and laws.\n\nIn 1992, Ukraine and Crimea signed a treaty that established the framework for their relations. The treaty recognized Crimea as an autonomous republic within Ukraine, but also granted Crimea a degree of autonomy and self-governance. However, the treaty did not address the issue of Crimea's sovereignty, and the two governments continued to disagree on the matter.\n\n# Relations with Russia\n\nThe Republic of Crimea had close relations with Russia, which had a significant influence on the region's politics and economy. Russia had a large military presence in Crimea, and the region was home to the Russian Black Sea Fleet. Russia also had significant economic interests in Crimea, including control of the region's energy resources.\n\nIn 1992, Russia and Crimea signed a treaty that established a framework for their relations. The treaty recognized Crimea as a sovereign state, but also established Russia as the guarantor of Crimea's security. The treaty was seen as a way to strengthen ties between Russia and Crimea, but it also raised concerns in Ukraine about Russia's intentions in the region.\n\n# Name change in 1995\n\nIn 1995, the Republic of Crimea was abolished, and the region was reintegrated into Ukraine as the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. The name change was seen as a way to resolve the tensions between Ukraine and Crimea, and to establish a more stable framework for their relations.\n\nThe decision to abolish the Republic of Crimea was made by the Ukrainian parliament, which voted to revoke the region's sovereignty and re-establish it as an autonomous republic within Ukraine. The move was seen as a way to assert Ukraine's authority over the region, and to prevent Crimea from becoming a rival state.\n\n# See also\n\n* Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic\n* Autonomous Republic of Crimea\n* Russian annexation of Crimea\n* Ukraine-Russia relations\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a brief overview of the history of the Republic of Crimea.

It involves the conversion of individuals and communities to Christianity, often through the efforts of missionaries, as well as the establishment of Christian institutions and practices. Christianization has played a significant role in shaping the history of many parts of the world, particularly in Europe, Africa, and the Americas.\n\nMissions\n--------\n\nChristianization often begins with missionary work, where individuals or groups travel to a new region to spread the teachings of Christianity. Missionaries may use various methods to convert people, including preaching, teaching, and providing aid and services. In some cases, missionaries may also establish schools, hospitals, and other institutions to support their work.\n\nIndividual Conversion\n--------------------\n\nIndividual conversion to Christianity typically involves several key steps, including baptism, Eucharist, and confirmation.\n\n### Baptism\n\nBaptism is the ritual by which an individual is initiated into the Christian faith. It typically involves the use of water, which is seen as a symbol of spiritual cleansing and rebirth. Baptism may be performed by immersion, sprinkling, or pouring, depending on the denomination and tradition.\n\n### Eucharist\n\nThe Eucharist, also known as Holy Communion, is the central sacrament of Christianity. It involves the consumption of bread and wine, which are seen as symbols of Christ's body and blood. The Eucharist is often celebrated in a liturgical setting, with prayers, hymns, and other rituals.\n\n### Confirmation\n\nConfirmation is the sacrament by which an individual is confirmed in their faith and receives the gift of the Holy Spirit. It typically involves the laying on of hands by a bishop or other authorized minister, as well as prayers and other rituals.\n\nPlaces and Practices\n--------------------\n\nChristianization often involves the transformation of existing places and practices to conform to Christian norms.\n\n### Temple Conversion within Roman Empire\n\nIn the Roman Empire, many temples and other pagan sites were converted into Christian churches and shrines.

This was often seen as a way to eradicate paganism and establish Christianity as the dominant faith.\n\n### Other Sacred Sites\n\nChristianization also involved the transformation of other sacred sites, such as springs, caves, and mountains.

The outbreak was first detected in the United Kingdom in May 2022 and has since spread to multiple countries and territories worldwide. As of [current date], the outbreak has resulted in [number] confirmed cases and [number] deaths globally.\n\n# Background\n\n## Emergency preparedness prior to outbreak\n\nPrior to the outbreak, the World Health Organization (WHO) and national health authorities had taken steps to prepare for potential public health emergencies, including the development of vaccines and diagnostic tests for monkeypox. However, the rapid spread of the virus caught many countries off guard, highlighting the need for enhanced global surveillance and preparedness measures.\n\n## Endemic mpox in Africa\n\nMonkeypox is endemic in parts of Central and West Africa, where it is typically spread through contact with infected animals or contaminated materials. In these regions, the virus has been a persistent public health concern, with periodic outbreaks occurring over the years. However, the 2022-2023 outbreak marked a significant departure from previous patterns, with widespread transmission reported outside of Africa.\n\n# Outbreak characteristics\n\n## Phylogenetics\n\nPhylogenetic analysis of the virus suggests that the 2022-2023 outbreak is caused by a distinct clade of the monkeypox virus, which is closely related to strains previously identified in West Africa. Further research is needed to determine the exact origin and evolutionary history of the outbreak strain.\n\n## Long incubation periods\n\nOne of the notable features of the 2022-2023 outbreak is the reported long incubation periods, with some cases exhibiting symptoms up to 21 days after exposure. This has complicated contact tracing efforts and highlights the need for sustained surveillance and monitoring.\n\n## Mild clinical manifestations\n\nMany cases reported during the outbreak have exhibited mild clinical manifestations, including skin lesions, fever, and headache. However, some cases have been more severe, with reports of hospitalization and death, particularly among individuals with underlying health conditions.\n\n## Fear of zoonotic spread\n\nThe detection of monkeypox in non-endemic countries has raised concerns about the potential for zoonotic transmission, where the virus is spread from animals to humans. While there is currently no evidence of widespread zoonotic transmission, the risk remains a concern, particularly in regions with high levels of animal trade and contact.\n\n# Chronology\n\n## Deaths outside of Africa\n\nThe first reported death outside of Africa occurred in [country] on [date]. Since then, [number] deaths have been reported in non-African countries, highlighting the need for enhanced surveillance and public health measures.\n\n# Transmission\n\n## Transmission patterns\n\nThe 2022-2023 outbreak has been characterized by multiple transmission patterns, including:\n\n* Human-to-human transmission through close contact, including sexual contact\n* Transmission through contaminated materials, such as bedding and clothing\n* Potential zoonotic transmission from animals to humans\n\n## Wastewater surveillance\n\nWastewater surveillance has played a critical role in detecting and tracking the spread of monkeypox. The presence of the virus in wastewater has been used to identify potential hotspots and inform public health interventions.\n\n# Interventions\n\n## Testing and containment\n\nTesting and containment measures have been implemented in multiple countries to slow the spread of the virus. These measures include contact tracing, isolation, and quarantine.\n\n## Vaccination\n\nVaccination efforts have been underway in multiple countries, using vaccines specifically designed to protect against monkeypox. While the effectiveness of these vaccines is still being evaluated, they have been shown to provide some level of protection against severe disease.\n\n# Social aspects\n\n## Misinformation\n\nThe 2022-2023 outbreak has been marked by widespread misinformation and disinformation, including conspiracy theories and false claims about the origins and spread of the virus. This has complicated public health efforts and highlighted the need for accurate and reliable information.\n\n# Responses\n\n## World Health Organization\n\nThe WHO has played a critical role in coordinating the global response to the outbreak, including providing technical assistance, guidance, and support to affected countries.\n\n## Countries\n\nMultiple countries have implemented public health measures to slow the spread of the virus, including enhanced surveillance, testing, and contact tracing.\n\n## Dependent territories\n\nDependent territories, including territories in the Americas and Pacific, have also reported cases and implemented public health measures to slow the spread of the virus.\n\n# Cases per country and territory\n\n## Timeline of first confirmed cases by country or territory\n\n* [Country/Territory]: [Date]\n* [Country/Territory]: [Date]\n* [Country/Territory]: [Date]\n\n## Timeline of suspected cases by country or territory\n\n* [Country/Territory]: [Date]\n* [Country/Territory]: [Date]\n* [Country/Territory]: [Date]\n\n## Timeline of first deaths by country or territory (in countries with initial 2022 detection from 6 May onwards)\n\n* [Country/Territory]: [Date]\n* [Country/Territory]: [Date]\n* [Country/Territory]: [Date]\n\n# See also\n\n* Monkeypox\n* Public health emergency\n* Global health security\n\n# External links\n\n* World Health Organization: Monkeypox\n* Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Monkeypox\n* European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control: Monkeypox", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022–2023_mpox_outbreak\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Emergency preparedness prior to outbreak\n##Endemic mpox in Africa\n#Outbreak characteristics\n##Phylogenetics\n##Long incubation periods\n##Mild clinical manifestations\n##Fear of zoonotic spread\n#Chronology\n##Deaths outside of Africa\n#Transmission\n##Transmission patterns\n##Wastewater surveillance\n#Interventions\n##Testing and containment\n##Vaccination\n#Social aspects\n##Misinformation\n#Responses\n##World Health Organization\n##Countries\n##Dependent territories\n#Cases per country and territory\n##Timeline of first confirmed cases by country or territory\n##Timeline of suspected cases by country or territory\n##Timeline of first deaths by country or territory (in countries with initial 2022 detection from 6 May onwards)\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
