The storm brought significant impacts to Mexico and the southwestern United States, particularly California. Hilary's strong winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surge caused widespread damage and disruption to communities along its path.\n\nMeteorological history\n-------------------\n\nHurricane Hilary formed on August 15, 2023, as a tropical depression about 200 miles southwest of the Mexican coast. The system strengthened rapidly, becoming a tropical storm just six hours later. Hilary continued to intensify, reaching hurricane strength on August 17. The storm's maximum sustained winds peaked at 145 mph (233 km/h) on August 18, making it a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.\n\nHilary's track took it northwestward, parallel to the Mexican coast, before making landfall in the state of Baja California Sur on August 20. The storm then moved northward, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall to the southwestern United States.\n\nPreparations\n------------\n\n### Mexico\n\nMexican authorities issued a hurricane warning for the Baja California Peninsula, with residents advised to evacuate coastal areas and seek shelter inland. The Mexican Navy and Army were deployed to assist with evacuations and relief efforts. Schools and businesses were closed, and flights were canceled at airports in the affected regions.\n\n### United States\n\nThe National Weather Service issued a tropical storm watch for parts of California and Arizona, with residents advised to prepare for strong winds and heavy rainfall. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) activated its emergency operations center to coordinate response efforts. California Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency, mobilizing the National Guard and state resources to support response and relief efforts.\n\nImpact\n------\n\n### Mexico\n\nHurricane Hilary made landfall in Baja California Sur, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall to the region. The storm caused widespread power outages, with over 100,000 households affected. Flooding was reported in several communities, with residents forced to evacuate their homes. The Mexican government reported two fatalities and over 100 injuries.\n\n### United States\n\n#### California\n\nHilary's strong winds and heavy rainfall caused significant impacts in California, particularly in the southern and central regions. The storm brought gusty winds, with speeds reaching up to 80 mph (129 km/h) in some areas. Heavy rainfall caused flash flooding, with several roads and highways closed due to flooding. The California Department of Transportation reported several rockslides and mudslides, with crews working to clear debris.\n\n#### Elsewhere\n\nArizona and Nevada also experienced strong winds and heavy rainfall from Hilary, although impacts were less severe than in California. The National Weather Service reported several tornadoes in Arizona, with no fatalities or injuries reported.\n\nAftermath\n----------\n\nThe aftermath of Hurricane Hilary saw widespread damage and disruption to communities along its path. Residents in Mexico and the United States were left to deal with the consequences of the storm, including power outages, flooding, and property damage.\n\nIn Mexico, the government declared a state of emergency, with resources mobilized to support response and relief efforts. The Mexican Navy and Army continued to assist with evacuations and relief efforts, with aid distributed to affected communities.\n\nIn the United States, FEMA coordinated response efforts, with resources deployed to support affected communities. The California Governor's Office of Emergency Services worked with local authorities to assess damage and provide aid to affected residents.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* List of Category 4 Pacific hurricanes\n* List of California hurricanes\n* 2023 Pacific hurricane season\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nThis article is a factual account of Hurricane Hilary's impact on Mexico and the United States.

The remarks, which were widely condemned by Muslims in India and around the world, led to widespread protests, violence, and diplomatic tensions between India and several Muslim-majority countries.\n\n#Background\n\nThe controversy began on May 26, 2022, during a televised debate on the Indian news channel Times Now, when Nupur Sharma, a spokesperson for the BJP, made comments about Muhammad that many Muslims found objectionable. Sharma's remarks were in response to a comment made by a Muslim panelist, who had criticized the Hindu deity Shiva. Sharma's comments were widely shared on social media, sparking outrage among Muslims in India and beyond.\n\n#Comments about Muhammad\n\nSharma's comments about Muhammad were widely reported in the Indian media, and were quickly condemned by Muslim leaders and organizations across the country. The comments were seen as a grave insult to the prophet, and many Muslims demanded that Sharma apologize and be punished for her remarks. The BJP eventually suspended Sharma from her position as spokesperson, but the damage had already been done.\n\nAnother BJP official, Naveen Jindal, also made comments about Muhammad that were widely criticized. Jindal, who was the head of the BJP's media cell in the state of Delhi, posted a tweet that was seen as derogatory towards the prophet. Jindal was expelled from the party after his tweet sparked outrage among Muslims.\n\n#Police cases\n\nSeveral police cases were filed against Sharma and Jindal in different parts of India, accusing them of promoting enmity between different groups and hurting religious sentiments. The cases were filed under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, including Section 295A, which deals with deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings.\n\n#Protests and violence\n\nThe comments made by Sharma and Jindal sparked widespread protests and violence across India, with many Muslims taking to the streets to demand action against the two BJP officials.\n\n##Uttar Pradesh\n\nIn the state of Uttar Pradesh, protests turned violent in several cities, including Kanpur and Prayagraj. In Kanpur, protesters clashed with police, resulting in injuries to several people. The state government imposed a curfew in several areas to maintain law and order.\n\n##Ranchi\n\nIn the city of Ranchi, which is the capital of the state of Jharkhand, protests turned violent, resulting in the death of two people. The state government imposed a curfew in the city to maintain law and order.\n\n##Howrah\n\nIn the city of Howrah, which is located in the state of West Bengal, protesters clashed with police, resulting in injuries to several people. The state government imposed a curfew in the city to maintain law and order.\n\n##Maharashtra\n\nIn the state of Maharashtra, protests were held in several cities, including Mumbai and Pune. The protests were largely peaceful, but there were reports of clashes between protesters and police in some areas.\n\n##Udaipur\n\nIn the city of Udaipur, which is located in the state of Rajasthan, a tailor was beheaded by two men who were angry about the comments made by Sharma. The incident sparked widespread outrage, and the state government imposed a curfew in the city to maintain law and order.\n\n##Kabul\n\nIn the Afghan capital of Kabul, protests were held outside the Indian embassy, with demonstrators condemning the comments made by Sharma and Jindal. The protests were largely peaceful, but there were reports of clashes between protesters and police.\n\n#International reactions\n\nThe controversy sparked widespread diplomatic tensions between India and several Muslim-majority countries.\n\n##Qatar\n\nThe government of Qatar summoned the Indian ambassador to express its condemnation of the comments made by Sharma and Jindal. The Qatari government also issued a statement calling for the Indian government to take action against the two BJP officials.\n\n##Other Arab states\n\nSeveral other Arab states, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Kuwait, also condemned the comments made by Sharma and Jindal. The governments of these countries issued statements calling for the Indian government to take action against the two BJP officials.\n\n##Other countries\n\nSeveral other countries, including Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Indonesia, also condemned the comments made by Sharma and Jindal. The governments of these countries issued statements calling for the Indian government to take action against the two BJP officials.\n\n##Organisation of Islamic Cooperation\n\nThe Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) also condemned the comments made by Sharma and Jindal. The OIC issued a statement calling for the Indian government to take action against the two BJP officials and to ensure the safety and security of Muslims in India.\n\n#Indian government response\n\nThe Indian government responded to the controversy by saying that it respected all religions and that the comments made by Sharma and Jindal did not reflect the views of the government. The government also said that it would take action against anyone who was found to have broken the law.\n\n#BJP response\n\nThe BJP responded to the controversy by saying that it had taken action against Sharma and Jindal, and that the party did not support their comments. The BJP also said that it respected all religions and that it would continue to work towards maintaining communal harmony in India.\n\n#See also\n\n* Islam in India\n* Hindu-Muslim relations in India\n* Bharatiya Janata Party\n* Indian general election, 2019\n* Indian politics", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Muhammad_remarks_controversy\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Comments about Muhammad\n#Police cases\n#Protests and violence\n##Uttar Pradesh\n##Ranchi\n##Howrah\n##Maharashtra\n##Udaipur\n##Kabul\n#International reactions\n##Qatar\n##Other Arab states\n##Other countries\n##Organisation of Islamic Cooperation\n#Indian government response\n#BJP response\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Founded in 1889, the club is one of the oldest and most successful in Indian football history. Mohun Bagan has a rich legacy, having won numerous domestic and international titles, and has produced some of the most iconic players in Indian football.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\n### Early years (1889–99)\n\nMohun Bagan was founded on August 15, 1889, by a group of Bengali football enthusiasts, including Bhupendra Nath Bose, Jitendra Nath Bose, and others. The club was initially known as the Mohun Bagan Football Club and was based in the Mohun Bagan Estate in Kolkata. During its early years, the club played friendly matches against other local teams and participated in regional tournaments.\n\n### Administrative and tactical overhaul under Subedar-major Sailen Basu (1900s)\n\nIn the early 1900s, Mohun Bagan underwent a significant transformation under the leadership of Subedar-major Sailen Basu. Basu, a military officer and sports enthusiast, was instrumental in modernizing the club's infrastructure, training methods, and playing style. He introduced new tactics and strategies, which helped the team improve its performance and compete at a higher level.\n\n### The historic year of 1911\n\n1911 was a watershed year for Mohun Bagan, as the club won its first major title, the IFA Shield. The team defeated East Yorkshire Regiment 2-1 in the final, marking a historic victory for Indian football. This achievement gained national attention and cemented Mohun Bagan's status as a force to be reckoned with in Indian football.\n\n### Nation-wide exposure of the club (1912–30)\n\nIn the following years, Mohun Bagan continued to gain national recognition, participating in tournaments and friendlies across the country.

The club's success in the NFL and other domestic competitions helped to establish it as a major force in Indian football.\n\n### Strive for success and ultimate takeover by KGSPL (2010–20)\n\nIn 2010, Mohun Bagan was taken over by the Kolkata Games and Sports Pvt. Ltd. (KGSPL), a sports management company.

The exercises were held in response to a visit by United States Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan, and were widely seen as a demonstration of China's military capabilities and its determination to assert its claims over the island.\n\n# Background\n\nThe background to the 2022 Chinese military exercises around Taiwan is complex and multifaceted. It involves a combination of historical, political, and military factors that have contributed to the escalating tensions between China and Taiwan.\n\n## Incursions into Taiwan ADIZ\n\nIn recent years, China has increased its military activities in the airspace around Taiwan, including incursions into the island's Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ). The ADIZ is a designated area where aircraft are required to identify themselves and state their intentions, and is used by Taiwan to monitor and respond to potential threats. China's incursions into the ADIZ have been seen as a way of testing Taiwan's defenses and asserting its claims over the island.\n\n## Escalation of tensions\n\nTensions between China and Taiwan have been escalating in recent years, driven by a range of factors including China's increasing military capabilities, Taiwan's efforts to assert its sovereignty, and the involvement of other countries in the region. The visit by Speaker Pelosi to Taiwan in August 2022 was seen as a significant escalation of tensions, as it was perceived by China as a challenge to its claims over the island.\n\n# Military Exercises\n\nThe 2022 Chinese military exercises around Taiwan were a series of large-scale drills that involved a range of military assets, including warships, submarines, fighter jets, and ballistic missiles. The exercises were held in several areas around Taiwan, including the Taiwan Strait, the East China Sea, and the South China Sea.\n\nThe exercises were widely seen as a demonstration of China's military capabilities and its determination to assert its claims over Taiwan. They involved a range of activities, including live-fire drills, amphibious landings, and missile launches. The exercises were also seen as a way of testing Taiwan's defenses and its ability to respond to a potential attack.\n\n# Reactions\n\nThe 2022 Chinese military exercises around Taiwan were widely condemned by other countries in the region and around the world. Many countries expressed concerns about the escalating tensions between China and Taiwan, and called for restraint and calm.\n\n## Japan\n\nJapan was one of the countries that expressed concerns about the 2022 Chinese military exercises around Taiwan. Japan's Prime Minister, Fumio Kishida, called for calm and restraint, and emphasized the importance of maintaining peace and stability in the region.\n\n## North Korea\n\nNorth Korea was one of the few countries that expressed support for China's actions. North Korea's state media praised China's military exercises, and emphasized the importance of defending national sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\n## Russia\n\nRussia also expressed support for China's actions. Russia's Foreign Ministry issued a statement calling for calm and restraint, but also emphasized the importance of respecting national sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\n## United States\n\nThe United States was one of the countries that condemned the 2022 Chinese military exercises around Taiwan. The US State Department issued a statement calling for calm and restraint, and emphasizing the importance of maintaining peace and stability in the region. The US also emphasized its commitment to Taiwan's security and its determination to defend the island against any potential attack.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe aftermath of the 2022 Chinese military exercises around Taiwan is still unfolding. The exercises have contributed to a significant escalation of tensions between China and Taiwan, and have raised concerns about the potential for conflict in the region.\n\nThe exercises have also highlighted the importance of diplomacy and dialogue in resolving disputes and maintaining peace and stability. Many countries have called for calm and restraint, and have emphasized the importance of finding a peaceful resolution to the tensions between China and Taiwan.\n\n# See Also\n\n* Cross-Strait relations\n* Taiwan Strait\n* Air Defense Identification Zone\n* People's Liberation Army\n* United States-Taiwan relations\n* China-Taiwan relations", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Chinese_military_exercises_around_Taiwan\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Incursions into Taiwan ADIZ\n##Escalation of tensions\n#Military exercises\n#Reactions\n##Japan\n##North Korea\n##Russia\n##United States\n#Aftermath\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The rise of this term reflects the growing recognition of the unique experiences and perspectives of individuals born during this period.\n\n#Birth date and age range\n\nThe exact birth date and age range of Zillennials are not rigidly defined, but they are generally considered to be individuals born between 1996 and 2001. This places them between the Millennial generation (born 1981-1995) and Generation Z (born 2002-2017). As of 2022, Zillennials are approximately 21-27 years old.\n\n#Characteristics\n\n##Arts and culture\n\nZillennials have grown up in a world where streaming services and social media have transformed the way people consume and engage with art and culture. They have been influenced by the rise of streaming platforms, which have made music, movies, and TV shows more accessible than ever before. As a result, Zillennials have developed a unique appreciation for diverse and niche content. They are also known for their love of nostalgia, often referencing and reinterpreting cultural icons from the 1990s and early 2000s.\n\n##Economic activity\n\nZillennials have entered the workforce during a time of significant economic uncertainty. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the job market, leading to widespread unemployment and economic instability. As a result, Zillennials have had to adapt to a rapidly changing economic landscape, with many opting for freelance or gig work. This has also led to a shift in their attitudes towards work and money, with many prioritizing flexibility and work-life balance over traditional notions of career success.\n\n##Health\n\nZillennials have grown up in a world where mental health awareness has become increasingly prominent. As a result, they are more likely to prioritize self-care and speak openly about their mental health struggles. However, they have also been exposed to the harsh realities of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has taken a significant toll on their physical and mental well-being. Zillennials are also more likely to engage in health-promoting behaviors, such as regular exercise and healthy eating, and are more open to alternative forms of healthcare, such as mindfulness and meditation.\n\n##Personal values\n\nZillennials place a high value on individuality and self-expression. They are more likely to prioritize personal freedom and autonomy, and are often drawn to careers and lifestyles that allow them to pursue their passions. They are also deeply committed to social justice and are more likely to engage in activism and advocacy on issues that matter to them. This has led to a growing recognition of the importance of diversity, equity, and inclusion in all areas of life.\n\n##Political activity\n\nZillennials have grown up in a time of significant social and political change. They have been shaped by the rise of social media, which has given them a platform to engage with politics and social issues in new and innovative ways. As a result, they are more likely to be involved in online activism and to use their voices to raise awareness about issues that matter to them. Zillennials are also more likely to identify as independents or members of third parties, reflecting their disillusionment with traditional politics.\n\n##Social life\n\nZillennials have grown up in a world where social media has transformed the way people connect and interact with one another. They are more likely to have large online social networks, but may struggle to form deep and meaningful relationships in real life. As a result, they are often drawn to experiences and activities that allow them to connect with others in a more authentic way, such as music festivals and group sports. Zillennials are also more likely to prioritize their relationships with family and close friends, and to value quality time over quantity.\n\n##Technology\n\nZillennials have grown up in a world where technology has been rapidly evolving. They are digital natives, and have been shaped by the rise of smartphones, social media, and streaming services. As a result, they are highly tech-savvy and are more likely to use technology to navigate all areas of their lives. Zillennials are also more likely to be concerned about issues related to technology, such as online safety and digital privacy, and are more likely to engage in online activism on these issues.\n\n#See also\n\n* Millennials\n* Generation Z\n* Generation X\n* Baby Boomers\n* Silent Generation\n* Microgeneration\n\n#References\n\n(Note: This section will be left blank as per the requirements)\n\n#Further reading\n\n(Note: This section will be left blank as per the requirements)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Zillennials\" following this outline:\n\n#Etymology\n#Birth date and age range\n#Characteristics\n##Arts and culture\n##Economic activity\n##Health\n##Personal values\n##Political activity\n##Social life\n##Technology\n#See also\n#References\n#Further reading\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The controversy sparked widespread protests, violence, and debates on social media, with many calling for the state government to intervene.\n\n#Background\n\nThe hijab, a traditional headscarf worn by many Muslim women, has been a part of the cultural and religious identity of Muslims in India for centuries. However, in recent years, there has been a growing debate about the hijab in educational institutions, with some arguing that it is a symbol of religiosity and others seeing it as a form of oppression.\n\nIn Karnataka, the hijab has been a contentious issue in educational institutions, particularly in colleges and universities. While some institutions have allowed female Muslim students to wear the hijab, others have prohibited it, citing concerns about uniformity and discipline.\n\n#Events\n\n##Udupi dispute\n\nThe controversy began in January 2022 at the Government Girls Pre-University College in Udupi, a coastal town in Karnataka. A group of six female Muslim students, all of whom wore the hijab, were denied entry into the college by the principal, citing a ban on wearing the hijab inside the campus.\n\nThe students, who had been wearing the hijab to college for several years, claimed that the principal's decision was arbitrary and discriminatory. They argued that the hijab was an essential part of their religious identity and that they should be allowed to wear it in college.\n\n##Saffron protests\n\nIn response to the hijab ban, a group of Hindu students, many of whom wore saffron scarves, protested outside the college, demanding that the hijab be banned permanently. The protests turned violent, with some Hindu students allegedly attacking Muslim students who were wearing the hijab.\n\nThe saffron protests were seen as a counter-movement to the hijab protests, with some Hindu groups arguing that the hijab was a symbol of Muslim separatism and that it should be banned in public institutions.\n\n##Government reaction\n\nThe Karnataka state government, led by Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, initially maintained that the hijab ban was a decision taken by the college authorities and that the government would not intervene.\n\nHowever, as the protests escalated, the government was forced to take a stance. The state education minister, B.C. Nagesh, announced that the government would set up a committee to look into the issue and provide a solution.\n\n##Fallout\n\nThe hijab controversy sparked a wave of protests and violence across Karnataka, with many schools and colleges being shut down due to the unrest. The controversy also led to a polarization of opinions, with many Hindus and Muslims taking to social media to express their views on the issue.\n\nThe controversy also led to a backlash against the Muslim community, with some Hindu groups accusing Muslims of trying to impose their religiosity on others.\n\n#Petitions in the High Court\n\n##Religious rights\n\nA group of Muslim students, including the six students who had been denied entry into the Udupi college, petitioned the Karnataka High Court, arguing that the hijab ban was a violation of their fundamental right to freedom of religion.\n\nThe petitioners argued that the hijab was an essential part of their religious identity and that they should be allowed to wear it in college. They also argued that the hijab ban was discriminatory and that it targeted Muslim students unfairly.\n\n##Government order\n\nThe Karnataka state government filed a counter-affidavit in the High Court, arguing that the hijab ban was a necessary measure to maintain discipline and uniformity in educational institutions.\n\nThe government argued that the hijab was not an essential part of Islam and that Muslim students could wear other forms of headscarves that were permissible under the college uniform.\n\n##College development committees\n\nThe High Court asked the government to constitute college development committees to look into the issue and provide a solution. The committees were tasked with consulting with students, teachers, and parents to find a solution that would satisfy all parties.\n\n##Udupi college and other institutions\n\nThe Udupi college, where the controversy began, was asked to constitute a committee to look into the issue. The committee, which consisted of teachers, students, and parents, recommended that the hijab be allowed in college, but with certain restrictions.\n\nOther institutions in Karnataka also constituted committees to look into the issue, with some allowing the hijab and others prohibiting it.\n\n#High Court verdict\n\nThe Karnataka High Court delivered its verdict on March 15, 2022, upholding the hijab ban in educational institutions. The court ruled that the hijab was not an essential part of Islam and that Muslim students could wear other forms of headscarves that were permissible under the college uniform.\n\nThe court also ruled that the hijab ban was a necessary measure to maintain discipline and uniformity in educational institutions.\n\n#Supreme Court\n\nThe verdict was challenged in the Supreme Court of India, which stayed the High Court's order and allowed Muslim students to wear the hijab in college until further orders.\n\nThe Supreme Court also issued a notice to the Karnataka state government, asking it to respond to the petition.\n\n#Violence\n\nThe hijab controversy sparked a wave of violence across Karnataka, with many schools and colleges being shut down due to the unrest. The violence led to a polarization of opinions, with many Hindus and Muslims taking to social media to express their views on the issue.\n\nThe violence also led to a backlash against the Muslim community, with some Hindu groups accusing Muslims of trying to impose their religiosity on others.\n\n#Reactions\n\n##Domestic\n\nThe hijab controversy sparked a wave of reactions across India, with many Hindus and Muslims taking to social media to express their views on the issue.\n\nMany Hindus argued that the hijab was a symbol of Muslim separatism and that it should be banned in public institutions. Many Muslims argued that the hijab was an essential part of their religious identity and that they should be allowed to wear it in college.\n\n##International\n\nThe hijab controversy also sparked international reactions, with many countries and organizations expressing concern about the issue.\n\nThe United States, the United Kingdom, and the European Union issued statements expressing concern about the hijab ban and the violence that followed.\n\n##Ministry of External Affairs (MEA)\n\nThe Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) of India issued a statement saying that the hijab controversy was an internal matter and that the government would not comment on it.\n\nThe MEA also said that the government was committed to protecting the rights of all citizens, including Muslim women.\n\n#Impact\n\nThe hijab controversy had a significant impact on the Muslim community in Karnataka, with many Muslim students facing discrimination and harassment in educational institutions.\n\nThe controversy also led to a polarization of opinions, with many Hindus and Muslims taking to social media to express their views on the issue.\n\nThe controversy also led to a backlash against the Muslim community, with some Hindu groups accusing Muslims of trying to impose their religiosity on others.\n\n#Rescission\n\nThe Karnataka state government rescinded the hijab ban in June 2022, following a directive from the Supreme Court.\n\nThe government also issued a circular allowing Muslim students to wear the hijab in college, subject to certain restrictions.\n\n#See also\n\n* Hijab\n* Islam in India\n* Education in India\n* Uniforms in India\n\n#Notes\n\n* This article is based on publicly available information and may not reflect the views of the author or the publisher.\n\n#References\n\n* None\n\n#Bibliography\n\n* None\n\n#External links\n\n* None", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Karnataka_hijab_row\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Events\n##Udupi dispute\n##Saffron protests\n##Government reaction\n##Fallout\n#Petitions in the High Court\n##Religious rights\n##Government order\n##College development committees\n##Udupi college and other institutions\n#High Court verdict\n#Supreme Court\n#Violence\n#Reactions\n##Domestic\n##International\n##Ministry of External Affairs (MEA)\n#Impact\n#Rescission\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This article explores the history, administration, and legacy of the County Palatine of Durham.\n\n# History\n\n## Early History\n\nThe County Palatine of Durham has its roots in the Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of Northumbria, which was divided into several smaller kingdoms and territories following the Viking invasions of the 9th century. The area that would eventually become the County Palatine of Durham was part of the Kingdom of Bernicia, which was ruled by the powerful Earls of Bamburgh. In 995, the Bishop of Durham, Aldhun, was granted the right to govern the territory by King Æthelred the Unready, marking the beginning of Durham's unique relationship with the English monarchy.\n\n## Establishment and Consolidation\n\nThe County Palatine of Durham was formally established in the 11th century, when the Bishop of Durham, William de St-Calais, was granted the right to govern the territory by King William II. The bishop was given the title of \"Prince-Bishop\" and was invested with the power to govern the county in the king's name. The County Palatine of Durham was unique in that it was not subject to the usual rules of English law and was instead governed by a special set of laws and customs known as the \"Durham Palatinate.\"\n\nOver the centuries, the County Palatine of Durham underwent a process of consolidation, with the bishop gradually acquiring more and more power and influence. In the 12th century, the bishop was granted the right to hold his own parliament, known as the \"Halmote,\" which met regularly to govern the county and settle disputes. The Halmote was a powerful institution that played a key role in the governance of Durham for centuries.\n\n## Decline and Abolition\n\nThe County Palatine of Durham began to decline in the 16th century, when the English monarchy began to assert its authority over the territory. In 1536, the Pilgrimage of Grace, a major rebellion against the English monarchy, was crushed in Durham, marking a turning point in the county's history. Over the next century, the power of the bishop and the Halmote was gradually eroded, and the County Palatine of Durham was eventually abolished in 1836, when the Durham County Palatine Act was passed.\n\n# Administration\n\n## Taxation\n\nThe County Palatine of Durham had its own unique system of taxation, which was based on the \"Durham Palatinate\" laws and customs. The bishop was responsible for collecting taxes, which were used to fund the government of the county and the bishop's own household. The main source of taxation was the \"grievance,\" a tax on land that was levied by the bishop. The grievance was a contentious issue, and there were frequent disputes between the bishop and the landowners of Durham over the amount of tax that should be paid.\n\n## Government and Courts\n\nThe County Palatine of Durham had its own system of government and courts, which were based on the \"Durham Palatinate\" laws and customs. The bishop was the supreme authority in the county, and he was advised by a council of senior clergy and laymen known as the \"Durham Council.\" The Durham Council met regularly to govern the county and settle disputes.\n\nThe County Palatine of Durham also had its own system of courts, which were responsible for administering justice in the county. The main court was the \"Halmote,\" which met regularly to hear cases and settle disputes. The Halmote was a powerful institution that played a key role in the governance of Durham for centuries.\n\n# St Cuthbert and the haliwerfolc\n\nThe County Palatine of Durham was closely associated with St Cuthbert, a 7th-century Northumbrian saint who was revered throughout the region. The bishop of Durham was the guardian of St Cuthbert's shrine, which was located in the cathedral at Durham. The shrine was a major pilgrimage site, and the bishop was responsible for protecting it and promoting the cult of St Cuthbert.\n\nThe County Palatine of Durham was also home to a unique group of people known as the \"haliwerfolc,\" who were the guardians of the saint's shrine and the bishop's household. The haliwerfolc were a powerful and influential group, and they played a key role in the governance of Durham for centuries.\n\n# Legacy\n\nThe County Palatine of Durham has left a lasting legacy in the north of England. The unique system of government and laws that developed in Durham has had a lasting impact on the region, and the county remains a distinct and separate entity to this day. The cathedral at Durham, which was built in the 11th century, is one of the most famous landmarks in the north of England, and it continues to attract visitors from all over the world.\n\nThe legacy of the County Palatine of Durham can also be seen in the many place names and customs that remain in the region. The county's unique history and culture have been preserved in the many museums and archives that are located in Durham, and the county remains a popular destination for tourists and historians alike.\n\n# References\n## Citations", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"County_Palatine_of_Durham\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Early history\n##Establishment and consolidation\n##Decline and abolition\n#Administration\n##Taxation\n##Government and courts\n#St Cuthbert and the haliwerfolc\n#Legacy\n#References\n##Citations\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The system was the second named storm of the 2021-22 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season.\n\n# Meteorological history\n\nCyclone Batsirai originated from a tropical disturbance that was first monitored by the Météo-France on January 24, 2022. The system was located in the central part of the South-West Indian Ocean, approximately 1,000 km (620 mi) north of Rodrigues Island. Over the next few days, the disturbance gradually developed, with convection increasing and banding features becoming more defined. On January 27, the system intensified into a tropical depression, and the Météo-France assigned it the name Batsirai.\n\nAs Batsirai continued to strengthen, it began to take on a more northwesterly track, driven by a subtropical ridge to the south. On January 29, the cyclone reached severe tropical storm intensity, with maximum sustained winds of 100 km/h (62 mph). Further intensification occurred over the next 24 hours, and Batsirai reached tropical cyclone intensity on January 30, with winds of 120 km/h (75 mph).\n\nBatsirai continued to intensify over the next few days, reaching peak intensity on February 2, with maximum sustained winds of 195 km/h (121 mph) and a minimum central pressure of 940 hPa (27.36 inHg). At this time, the cyclone was located approximately 500 km (310 mi) east of Mauritius. However, shortly after reaching peak intensity, Batsirai began to weaken due to increasing vertical wind shear and decreasing sea surface temperatures.\n\n# Preparations\n\n## Mauritius\n\nAs Cyclone Batsirai approached Mauritius, the island's authorities took various measures to prepare for the storm. On January 31, the Mauritius Meteorological Service issued a Class 3 cyclone warning, indicating that the storm was expected to bring strong winds and heavy rainfall. The warning was later upgraded to Class 4 on February 1, as the cyclone's intensity increased.\n\nThe government of Mauritius declared a state of emergency, and schools, universities, and government offices were closed. The Mauritius Ports Authority closed the Port Louis harbor, and all fishing activities were suspended. The Mauritius Electricity and Water Authority also took measures to prepare for potential power outages.\n\n## Madagascar\n\nIn Madagascar, the national meteorological agency, the Météorologie Nationale, issued a cyclone warning on January 31, as Batsirai was expected to make landfall on the eastern coast of the island. The agency warned of strong winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surges, and advised people to take necessary precautions.\n\nThe government of Madagascar also took measures to prepare for the storm, including evacuating people from low-lying areas and distributing emergency supplies. The National Office for Disaster Risk Management (BNGRC) was activated, and emergency response teams were deployed to affected areas.\n\n# Impact\n\n## Mauritius\n\nCyclone Batsirai made landfall on Mauritius on February 2, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall. The cyclone's eye passed directly over the island, causing widespread damage and disruption. The strongest winds were recorded at the Mauritius Meteorological Service's station at Le Morne, where gusts reached 234 km/h (145 mph).\n\nThe cyclone caused significant damage to buildings, roads, and infrastructure.

The theory posits that a secret cabal of powerful individuals, known as \"the elite,\" are working to undermine the United States government and institutions. QAnon adherents believe that a figure known as \"Q\" is a high-ranking government official who is working to expose this cabal and bring about justice.\n\nBackground\n\n### Pizzagate\n\nQAnon draws heavily from the Pizzagate conspiracy theory, which emerged in 2016. Pizzagate claimed that high-ranking officials in the Democratic Party were involved in a child sex trafficking ring operating out of a pizza parlor in Washington, D.C. Although the theory was thoroughly debunked, it laid the groundwork for the QAnon movement.\n\n### Influence of 4chan culture\n\nQAnon emerged from the culture of 4chan, an imageboard website known for its anonymous posting and lack of moderation. 4chan's /pol/ board, where QAnon originated, is a hub for far-right and conspiracy-oriented content. The board's culture of anonymous posting and lack of accountability allowed QAnon to spread quickly and take on a life of its own.\n\n### Previous \"anons\"\n\nQAnon is not the first conspiracy theory to emerge from 4chan. Previous \"anons\" have included theories about the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia and the \"true\" identity of the gunman in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.\n\nOrigin and spread\n\n### Mainstream attention\n\nQAnon gained mainstream attention in 2018, when adherents began appearing at Trump rallies and other public events. The movement's use of distinctive symbolism, such as the \"Q\" logo and \"Where We Go One We Go All\" (WWG1WGA) slogan, helped to identify its followers.\n\n### International following\n\nQAnon has attracted a significant international following, with adherents in countries such as the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia. The movement's online nature has allowed it to spread quickly across borders.\n\n### Pastel QAnon\n\nIn 2020, a variant of QAnon known as \"Pastel QAnon\" emerged. Pastel QAnon is characterized by its use of pastel-colored imagery and a focus on \"self-care\" and \"wellness.\" The variant is seen as a attempt to rebrand QAnon and make it more appealing to a wider audience.\n\nClaims\n\n### Q's posts\n\nQAnon is centered around the figure of \"Q,\" who posts cryptic messages on the internet forum 8chan (previously 4chan). Q's posts, known as \"Q drops,\" are often vague and open to interpretation. However, they are seen by adherents as containing hidden meaning and codes that, when decoded, reveal the truth about the cabal.\n\n### The cabal and \"the Storm\"\n\nQAnon adherents believe that the cabal is a powerful and secretive group of individuals who are working to undermine the United States government and institutions. The cabal is said to be responsible for a wide range of crimes, including child sex trafficking and murder. QAnon adherents believe that a figure known as \"Q\" is working to expose the cabal and bring about justice, a event known as \"the Storm.\"\n\n### Child sex trafficking and satanic sacrifice\n\nQAnon adherents believe that the cabal is involved in child sex trafficking and satanic sacrifice. This belief is based on a misinterpretation of a 2017 report by the National Human Trafficking Hotline, which found that the majority of reported human trafficking cases involved sex trafficking of minors.\n\n### Other QAnon beliefs\n\nQAnon adherents also believe in a wide range of other conspiracy theories, including the idea that the moon landing was faked and that 9/11 was an inside job.\n\nAnalysis\n\n### Identity of Q\n\nThe true identity of Q is unknown. However, many theories have been proposed, including the idea that Q is a high-ranking government official or a group of individuals working together.\n\n#### Multiple people\n\nSome researchers have suggested that Q is not a single individual, but rather a group of people working together to create the QAnon narrative.\n\n#### Paul Furber and the Watkins family\n\nIn 2020, a researcher named Fredrick Brennan identified a man named Paul Furber as a likely candidate for Q. Furber is a South African-born software developer who has been linked to the Watkins family, who own the 8chan forum where Q posts.\n\n### Slogans and vocabulary\n\nQAnon adherents use a distinctive set of slogans and vocabulary, including \"Where We Go One We Go All\" (WWG1WGA) and \"Trust the Plan.\" This language is seen as a way of identifying fellow adherents and signaling support for the QAnon narrative.\n\n### Derivative elements\n\nQAnon has incorporated elements from a wide range of conspiracy theories and ideologies, including Christianity and antisemitism.\n\n#### Christian themes\n\nQAnon has incorporated a number of Christian themes, including the idea of a coming apocalypse and the struggle between good and evil.\n\n#### Antisemitism\n\nQAnon has also been linked to antisemitism, with some adherents promoting conspiracy theories about Jewish people and the Rothschild family.\n\n### Appeal\n\nQAnon's appeal is complex and multifaceted. However, some researchers have suggested that the movement's use of symbolism and mythology has helped to attract followers.\n\n#### Disillusionment\n\nQAnon has also been linked to disillusionment with mainstream politics and institutions. Adherents often see the movement as a way of challenging the existing power structure and bringing about change.\n\n### Demographics\n\nQAnon's demographic makeup is not well understood. However, some researchers have suggested that the movement has attracted a disproportionate number of white, middle-aged men.\n\nIncidents\n\n### Attempts to overturn the 2020 U.S. election\n\nIn 2020, QAnon adherents were involved in attempts to overturn the results of the U.S. presidential election. This included a number of violent incidents, including the storming of the U.S. Capitol.\n\n### German coup attempt\n\nIn 2022, a group of QAnon adherents in Germany were arrested for allegedly plotting a coup. The group, which included a number of former military personnel, had planned to storm the German parliament and install a new government.\n\nReactions\n\n### Media, advocacy groups, and public figures\n\nQAnon has been widely criticized by media outlets, advocacy groups, and public figures. This has included accusations that the movement is promoting conspiracy theories and inciting violence.\n\n### Official responses\n\n#### FBI domestic terrorism assessment\n\nIn 2019, the FBI released a domestic terrorism assessment that identified QAnon as a potential threat. The assessment noted that QAnon's ideology was \"very likely\" to inspire violent acts.\n\n#### Congressional resolution\n\nIn 2020, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a resolution condemning QAnon and urging law enforcement agencies to take action against the movement.\n\n### Republican politicians and organizations\n\nSome Republican politicians and organizations have been linked to QAnon. This has included accusations that these individuals and groups are promoting conspiracy theories and inciting violence.\n\n### Connected individuals\n\n#### Donald Trump\n\nDonald Trump has been linked to QAnon, with some researchers suggesting that he has promoted the movement's ideology.\n\n#### Mike Pence\n\nMike Pence has also been linked to QAnon, with some researchers suggesting that he has promoted the movement's ideology.\n\n#### Michael Flynn\n\nMichael Flynn, a former U.S. National Security Adviser, has been linked to QAnon. Flynn has promoted the movement's ideology and has appeared at QAnon events.\n\n#### Lin Wood\n\nLin Wood, a lawyer and QAnon adherent, has been involved in a number of high-profile cases, including the defense of Kyle Rittenhouse.\n\n#### Sidney Powell\n\nSidney Powell, a lawyer and QAnon adherent, has been involved in a number of high-profile cases, including the defense of Michael Flynn.\n\n#### Kelly Townsend\n\nKelly Townsend, an Arizona state senator, has been linked to QAnon. Townsend has promoted the movement's ideology and has appeared at QAnon events.\n\n#### Liz Harris\n\nLiz Harris, an Arizona state representative, has been linked to QAnon. Harris has promoted the movement's ideology and has appeared at QAnon events.\n\nOnline\n\n### QDrops app\n\nThe QDrops app is a mobile app that allows users to access Q's posts and other QAnon-related content.\n\n### Anti-QAnon subreddits\n\nA number of subreddits have been created to counter QAnon, including r/qanoncasualties and r/AgainstQAnon.\n\n### Removal of content\n\nIn 2020, a number of social media platforms, including Twitter and Facebook, removed QAnon-related content from their sites.\n\n### Migration to alt-tech\n\nIn response to the removal of content from mainstream social media platforms, QAnon adherents have migrated to alternative platforms, such as Gab and Parler.\n\n### Return to Twitter/X\n\nIn 2022, QAnon adherents began to return to Twitter, which had previously banned the movement's content.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"QAnon\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Pizzagate\n##Influence of 4chan culture\n##Previous \"anons\"\n#Origin and spread\n##Mainstream attention\n##International following\n##Pastel QAnon\n#Claims\n##Q's posts\n##The cabal and \"the Storm\"\n##Child sex trafficking and satanic sacrifice\n##Other QAnon beliefs\n#Analysis\n##Identity of Q\n###Multiple people\n###Paul Furber and the Watkins family\n##Slogans and vocabulary\n##Derivative elements\n###Christian themes\n###Antisemitism\n##Appeal\n###Disillusionment\n##Demographics\n#Incidents\n##Attempts to overturn the 2020 U.S. election\n##German coup attempt\n#Reactions\n##Media, advocacy groups, and public figures\n##Official responses\n###FBI domestic terrorism assessment\n###Congressional resolution\n##Republican politicians and organizations\n##Connected individuals\n###Donald Trump\n###Mike Pence\n###Michael Flynn\n###Lin Wood\n###Sidney Powell\n###Kelly Townsend\n###Liz Harris\n#Online\n##QDrops app\n##Anti-QAnon subreddits\n##Removal of content\n##Migration to alt-tech\n##Return to Twitter/X\n#See also\n#Further reading\n#Notes\n#References\n##Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The election will determine the President of Turkey, as well as the 28th President of the Republic of Turkey, who will serve a five-year term.\n\n# Background\n\n## 2018 Elections\n\nThe 2018 Turkish presidential election was held on June 24, 2018, and resulted in the re-election of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan as President of Turkey. The election was the first to be held under the new presidential system, which was established by a constitutional referendum in 2017. The new system abolished the office of the Prime Minister and granted the President sweeping executive powers.\n\n# Date\n\n## Discussion on Snap Elections\n\nIn the months leading up to the election, there was speculation about the possibility of snap elections being called. However, in January 2023, President Erdoğan announced that the election would be held on May 14, 2023, as scheduled.\n\n## Discussion on Postponing Election Date\n\nIn February 2023, there were reports that the government was considering postponing the election date due to the aftermath of the 2023 Turkey-Syria earthquake. However, the idea was met with opposition from the opposition parties, and the election date remained unchanged.\n\n## Election Calendar\n\nThe election calendar was announced by the Supreme Election Council (YSK) in March 2023. The calendar set out the key dates for the election, including the start of the official campaign period, the deadline for candidate nominations, and the dates for the first and second rounds of the election.\n\n# Electoral System\n\nThe Turkish presidential election is held using a two-round system. In the first round, voters cast their ballots for one of the candidates. If no candidate receives more than 50% of the vote, a second round is held between the top two candidates. The candidate with the most votes in the second round is declared the winner.\n\n# Candidates\n\n## Candidates\n\nA total of four candidates are running in the election:\n\n* Recep Tayyip Erdoğan (Justice and Development Party)\n* Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu (Republican People's Party)\n* Sinan Oğan (Anatolia Alliance)\n* Muharrem İnce (Homeland Party)\n\n## Nominations\n\nThe deadline for candidate nominations was March 19, 2023. The nominations were submitted to the YSK, which verified the candidates' eligibility to run in the election.\n\n## Endorsements\n\nSeveral parties and alliances have endorsed candidates in the election:\n\n* The Nation Alliance, which includes the Republican People's Party, the Good Party, and the Future Party, has endorsed Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu.\n* The People's Alliance, which includes the Justice and Development Party and the Nationalist Movement Party, has endorsed Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.\n* The Labour and Freedom Alliance, which includes the Workers' Party of Turkey and the Greens and the Left Future Party, has endorsed Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu.\n\n# Second Round\n\n## Negotiations by Oğan and Özdağ\n\nIn the days following the first round of the election, there were reports of negotiations between Sinan Oğan and Ümit Özdağ, the leaders of the Anatolia Alliance and the Victory Party, respectively. The negotiations were aimed at reaching an agreement on which candidate to support in the second round.\n\n### Dissolution of ATA Alliance\n\nOn May 16, 2023, Sinan Oğan announced the dissolution of the Anatolia Alliance, which had been formed ahead of the election.\n\n### Endorsement of Erdoğan by Oğan\n\nOn May 17, 2023, Sinan Oğan announced that he would endorse Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in the second round of the election.\n\n### Özdağ's Support for Kılıçdaroğlu\n\nOn May 18, 2023, Ümit Özdağ announced that he would support Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu in the second round of the election.\n\n## Erdoğan's Strategy\n\nRecep Tayyip Erdoğan's strategy in the second round is focused on winning over voters who supported Sinan Oğan in the first round. Erdoğan has promised to implement policies that will benefit the country's rural areas, where Oğan's support was strongest.\n\n## Kılıçdaroğlu's Strategy\n\nKemal Kılıçdaroğlu's strategy in the second round is focused on winning over voters who are disillusioned with Erdoğan's rule. Kılıçdaroğlu has promised to implement policies that will benefit the country's youth and working class.\n\n## Potential Debate\n\nThere have been reports of a potential debate between Erdoğan and Kılıçdaroğlu ahead of the second round. However, the details of the debate have not been finalized.\n\n# Controversies\n\n## Erdoğan's Right to Seek Re-Election\n\nThere has been controversy over Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's right to seek re-election. Some have argued that the constitutional changes introduced in 2017, which allowed the President to serve two five-year terms, were designed to benefit Erdoğan specifically.\n\n## Political Violence\n\nThere have been reports of political violence in the run-up to the election. Several opposition party members have been attacked, and there have been allegations of intimidation and harassment.\n\n## Erdoğan's Photo on Ballot Paper\n\nThere has been controversy over the inclusion of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's photo on the ballot paper. Some have argued that this gives Erdoğan an unfair advantage.\n\n## Fake Videos\n\nThere have been reports of fake videos being circulated on social media, which appear to show opposition party members making inflammatory statements. The videos have been widely condemned as a form of disinformation.\n\n## Block of Ekşi Sözlük\n\nThe Ekşi Sözlük website, a popular online forum, was blocked by the government ahead of the election. The block was widely condemned as a form of censorship.\n\n## Reporting of the Results\n\nThere have been concerns about the reporting of the results, with some opposition parties expressing fears that the government may manipulate the outcome.\n\n## Azerbaijani and Russian Interference Allegations\n\nThere have been allegations of interference in the election by Azerbaijan and Russia. Some have accused the two countries of providing financial and logistical support to Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's campaign.\n\n# Opinion Polls\n\n## First Round\n\nOpinion polls ahead of the first round of the election showed Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu running neck and neck. Sinan Oğan and Muharrem İnce trailed behind.\n\n## Second Round\n\nOpinion polls ahead of the second round of the election show Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu running close. However, Erdoğan appears to have a slight lead.\n\n# Results\n\nThe results of the election will be announced by the Supreme Election Council (YSK) on May 28, 2023.\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe outcome of the election will have significant implications for Turkey's future. If Recep Tayyip Erdoğan wins, it is likely that he will continue to implement his policies, which have been widely criticized by opposition parties.

He is the second African American to serve on the Court, after Thurgood Marshall. Thomas has been a prominent figure in American politics and law, known for his conservative judicial philosophy and his role in many landmark Supreme Court cases.\n\nEarly life\n\nClarence Thomas was born on June 23, 1948, in Pin Point, Georgia, a small community near Savannah. He grew up in a poor Gullah Geechee community, where he spoke Gullah as his first language. Thomas's father abandoned the family when Thomas was two years old, and his mother remarried. However, Thomas's stepfather also abandoned the family, leaving Thomas's mother to care for him and his brother on her own.\n\nThomas was sent to live with his maternal grandparents in Savannah, where he attended St. Pius X High School. He later attended the College of the Holy Cross, where he graduated in 1971. Thomas then attended Yale Law School, where he earned his Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree in 1974.\n\nCollege of the Holy Cross and Yale Law School\n\nThomas's time at the College of the Holy Cross was marked by academic excellence and leadership. He was a member of the school's debate team and was elected president of the student body. Thomas has credited his time at Holy Cross with instilling in him the values of discipline and hard work.\n\nAt Yale Law School, Thomas was one of only 12 African American students in his class. He was a member of the Yale Law Journal and was active in the school's Black Law Students Association. Thomas has said that his time at Yale Law School was marked by feelings of isolation and frustration, as he struggled to find his place in the predominantly white institution.\n\nEarly legal career\n\nAfter graduating from Yale Law School, Thomas clerked for Judge John H. Pratt of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. He then worked as an assistant attorney general for the state of Missouri, where he was responsible for arguing cases before the Missouri Supreme Court.\n\nIn 1977, Thomas became a legislative assistant to Senator John Danforth of Missouri. He worked on a number of high-profile legislative initiatives, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n\nDistrict of Columbia Court of Appeals\n\nIn 1990, Thomas was nominated by President George H.W. Bush to serve on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. He was confirmed by the Senate in 1991, just months before he was nominated to the Supreme Court.\n\nNomination to the Supreme Court\n\nThomas was nominated to the Supreme Court by President George H.W. Bush on July 1, 1991, to replace retiring Justice Thurgood Marshall. The nomination was seen as a surprise, as Thomas was relatively unknown at the time.\n\nAnita Hill accusations\n\nDuring Thomas's confirmation hearings, Anita Hill, a former colleague of Thomas's at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), came forward with allegations of sexual harassment. Hill testified that Thomas had made unwanted advances and comments during their time working together.\n\nSecond hearing\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee held a second hearing to investigate Hill's allegations. Thomas denied the allegations, calling them \"a high-tech lynching.\" The hearing was widely covered in the media and sparked a national debate about sexual harassment and racism.\n\nSenate votes\n\nThe Senate voted 52-48 to confirm Thomas to the Supreme Court on October 15, 1991. Thomas was sworn in as an Associate Justice on October 23, 1991.\n\nSupreme Court of the United States\n\nThomas has been a member of the Supreme Court for over 30 years, during which time he has developed a reputation as a conservative jurist. He has been a key player in many landmark cases, including decisions on abortion, gun control, and affirmative action.\n\nGovernment powers and legal structure\n\nThomas has been a strong advocate for limited government and individual rights. He has argued that the Constitution sets out clear limits on the power of the federal government and that the Court should be hesitant to expand those powers.\n\nCourt precedent\n\nThomas has been critical of the Court's use of precedent, arguing that it can be used to justify judicial activism. He has advocated for a more originalist approach to interpreting the Constitution, one that looks to the original meaning of the text rather than later interpretations.\n\nExecutive power\n\nThomas has been a strong supporter of executive power, arguing that the President has broad authority to act in the national interest. He has defended the President's power to appoint officials and to conduct foreign policy, even in the face of opposition from Congress.\n\nFederalism and states' rights\n\nThomas has been a strong advocate for federalism and states' rights. He has argued that the Constitution sets out clear limits on the power of the federal government and that states should be free to experiment with different policies and approaches.\n\nIndividual rights\n\nThomas has been a strong supporter of individual rights, including the right to bear arms and the right to free speech. He has argued that these rights are essential to a free and functioning society.\n\nFirst Amendment\n\nThomas has been a strong supporter of the First Amendment, which protects the right to free speech and the freedom of the press. He has argued that the First Amendment sets out clear limits on the power of the government to regulate speech and that the Court should be hesitant to expand those limits.\n\nSecond Amendment\n\nThomas has been a strong supporter of the Second Amendment, which protects the right to bear arms. He has argued that the Second Amendment sets out a clear right to individual self-defense and that the Court should be hesitant to limit that right.\n\nFourth Amendment\n\nThomas has been critical of the Court's interpretation of the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. He has argued that the Court has been too willing to allow warrantless searches and seizures and that the Fourth Amendment sets out clear limits on the power of the government to conduct searches.\n\nSixth Amendment\n\nThomas has been a strong supporter of the Sixth Amendment, which protects the right to a fair trial. He has argued that the Sixth Amendment sets out clear limits on the power of the government to regulate trials and that the Court should be hesitant to expand those limits.\n\nEighth Amendment\n\nThomas has been critical of the Court's interpretation of the Eighth Amendment, which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment. He has argued that the Court has been too willing to allow the use of capital punishment and that the Eighth Amendment sets out clear limits on the power of the government to punish.\n\nFourteenth Amendment\n\nThomas has been a strong supporter of the Fourteenth Amendment, which protects the right to equal protection under the law. He has argued that the Fourteenth Amendment sets out clear limits on the power of the government to discriminate and that the Court should be hesitant to expand those limits.\n\nAbortion and family planning\n\nThomas has been a strong opponent of abortion and has argued that the Constitution does not protect a right to abortion. He has voted to uphold restrictions on abortion and has argued that the Court should be hesitant to strike down laws that regulate abortion.\n\nLGBTQ rights\n\nThomas has been a strong opponent of LGBTQ rights and has argued that the Constitution does not protect a right to same-sex marriage. He has voted to uphold restrictions on LGBTQ rights and has argued that the Court should be hesitant to strike down laws that regulate LGBTQ rights.\n\nOral arguments\n\nThomas has been known for his relatively quiet approach to oral arguments, often asking few questions and allowing other justices to take the lead. However, he has been a strong advocate for his own views and has not hesitated to speak out when he disagrees with other justices.\n\nPersonal life\n\nThomas has been married to his wife, Ginni, since 1987. The couple has one son, Jamal, who was born in 1973. Thomas has been a strong advocate for his family and has prioritized his family life throughout his career.\n\nFamily\n\nThomas has spoken publicly about the importance of his family and has credited his wife and son with supporting him throughout his career. He has also spoken about the challenges of balancing work and family life, particularly in the early years of his career.\n\nReligion\n\nThomas is a Catholic and has spoken publicly about the importance of his faith. He has credited his faith with instilling in him the values of discipline and hard work.\n\nLiterary influences\n\nThomas has spoken publicly about the influence of literary figures such as Frederick Douglass and Booker T. Washington on his life and work. He has credited these figures with shaping his views on education and self-reliance.\n\nMoira Smith allegations\n\nIn 2020, Moira Smith, a former employee of Thomas's, came forward with allegations of misconduct. Smith alleged that Thomas had made unwanted advances and comments during her time working for him. Thomas denied the allegations, calling them \"unsubstantiated\" and \"untrue.\"\n\nNondisclosure of finances\n\nThomas has been criticized for not disclosing his finances, particularly in the early years of his career. He has argued that he was not required to disclose his finances and that the criticism is unfair.\n\nHonors and recognition\n\nThomas has received a number of honors and awards throughout his career, including the National Bar Association's highest award for public service.\n\nIn popular culture\n\nThomas has been portrayed in a number of films and television shows, including the 2016 film \"Confirmation\" and the 2019 television series \"The Oval.\"\n\nWritings\n\nThomas has written a number of books and articles throughout his career, including a memoir and a collection of essays on the Constitution.\n\nSee also\n\n* List of African American jurists\n* List of justices of the Supreme Court of the United States\n* List of law clerks of the Supreme Court of the United States\n\nFootnotes\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\n* \"My Grandfather's Son: A Memoir\" by Clarence Thomas\n* \"The Supreme Court\" by Jeffrey Toobin\n* \"The Thomas Hearing\" by Timothy M.

This was the 43rd edition of the championship, which was originally scheduled to take place in 2021 but was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n#Qualification\n\n##Russian participation\n\nIn February 2022, the World Curling Federation (WCF) announced that Russia would not be allowed to participate in the championship due to the country's invasion of Ukraine. The Russian Curling Federation was suspended, and the team was withdrawn from the competition.\n\n##COVID-19 issues\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the championship, with several teams facing challenges related to travel and quarantine restrictions.\n\n###Scotland\n\nThe Scottish team was forced to withdraw from the competition due to COVID-19 issues. The team's skip, Eve Muirhead, tested positive for the virus, and several other team members were deemed close contacts.\n\n###Japan\n\nThe Japanese team also faced COVID-19 issues, with several team members testing positive for the virus. Despite this, the team was able to participate in the championship, albeit with some adjustments to their lineup.\n\n#Teams\n\nA total of 13 teams participated in the championship, representing their respective countries and curling associations. The teams were:\n\n*  Canada (represented by the Kerri Einarson rink)\n*  China (represented by the Han Yu rink)\n*  Czech Republic (represented by the Alžběta Baudyšová rink)\n*  Denmark (represented by the Madeleine Dupont rink)\n*  Germany (represented by the Daniela Jentsch rink)\n*  Italy (represented by the Stefania Constantini rink)\n*  Japan (represented by the Satsuki Fujisawa rink)\n*  South Korea (represented by the Kim Eun-jung rink)\n*  Norway (represented by the Marianne Rørvik rink)\n*  Sweden (represented by the Anna Hasselborg rink)\n*  Switzerland (represented by the Alina Pätz rink)\n*  Turkey (represented by the Dilşat Yıldız rink)\n*  United States (represented by the Tabitha Peterson rink)\n\n##WCF ranking\n\nThe teams were ranked according to their performance in the 2020-21 World Curling Tour season, with the top-ranked teams receiving a bye to the playoffs.\n\n#Rule changes\n\nThe WCF introduced several rule changes for the 2022 championship, including the use of a \"power play\" in the playoffs. The power play allowed teams to choose which end of the ice they would throw from, rather than following the traditional alternating pattern.\n\n#Round-robin standings\n\nThe round-robin stage of the championship consisted of 18 draws, with each team playing every other team once. The top four teams in the standings qualified for the playoffs.\n\n| Rank | Team | W | L |\n| 1 |  Canada | 12 | 0 |\n| 2 |  Sweden | 9 | 3 |\n| 3 |  South Korea | 8 | 4 |\n| 4 |  Switzerland | 8 | 4 |\n| 5 |  United States | 7 | 5 |\n| 6 |  Japan | 6 | 6 |\n| 7 |  China | 5 | 7 |\n| 8 |  Germany | 5 | 7 |\n| 9 |  Italy | 4 | 8 |\n| 10 |  Czech Republic | 3 | 9 |\n| 11 |  Denmark | 2 | 10 |\n| 12 |  Norway | 2 | 10 |\n| 13 |  Turkey | 1 | 11 |\n\n#Round-robin results\n\n##Draw 1\n\n*  Canada 9,  Czech Republic 2\n*  Sweden 8,  Germany 4\n*  South Korea 7,  Italy 5\n*  Switzerland 6,  United States 5\n*  Japan 8,  China 3\n*  Denmark 7,  Norway 6\n*  Turkey 5,  Turkey 4\n\n##Draw 2\n\n*  Canada 10,  Norway 2\n*  Sweden 9,  Turkey 3\n*  South Korea 8,  Denmark 5\n*  Switzerland 7,  Japan 4\n*  United States 9,  Czech Republic 2\n*  Germany 8,  Italy 5\n*  China 7,  Switzerland 4\n\n##Draw 3\n\n*  Canada 9,  Denmark 3\n*  Sweden 8,  South Korea 5\n*  Switzerland 7,  Czech Republic 3\n*  United States 9,  Norway 2\n*  Japan 8,  Germany 4\n*  China 7,  Italy 5\n*  Turkey 6,  Turkey 5\n\n##Draw 4\n\n*  Canada 10,  Italy 4\n*  Sweden 9,  China 5\n*  South Korea 8,  Turkey 2\n*  Switzerland 7,  Norway 3\n*  United States 9,  Denmark 5\n*  Japan 8,  Czech Republic 5\n*  Germany 7,  Switzerland 4\n\n##Draw 5\n\n*  Canada 9,  Turkey 2\n*  Sweden 10,  Norway 3\n*  South Korea 8,  Germany 5\n*  Switzerland 7,  Denmark 4\n*  United States 9,  China 5\n*  Japan 8,  Italy 6\n*  Czech Republic 7,  Turkey 4\n\n##Draw 6\n\n*  Canada 10,  Germany 4\n*  Sweden 9,  Switzerland 6\n*  South Korea 8,  China 5\n*  United States 9,  Italy 5\n*  Japan 8,  Turkey 5\n*  Denmark 7,  Czech Republic 6\n*  Norway 6,  Turkey 5\n\n##Draw 7\n\n*  Canada 9,  China 4\n*  Sweden 10,  Denmark 2\n*  South Korea 8,  Norway 5\n*  Switzerland 7,  Italy 4\n*  United States 9,  Turkey 3\n*  Japan 8,  Germany 6\n*  Czech Republic 7,  Switzerland 5\n\n##Draw 8\n\n*  Canada 10,  Switzerland 3\n*  Sweden 9,  Japan 5\n*  South Korea 8,  United States 6\n*  Germany 7,  Denmark 4\n*  China 7,  Czech Republic 5\n*  Italy 8,  Turkey 5\n*  Norway 6,  Turkey 5\n\n##Draw 9\n\n*  Canada 9,  United States 4\n*  Sweden 10,  Czech Republic 3\n*  South Korea 8,  Switzerland 6\n*  Japan 8,  Norway 5\n*  Germany 7,  Turkey 4\n*  China 7,  Denmark 5\n*  Italy 8,  Switzerland 6\n\n##Draw 10\n\n*  Canada 10,  Japan 4\n*  Sweden 9,  Germany 5\n*  South Korea 8,  Czech Republic 5\n*  United States 9,  Italy 5\n*  Switzerland 7,  Turkey 4\n*  China 7,  Norway 6\n*  Denmark 7,  Turkey 5\n\n##Draw 11\n\n*  Canada 9,  Norway 3\n*  Sweden 10,  Turkey 2\n*  South Korea 8,  Denmark 5\n*  Switzerland 7,  Japan 4\n*  United States 9,  Czech Republic 2\n*  Germany 8,  Italy 5\n*  China 7,  Switzerland 4\n\n##Draw 12\n\n*  Canada 10,  Denmark 3\n*  Sweden 9,  South Korea 5\n*  Switzerland 7,  Czech Republic 3\n*  United States 9,  Norway 2\n*  Japan 8,  Germany 4\n*  China 7,  Italy 5\n*  Turkey 6,  Turkey 5\n\n##Draw 13\n\n*  Canada 10,  Italy 4\n*  Sweden 9,  China 5\n*  South Korea 8,  Turkey 2\n*  Switzerland 7,  Norway 3\n*  United States 9,  Denmark 5\n*  Japan 8,  Czech Republic 5\n*  Germany 7,  Switzerland 4\n\n##Draw 14\n\n*  Canada 9,  Turkey 2\n*  Sweden 10,  Norway 3\n*  South Korea 8,  Germany 5\n*  Switzerland 7,  Denmark 4\n*  United States 9,  China 5\n*  Japan 8,  Italy 6\n*  Czech Republic 7,  Turkey 4\n\n##Draw 15\n\n*  Canada 10,  Germany 4\n*  Sweden 9,  Switzerland 6\n*  South Korea 8,  China 5\n*  United States 9,  Italy 5\n*  Japan 8,  Turkey 5\n*  Denmark 7,  Czech Republic 6\n*  Norway 6,  Turkey 5\n\n##Draw 16\n\n*  Canada 9,  China 4\n*  Sweden 10,  Denmark 2\n*  South Korea 8,  Norway 5\n*  Switzerland 7,  Italy 4\n*  United States 9,  Turkey 3\n*  Japan 8,  Germany 6\n*  Czech Republic 7,  Switzerland 5\n\n##Draw 17\n\n*  Canada 10,  Switzerland 3\n*  Sweden 9,  Japan 5\n*  South Korea 8,  United States 6\n*  Germany 7,  Denmark 4\n*  China 7,  Czech Republic 5\n*  Italy 8,  Turkey 5\n*  Norway 6,  Turkey 5\n\n##Draw 18\n\n*  Canada 9,  United States 4\n*  Sweden 10,  Czech Republic 3\n*  South Korea 8,  Switzerland 6\n*  Japan 8,  Norway 5\n*  Germany 7,  Turkey 4\n*  China 7,  Denmark 5\n*  Italy 8,  Switzerland 6\n\n#Playoffs\n\n##Qualification games\n\n*  Switzerland 8,  United States 5\n*  South Korea 8,  Japan 6\n\n##Semifinals\n\n*  Canada 9,  Switzerland 4\n*  Sweden 8,  South Korea 6\n\n##Bronze-medal game\n\n*  South Korea 8,  Switzerland 6\n\n##Final\n\n*  Canada 9,  Sweden 7\n\n#Statistics\n\n##Top 5 player percentages\n\n| Rank | Player | Team | Percentage |\n| 1 | Alina Pätz |  Switzerland | 90.4% |\n| 2 | Tabitha Peterson |  United States | 88.3% |\n| 3 | Eve Muirhead |  Scotland | 87.9% |\n| 4 | Anna Hasselborg |  Sweden | 87.5% |\n| 5 | Kerri Einarson |  Canada | 87.3% |\n\n##Perfect games\n\n*  Alina Pätz (Switzerland) -

Her father was a Welsh-born professor of German and her mother was born in the UK but raised in Australia. Newton-John has an older brother, Hugh, and an older sister, Rona.

At 14, she formed a girl group called The Sol Four, which performed at local coffee shops and shopping centers.

The storm, which was fueled by a low-pressure system that developed in the Rocky Mountains, caused widespread disruptions to transportation, daily life, and the economy.\n\n# Meteorological history\n\nThe December 2022 North American winter storm began to take shape on December 20, 2022, as a low-pressure system developed in the Rocky Mountains. The system quickly intensified, fueled by a strong cold front that had pushed south from Canada. As the low-pressure system moved east, it began to tap into a large mass of cold air that had been building over the northern United States. This led to a rapid intensification of the storm, with snowfall rates reaching up to 2 inches per hour in some areas.\n\nThe storm system moved rapidly east, bringing heavy snowfall and strong winds to a large swath of the United States and Canada. The storm's impact was felt from the Rocky Mountains to the East Coast, with significant snowfall reported in over 20 states and several Canadian provinces. The storm's strongest winds were reported in the Midwest and Northeast, where gusts reached up to 60 mph in some areas.\n\n# Preparations\n\nIn the days leading up to the storm, meteorologists and emergency management officials issued numerous warnings and advisories to the public. The National Weather Service (NWS) issued a Winter Storm Watch for many areas, while the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) activated its emergency operations center to coordinate the response to the storm.\n\nMany states and local governments took steps to prepare for the storm, including declaring states of emergency, activating emergency response teams, and stockpiling supplies. The American Red Cross also activated its disaster response teams, deploying personnel and resources to affected areas.\n\n# Impact\n\nThe December 2022 North American winter storm had a significant impact on many areas, causing widespread disruptions to transportation, daily life, and the economy.\n\n## Deaths\n\nThe storm was responsible for at least 100 deaths, primarily due to hypothermia, heart attacks, and traffic accidents. Many of the deaths were reported in areas where the storm's impact was most severe, including the Midwest and Northeast.\n\n## Infrastructure\n\nThe storm had a significant impact on infrastructure, including transportation systems, utilities, and buildings.\n\n### Flight delays and cancellations\n\nThe storm caused widespread disruptions to air travel, with over 10,000 flights delayed or cancelled. Many major airports, including those in Chicago, New York City, and Boston, were forced to close due to the storm.\n\n### Road closures and crashes\n\nThe storm caused numerous road closures and crashes, particularly in areas where the snowfall was heaviest. Many major highways, including those in the Midwest and Northeast, were forced to close due to the storm.\n\n### Intra-city transit disruptions\n\nThe storm also caused disruptions to intra-city transit systems, including buses and subways. Many cities, including New York City and Chicago, were forced to suspend service due to the storm.\n\n### Inter-city train delays and cancellations\n\nThe storm caused delays and cancellations to inter-city train service, including Amtrak. Many routes, particularly those in the Northeast, were forced to close due to the storm.\n\n### Energy emergencies\n\nThe storm caused energy emergencies in many areas, particularly in the Midwest and Northeast. Many utilities, including those in Michigan and New York, were forced to declare energy emergencies due to the storm.\n\n### Power outages\n\nThe storm caused widespread power outages, particularly in areas where the snowfall was heaviest. Over 1 million households were left without power at the peak of the storm.\n\n## Sports\n\nThe storm caused disruptions to many sports events, including football and basketball games. Many games, particularly those in the Midwest and Northeast, were forced to be postponed or cancelled due to the storm.\n\n## Corporate and institutional closures\n\nThe storm caused many corporations and institutions to close, particularly in areas where the storm's impact was most severe. Many major companies, including those in the financial and retail sectors, were forced to close due to the storm.\n\n## Animals\n\nThe storm had a significant impact on animals, particularly those in outdoor shelters. Many animal shelters, particularly those in the Midwest and Northeast, were forced to close due to the storm.\n\n# Post-storm cold wave\n\nFollowing the storm, a severe cold wave swept across the United States and Canada, bringing temperatures down to record lows in many areas.\n\n## Rocky Mountain region\n\nThe cold wave had a significant impact on the Rocky Mountain region, where temperatures dropped to as low as -20°F in some areas.\n\n## Central United States\n\nThe cold wave also had a significant impact on the central United States, where temperatures dropped to as low as -10°F in some areas.\n\n## Eastern United States\n\nThe cold wave had a significant impact on the eastern United States, where temperatures dropped to as low as 0°F in some areas.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of North American winter storms\n* December 2022 North American cold wave\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is based on information available as of December 31, 2022.\n\n# References\n\n* National Weather Service.

Founded in 1983, the bank grew to become one of the largest banks in the United States, serving a wide range of clients, from start-ups to established companies, venture capital firms, and private equity investors.\n\n# Foundation and Early Growth\n\nSilicon Valley Bank was founded in 1983 by Roger V. Smith and Robert Medearis in Santa Clara, California. Initially, the bank focused on providing banking services to the growing technology industry in the region. In its early years, SVB established relationships with many of the region's prominent venture capital firms, including Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia Capital. These partnerships enabled the bank to gain a deep understanding of the technology sector and its financing needs.\n\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, SVB experienced rapid growth, driven by the expansion of the technology industry in Silicon Valley. The bank's assets grew from $179 million in 1985 to over $1 billion by the end of 1995. SVB's success during this period was largely due to its ability to adapt to the changing needs of its clients, many of whom were start-ups and early-stage companies.\n\n# Expansion\n\nIn the early 2000s, SVB began to expand its operations beyond Silicon Valley, establishing offices in other major technology hubs, including San Francisco, San Diego, and Boston. The bank also expanded its product offerings, introducing new services such as asset management and private banking.\n\nIn 2008, SVB acquired the United Kingdom-based bank, SVB Capital, which had been established in 2004 to serve the bank's European clients. The acquisition marked SVB's entry into the European market and enabled the bank to provide its clients with a broader range of services, including cross-border banking and finance.\n\nDuring the 2010s, SVB continued to expand its operations, establishing new offices in cities such as New York, Austin, and Seattle. The bank also made several strategic acquisitions, including the purchase of the Boston-based bank, Square 1 Bank, in 2015.\n\n# Operations in Lead-up to Collapse\n\n## Business Model\n\nSVB's business model was centered around its ability to provide specialized banking services to the technology and innovation sectors. The bank's clients included a wide range of companies, from start-ups to established firms, as well as venture capital and private equity investors.\n\nSVB's services included traditional banking products, such as checking and savings accounts, loans, and credit cards. The bank also offered a range of specialized services, including asset management, private banking, and cross-border banking.\n\n## Facilities\n\nSVB operated a network of branches and offices in the United States, United Kingdom, and other countries. The bank's headquarters were located in Santa Clara, California, and it had major operations centers in cities such as San Francisco, New York, and Boston.\n\n## Affiliations and Community Involvement\n\nSVB was a member of several industry associations, including the Federal Reserve System and the Bank Administration Institute. The bank was also a sponsor of several industry events and conferences, including the annual Silicon Valley Bank Technology and Innovation Conference.\n\nSVB was involved in several community development initiatives, including the SVB Foundation, which provided grants and funding to non-profit organizations in the communities where the bank operated.\n\n# Collapse\n\nOn March 10, 2023, SVB announced that it had sold $21 billion of its securities portfolio at a loss, resulting in a net loss of $1.8 billion for the fourth quarter of 2022. The bank's shares plummeted, and on March 10, 2023, the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) took possession of SVB and placed it into receivership.\n\nThe collapse of SVB marked one of the largest bank failures in U.S. history, with the bank's assets valued at over $200 billion at the time of its failure. The collapse had significant implications for the technology and innovation sectors, with many of SVB's clients facing uncertainty and disruption to their operations.\n\n# References\n\n## Works Cited\n\n(Note: No citations or references are included in this article)\n\n# Further Reading\n\n* \"Silicon Valley Bank: A History\" by Roger V.

The ancient Romans made significant contributions to the field of surgery, developing new techniques, tools, and practices that would influence the course of medical history. From the early Republic to the late Empire, Roman surgeons performed a wide range of procedures, from routine treatments to complex operations.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\nThe history of surgery in ancient Rome is closely tied to the development of medicine as a whole. The earliest recorded medical practices in Rome date back to the 5th century BCE, with the arrival of Greek physicians such as Hippocrates and his followers. These early physicians brought with them their knowledge of human anatomy, pharmacology, and surgical techniques, which would eventually become the foundation of Roman surgery.\n\nAs Rome expanded its territories, it came into contact with various cultures, including the Egyptians, Greeks, and other Mediterranean civilizations. This exposure led to the adoption and adaptation of new medical practices, including surgical techniques. The Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder (23-79 CE) wrote extensively on medical topics, including surgery, and his works provide valuable insights into the state of surgical knowledge during the 1st century CE.\n\nThe peak of Roman surgical achievement occurred during the reign of the Emperor Trajan (98-117 CE), when the famous physician Galen (129-216 CE) practiced in Rome. Galen's writings on surgery, anatomy, and pharmacology would become the standard reference texts for centuries to come.\n\nTools\n-----\n\nRoman surgeons developed a wide range of tools to perform their craft. Many of these instruments were adapted from existing technologies, such as carpentry and metalworking. The following sections describe some of the most common surgical tools used in ancient Rome.\n\n### Cupping vessels\n\nCupping vessels were used to create suction on the skin, often to treat conditions such as headaches or skin lesions. These vessels were typically made of metal or horn and were applied to the skin using a flammable substance, such as oil or pitch.\n\n### Chisels and raspatories\n\nChisels and raspatories were used to cut and smooth bone and other hard tissues. These instruments were often used in procedures such as trephining (a form of skull surgery) and lithotomy (kidney stone removal).\n\n### Drills and levers\n\nDrills and levers were used to manipulate and remove objects from the body, such as arrowheads or kidney stones. These instruments were often used in combination with other tools, such as forceps or scalpels.\n\n### Saws and trephines\n\nSaws and trephines were used to cut through bone and other hard tissues. Trephines were particularly useful in procedures such as skull surgery, where a circular section of bone needed to be removed.\n\n### Forceps\n\nForceps were used to grasp and manipulate tissues or objects within the body. These instruments were often used in procedures such as tooth extraction or lithotomy.\n\n### Probes and curettes\n\nProbes and curettes were used to explore and clean cavities within the body, such as the nasal passages or uterus. These instruments were often used in procedures such as tonsillectomies or mastectomies.\n\n### Scalpels\n\nScalpels were used to make incisions in the skin and underlying tissues. These instruments were often used in procedures such as amputations or dissections.\n\n### Specula\n\nSpecula were used to dilate and examine body cavities, such as the vagina or anus. These instruments were often used in procedures such as gynecological examinations or rectal surgery.\n\n### Spoon of Diocles\n\nThe Spoon of Diocles was a specialized instrument used to remove the placenta during childbirth. This spoon-like instrument was designed to minimize damage to the uterus and surrounding tissues.\n\n### Catheters\n\nCatheters were used to introduce fluids or instruments into the body, often through the urethra or rectum. These instruments were often used in procedures such as urinary tract surgery or rectal examinations.\n\n### Strigils\n\nStrigils were used to scrape and clean the skin, often to remove dirt or sweat. These instruments were often used in athletic or therapeutic contexts.\n\n### Knives and needles\n\nKnives and needles were used to make incisions and suture wounds, respectively. These instruments were often used in procedures such as amputations or cosmetic surgery.\n\n### Hooks\n\nHooks were used to grasp and manipulate tissues or objects within the body, often in procedures such as tonsillectomies or mastectomies.\n\n### Other tools\n\nOther tools used in Roman surgery included retractors, elevators, and mallets. These instruments were often used to manipulate and remove tissues or objects within the body.\n\nTechniques\n----------\n\nRoman surgeons developed a wide range of techniques to perform various procedures. The following sections describe some of the most common surgical techniques used in ancient Rome.\n\n### Abortion\n\nAbortion was a common procedure in ancient Rome, often performed using herbal remedies or surgical instruments. The Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder wrote extensively on abortion techniques, including the use of pennyroyal and other herbs to induce miscarriage.\n\n### Amputations and dissections\n\nAmputations and dissections were often performed in cases of severe injury or disease. Roman surgeons developed techniques such as ligature and tourniquet to minimize blood loss and promote healing.\n\n### Bloodletting\n\nBloodletting was a common procedure in ancient Rome, often used to treat conditions such as fever or inflammation. Roman surgeons developed techniques such as venesection (cutting a vein) and cupping to remove blood from the body.\n\n### Caesarean section\n\nCaesarean section was a rare but sometimes necessary procedure in ancient Rome, often performed in cases of difficult childbirth. Roman surgeons developed techniques such as incision and extraction to deliver the baby safely.\n\n### Cataract surgery\n\nCataract surgery was a common procedure in ancient Rome, often performed using techniques such as couching (pushing the cataract back into the eye) or extraction (removing the cataract entirely).\n\n### Cosmetic surgery\n\nCosmetic surgery was a growing field in ancient Rome, often performed to correct defects such as cleft palate or crooked nose. Roman surgeons developed techniques such as skin grafting and bone reconstruction to improve appearance.\n\n### Hernia treatment\n\nHernia treatment was a common procedure in ancient Rome, often performed using techniques such as trussing (applying a supportive device) or surgery (repairing the hernia).\n\n### Lithotomy\n\nLithotomy was a common procedure in ancient Rome, often performed to remove kidney stones or other objects from the urinary tract. Roman surgeons developed techniques such as incision and extraction to remove the stone safely.\n\n### Neurosurgery\n\nNeurosurgery was a growing field in ancient Rome, often performed to treat conditions such as head trauma or brain tumors. Roman surgeons developed techniques such as trephining and craniotomy to access the brain.\n\n### Sutures, ligatures, and contractions\n\nSutures, ligatures, and contractions were used to close wounds and promote healing. Roman surgeons developed techniques such as stitching and binding to secure wounds.\n\n### Tonsillectomies and mastectomies\n\nTonsillectomies and mastectomies were common procedures in ancient Rome, often performed to treat conditions such as tonsillitis or breast cancer. Roman surgeons developed techniques such as excision and extraction to remove the affected tissue.\n\n### Tooth extraction\n\nTooth extraction was a common procedure in ancient Rome, often performed to treat conditions such as tooth decay or abscess. Roman surgeons developed techniques such as forceps and levering to remove the tooth safely.\n\n### Other techniques\n\nOther techniques used in Roman surgery included enucleation (removing an eye), salpingectomy (removing a fallopian tube), and orchiectomy (removing a testicle). These procedures were often performed to treat conditions such as eye disease, infertility, or testicular cancer.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n### Bibliography\n\n* Celsus, A. C. (trans. W. G.

This article explores the historical presence of Greeks in ancient Egypt, Ethiopia, Libya, and Nubia, highlighting their cultural, social, and economic contributions to these regions.\n\n# Ancient Egypt\n\nAncient Egypt was one of the earliest and most significant destinations for Greek settlers and traders. The Nile River provided a vital trade route, and the Egyptians' extensive knowledge of mathematics, architecture, and medicine attracted many Greek scholars and philosophers.\n\n## First historical colonies\n\nThe first recorded Greek presence in Egypt dates back to the 7th century BC, during the reign of Pharaoh Psamtik I. Greek mercenaries were employed by the pharaoh to help defend against Assyrian invasions. These early Greek settlers established themselves in the city of Naucratis, which became a major center of Greek culture and trade in Egypt.\n\n## Hellenistic times\n\n### Rule of Alexander the Great (332–323 BC)\n\nIn 332 BC, Alexander the Great conquered Egypt, marking the beginning of the Hellenistic period. Alexander founded the city of Alexandria, which would become a major hub of Greek culture, learning, and trade. The city's strategic location on the Mediterranean coast facilitated trade with other Greek city-states and the wider Mediterranean world.\n\n### The Ptolemaic Empire (323–30 BC)\n\nAfter Alexander's death, his general Ptolemy I Soter seized control of Egypt and established the Ptolemaic Empire. The Ptolemies were Macedonian Greeks who ruled Egypt for over three centuries, during which time they promoted Greek culture, language, and architecture. The Ptolemies also sponsored the construction of the Great Library of Alexandria, one of the largest and most significant repositories of knowledge in the ancient world.\n\n## Roman and Byzantine Egypt\n\nFollowing the death of Cleopatra VII in 30 BC, Egypt became a Roman province. During the Roman period, Greek culture continued to thrive, and many Greeks maintained prominent positions in Egyptian society. With the rise of Christianity in the 1st century AD, many Greeks in Egypt converted to the new faith, and by the 4th century AD, Christianity had become the dominant religion.\n\n### Coptic Greeks\n\nThe Coptic Greeks were a community of Greek-speaking Christians who lived in Egypt during the Roman and Byzantine periods. The Copts maintained a distinct cultural identity, blending Greek and Egyptian traditions. They developed a unique alphabet, which combined elements of the Greek alphabet with Demotic script, and produced a rich literary heritage, including the works of Coptic poets and theologians.\n\n# Ancient Ethiopia\n\nEthiopia has a long history of cultural and trade exchanges with the Mediterranean world, dating back to ancient times. Greek presence in Ethiopia is documented from the 3rd century BC, during the reign of the Axumite Empire.\n\n## Axumites of Ethiopia\n\nThe Axumites were a powerful and influential empire that flourished in the Horn of Africa from the 1st to the 8th century AD. They established trade relations with the Roman Empire and the Mediterranean world, and many Axumite rulers adopted Greek titles and symbols of power. The Axumites also developed a unique architectural style, which blended Greek and indigenous influences.\n\n## Abyssinian Greeks\n\nThe Abyssinian Greeks were a community of Greek-speaking Christians who lived in Ethiopia during the medieval period. They maintained close ties with the Byzantine Empire and played a significant role in the development of Ethiopian Christianity. The Abyssinian Greeks also contributed to the translation of Greek texts into Ge'ez, the ancient Ethiopian language.\n\n# Ancient Libya\n\nLibya has a long history of Greek presence, dating back to the 7th century BC. The city of Cyrene was founded by Greek colonizers from Thera, and it became a major center of Greek culture and trade in North Africa.\n\n## Libyan Greeks of Cyrenaica\n\nThe Libyan Greeks of Cyrenaica were a community of Greek-speaking inhabitants who lived in the region of Cyrenaica, in eastern Libya. They maintained a distinct cultural identity, blending Greek and indigenous traditions. The Libyan Greeks of Cyrenaica developed a unique dialect, which combined elements of the Greek language with local influences.\n\n## Libyan Greek culture\n\nLibyan Greek culture was characterized by a blend of Greek and indigenous influences. The Libyan Greeks developed a unique architectural style, which combined elements of Greek and Egyptian traditions. They also produced a rich literary heritage, including the works of Libyan Greek poets and philosophers.\n\n# Ancient Nubia\n\nNubia has a long history of cultural and trade exchanges with the Mediterranean world, dating back to ancient times. Greek presence in Nubia is documented from the 3rd century BC, during the reign of the Axumite Empire.\n\n## Axumite subjugation of Nubia\n\nIn the 3rd century AD, the Axumite Empire conquered Nubia, incorporating it into their vast territories. The Axumites imposed their own culture and language on the Nubians, and many Nubians adopted Greek titles and symbols of power.\n\n## Nubian Greeks\n\nThe Nubian Greeks were a community of Greek-speaking Christians who lived in Nubia during the medieval period. They maintained close ties with the Byzantine Empire and played a significant role in the development of Nubian Christianity. The Nubian Greeks also contributed to the translation of Greek texts into Old Nubian, the ancient Nubian language.\n\nIn conclusion, the history of African Greeks is a rich and complex one, spanning over two millennia. From ancient Egypt to Nubia, Greek communities have left a lasting legacy in the regions they inhabited, contributing to the development of local cultures, languages, and traditions.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"African_Greeks\" following this outline:\n\n#Ancient Egypt\n##First historical colonies\n##Hellenistic times\n###Rule of Alexander the Great (332–323 BC)\n###The Ptolemaic Empire (323–30 BC)\n##Roman and Byzantine Egypt\n###Coptic Greeks\n#Ancient Ethiopia\n##Axumites of Ethiopia\n##Abyssinian Greeks\n#Ancient Libya\n##Libyan Greeks of Cyrenaica\n##Libyan Greek culture\n#Ancient Nubia\n##Axumite subjugation of Nubia\n##Nubian Greeks\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This article provides an overview of the background, consequences, and lists of deaths of federal judges in active service.\n\n# Background\n\nThe US federal judiciary consists of the Supreme Court, the courts of appeals, the district courts, and the bankruptcy courts. Federal judges are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate for life terms, subject to good behavior. The death of a federal judge in active service creates a vacancy that must be filled through the appointment and confirmation process.\n\nFederal judges are responsible for interpreting and applying federal laws, resolving disputes, and ensuring justice is served. Their deaths can impact the administration of justice, the workload of other judges, and the overall functioning of the federal judiciary.\n\n# Political Consequences\n\nThe death of a federal judge in active service can have significant political consequences. The President must nominate a replacement, which requires Senate confirmation. The confirmation process can be contentious, with Senators from the opposing party potentially blocking or delaying the confirmation of the nominee.\n\nThe death of a federal judge can also impact the balance of power on the court, particularly if the judge was a member of a specific ideological or philosophical bloc. The appointment of a new judge can shift the balance of power, potentially altering the outcome of future cases.\n\nIn addition, the death of a federal judge can create opportunities for politicians to advance their own agendas or ideologies. For example, a President may use the opportunity to appoint a judge with a specific ideological or philosophical bent, potentially altering the direction of the court.\n\n# Logistical Consequences\n\nThe death of a federal judge in active service can have significant logistical consequences for the federal judiciary. The court must adjust its workload and scheduling to accommodate the loss of a judge, potentially leading to delays or inefficiencies.\n\nThe death of a federal judge can also impact the court's operations, particularly if the judge was responsible for managing specific cases or dockets. Other judges may need to take on additional responsibilities, potentially impacting their own workloads and efficiency.\n\nIn addition, the death of a federal judge can impact the court's morale and culture, particularly if the judge was well-respected or popular among colleagues.\n\n# Lists\n\nThe following lists provide an overview of deaths of United States federal judges in active service, organized by time period.\n\n## 1789–1869\n\n* John Jay (1789–1795): died June 17, 1829\n* William Cushing (1789–1810): died September 13, 1810\n* James Wilson (1789–1798): died August 21, 1798\n* John Blair (1790–1796): died August 31, 1830\n* Robert Hanson Harrison (1790–1792): died April 2, 1792\n* Thomas Johnson (1792–1793): died October 26, 1819\n* William Paterson (1793–1806): died September 9, 1806\n* Samuel Chase (1796–1811): died June 19, 1811\n* Bushrod Washington (1799–1829): died November 26, 1829\n* Alfred Moore (1800–1804): died October 15, 1810\n* William Johnson (1804–1834): died August 4, 1834\n* Brockholst Livingston (1807–1823): died March 18, 1823\n* Thomas Todd (1807–1826): died February 7, 1826\n* Gabriel Duvall (1811–1835): died March 6, 1844\n* Joseph Story (1812–1845): died September 10, 1845\n* Smith Thompson (1823–1843): died December 18, 1843\n* Robert Trimble (1826–1828): died August 25, 1828\n* John McLean (1830–1861): died April 4, 1861\n\n## 1870–1919\n\n* Noah Haynes Swayne (1862–1881): died June 8, 1884\n* Stephen J.

The protests were sparked by the country's worst economic crisis since its independence in 1948, which led to widespread poverty, inflation, and shortages of essential goods.\n\n# Background\n\nSri Lanka has been facing a severe economic crisis since 2021, with a sharp decline in foreign exchange reserves, a significant increase in inflation, and a severe shortage of essential goods such as food, fuel, and medicine. The crisis was caused by a combination of factors, including a decline in tourism revenue due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a decrease in remittances from Sri Lankan workers abroad, and a significant increase in imports.\n\nThe government's decision to ban the importation of chemical fertilizers in 2021, which led to a significant decline in agricultural production, exacerbated the crisis. The shortage of essential goods led to long queues and shortages in supermarkets, hospitals, and other essential services.\n\n# Timeline\n\n## March\n\nThe protests began on March 15, 2022, with a small group of demonstrators gathering outside the president's residence in Colombo. The protesters demanded the resignation of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and his government, which they blamed for the economic crisis.\n\n## April\n\n### Declaration of state of emergency\n\nOn April 1, 2022, President Rajapaksa declared a state of emergency, which gave the military sweeping powers to arrest and detain protesters.

She was a prominent and respected journalist in the Middle East, known for her fearless and objective reporting on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Abu Akleh's career spanned over two decades, during which she covered numerous significant events, including the Second Intifada and the Gaza wars.\n\n# Early life and education\n\nShireen Abu Akleh was born on April 3, 1971, in Jerusalem, to a Palestinian Christian family. Her family moved to the United States when she was a young girl, and she grew up in New Jersey. Abu Akleh returned to the Middle East to pursue a career in journalism, earning a degree in journalism from Yarmouk University in Jordan.\n\n# Career\n\nAbu Akleh began her career in journalism in the late 1990s, working for various Palestinian and Arab media outlets.
