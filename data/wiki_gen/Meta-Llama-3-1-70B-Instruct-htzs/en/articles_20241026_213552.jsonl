The dynasty is mentioned in various sources, including the Shahnameh, the national epic of Iran, and the works of the Persian historian Tabari.\n\n# Origins, etymology and sources\n\nThe term \"Pishdadian\" is derived from the Persian word \"Pishdad\", which means \"first created\" or \"original\". The Pishdadian dynasty is said to have been the first dynasty of Iran, and its kings are believed to have ruled the country from the earliest times.\n\nThe Pishdadian dynasty is mentioned in various sources, including the Shahnameh, the national epic of Iran, which was written by the Persian poet Ferdowsi in the 10th century CE.

The path stretches from the Santa Monica Bay to the city of Culver City, passing through the cities of Los Angeles and Marina del Rey. The bike path is popular among cyclists, joggers, and inline skaters, and provides a scenic route through the Ballona Creek watershed.\n\n# Route\nThe Ballona Creek Bike Path begins at the intersection of Pacific Avenue and Culver Drive in Marina del Rey, near the Santa Monica Bay. The path heads east, paralleling Ballona Creek, and passes through the cities of Los Angeles and Culver City. Along the way, the path passes through several parks and open spaces, including the Ballona Wetlands and the Culver City Park.\n\n## Airport\nOne notable section of the bike path runs adjacent to Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). Cyclists can see planes taking off and landing on the airport's runways as they ride along this section of the path. The airport section is also home to several large industrial and commercial developments, including the LAX Airport Business Park.\n\n# Conditions\nThe Ballona Creek Bike Path is generally well-maintained and suitable for a wide range of users. However, there are some conditions that cyclists and other users should be aware of.\n\n## Rest stops\nThere are several rest stops along the bike path, including benches, drinking fountains, and restrooms. These rest stops provide a convenient place for users to take a break and rest their legs.\n\n## Homeless camping\nUnfortunately, the Ballona Creek Bike Path has been the site of homeless camping in recent years. Homeless individuals have set up encampments along the path, particularly in the areas near the Culver City and Los Angeles city limits. While the city and county have made efforts to address the issue, the presence of homeless encampments can be a concern for users of the path.\n\n# Access gates\nThe Ballona Creek Bike Path has several access gates along its length, which provide entry and exit points for users. These gates are typically located at major intersections and provide a safe and convenient way for users to join or leave the path.\n\n# History\nThe Ballona Creek Bike Path was built in the 1970s and 1980s, as part of a larger effort to develop the Ballona Creek watershed. The path was constructed on top of an existing flood control channel, which had been built in the 1950s and 1960s to control flooding in the area. Over the years, the path has been improved and expanded, with new sections added and existing sections upgraded.\n\n# Improvements\nThere have been several improvements made to the Ballona Creek Bike Path in recent years. These include the installation of new lighting and signage, the repair of damaged pavement, and the addition of new amenities such as benches and drinking fountains. Additionally, the city and county have made efforts to address the issue of homeless camping along the path, including the establishment of a homeless outreach program.\n\n# Proposed extensions\nThere are several proposed extensions to the Ballona Creek Bike Path, which would connect the path to other bike paths and transportation routes in the region. One proposed extension would connect the path to the Expo Line light rail, which runs from Santa Monica to Downtown Los Angeles. Another proposed extension would connect the path to the Marvin Braude Bike Trail, which runs along the Santa Monica Bay.\n\n# Gallery\n[Insert images of the Ballona Creek Bike Path]\n\n# See also\n* Ballona Creek\n* Ballona Wetlands\n* Culver City Park\n* Los Angeles International Airport\n* Marvin Braude Bike Trail\n* Expo Line (Los Angeles Metro)\n\n# References\n\n# External links\n* City of Los Angeles Department of Transportation: Ballona Creek Bike Path\n* County of Los Angeles Department of Public Works: Ballona Creek Bike Path\n* Ballona Creek Renaissance: A non-profit organization dedicated to improving the Ballona Creek watershed.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Ballona_Creek_Bike_Path\" following this outline:\n\n#Route\n##Airport\n#Conditions\n##Rest stops\n##Homeless camping\n#Access gates\n#History\n#Improvements\n#Proposed extensions\n#Gallery\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Rush was a pioneer in the field of deep-sea exploration, and his work significantly contributed to the advancement of underwater filmmaking and scientific research.\n\n# Early Life\n\nStockton Rush was born on May 31, 1962, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Growing up in a family of modest means, Rush developed a strong sense of adventure and curiosity from an early age. He spent much of his childhood exploring the outdoors, and his parents encouraged his interest in science and nature. Rush's early fascination with the ocean and its mysteries would eventually shape his future career.\n\nRush attended the University of Pennsylvania, where he studied geology and biology. During his undergraduate years, he became increasingly interested in the field of oceanography, and he began to explore opportunities for research and exploration. After graduating, Rush worked as a research assistant on several oceanographic expeditions, which further solidified his passion for the ocean.\n\n## Early Expeditions\n\nIn the late 1980s, Rush participated in several deep-sea expeditions, including a research voyage to the Galapagos Islands. These early experiences not only honed his skills as a researcher but also instilled in him a sense of adventure and a desire to explore the ocean's unknown regions.\n\n# Career\n\nRush's career as an explorer and filmmaker spanned over three decades. He worked on numerous documentary films and television series, often focusing on the ocean and its inhabitants. His work took him to some of the most remote and inhospitable regions on Earth, including the Arctic and the Antarctic.\n\n## DeepFlight Super Falcon 3S\n\nIn 2000, Rush co-founded DeepFlight, a company that designed and manufactured advanced underwater vehicles. The DeepFlight Super Falcon 3S, a submersible vessel, was one of Rush's most notable creations. The 3S was capable of reaching depths of over 400 feet and was used in various research and filming expeditions.\n\n## OceanGate\n\nIn 2009, Rush co-founded OceanGate, a company that specialized in manned submersibles and underwater exploration.

Rush served as the company's CEO and was instrumental in the development of the Titan expedition.\n\n# Titan Expedition and Death\n\nOn June 18, 2019, Rush led the Titan expedition to the ocean floor of the Mariana Trench. The dive was part of a larger research and filming project, which aimed to explore the trench's unique ecosystem and document the experience. Rush piloted the Titan, accompanied by four other crew members.\n\nTragically, the expedition ended in disaster. On June 18, 2019, at approximately 1:45 PM local time, the Titan imploded, killing all five crew members on board. The incident occurred at a depth of around 35,800 feet, and the cause of the implosion is still under investigation.\n\n## Aftermath\n\nThe loss of the Titan expedition was met with shock and sadness from the scientific community and the general public. Rush's death was mourned by his colleagues, friends, and family, who remembered him as a passionate and dedicated explorer.\n\n# Personal Life\n\nStockton Rush was married to his wife, Lori, and had two children. He was known for his adventurous spirit, his love of the ocean, and his dedication to his work. Rush was also an avid pilot and enjoyed flying in his free time.\n\n## Legacy\n\nRush's legacy as an explorer and filmmaker continues to inspire new generations of scientists, researchers, and adventurers.

The election saw the participation of several political parties, with the centre-left and centre-right blocs being the main contenders for power. The election was marked by a significant increase in support for the right-wing Sweden Democrats, who emerged as the second-largest party in the Riksdag.\n\nBackground\n\n### Löfven's Government\n\nIn 2018, Stefan Löfven, the leader of the Social Democratic Party, formed a minority government with the Green Party, following a protracted period of negotiations with other parties. The government's agenda focused on issues such as climate change, immigration, and economic growth. However, the government faced significant challenges, including a decline in public trust and a rise in support for the Sweden Democrats.\n\n### Andersson's Government\n\nIn November 2021, Magdalena Andersson, the leader of the Social Democratic Party, succeeded Stefan Löfven as Prime Minister. Andersson's government continued to implement the policies of the previous government, with a focus on issues such as climate change and economic growth. However, the government faced significant opposition from the centre-right parties and the Sweden Democrats, who criticized the government's policies on immigration and law and order.\n\nElectoral System\n\nThe Swedish electoral system is based on proportional representation, with voters casting ballots for parties rather than individual candidates.

Mary was the daughter of King Henry VIII and his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, and she was the first queen regnant of England. The coronation was a grand affair, with elaborate ceremonies, processions, and festivities, which were designed to showcase the new queen's power and authority.\n\nProclamation on 19 July\n\nThe coronation began with a proclamation, which was read out in the streets of London and in other towns and cities across the country. The proclamation announced Mary's accession to the throne and called upon all loyal subjects to recognize her as their rightful queen. It also declared that Mary would be crowned on the following day, July 19, at Westminster Abbey.\n\nThe Oration gratulatory\n\nBefore the coronation ceremony, a Latin oration was delivered by Dr. Nicholas Heath, the Bishop of Worcester. The oration was a formal address, which praised Mary's virtues and qualifications for the throne, and called upon her to rule wisely and justly. The oration was an important part of the coronation ceremony, as it helped to establish Mary's legitimacy as queen and to set the tone for her reign.\n\nPlays and drama at the coronation\n\nThe coronation was also marked by plays and drama, which were performed in the streets of London and at court. These performances were designed to entertain the queen and her guests, and to celebrate the occasion. One of the most famous plays performed during the coronation was a pageant, which depicted the story of Mary's ancestors and her rightful claim to the throne.\n\nRoyal Entry to London\n\nThe royal entry to London was a grand procession, which took place on the eve of the coronation. Mary rode through the streets of London, surrounded by her nobles, courtiers, and guards. The procession was a spectacular sight, with elaborate floats, decorations, and costumes. Mary was dressed in a magnificent gown, which was designed to showcase her wealth and status.\n\n### Coronation eve\n\nOn the eve of the coronation, Mary attended a special service at Westminster Abbey, where she prayed and prepared for the ceremony ahead. The service was attended by the nobility and clergy, and it was an important part of the coronation ritual.\n\n### The coronation entry\n\nThe next day, Mary made her formal entry into Westminster Abbey, where she was greeted by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Cranmer. The archbishop was a key player in the coronation ceremony, as he would anoint and crown Mary. The entry was a grand affair, with Mary surrounded by her nobles and courtiers.\n\nCoronation\n\nThe coronation ceremony took place in the presence of the nobility, clergy, and other dignitaries. The ceremony was divided into several parts, each of which had its own significance and importance.\n\n### The mount and St Edward's chair\n\nThe ceremony began with Mary's procession to the mount, a raised platform in the center of the abbey. There, she sat in St Edward's chair, a ancient throne that had been used in coronations for centuries. The chair was an important symbol of the monarchy, and it was said to have been used by St Edward the Confessor, one of England's most revered kings.\n\n### The traverse\n\nThe next part of the ceremony was the traverse, a ritual in which Mary was presented to the congregation and acclaimed as queen. The traverse was an important part of the coronation, as it helped to establish Mary's legitimacy and authority.\n\n### Three crowns and two sceptres\n\nMary was crowned with three crowns, which symbolized her three roles as queen: her spiritual role as the head of the Church of England, her temporal role as the monarch of England, and her imperial role as the ruler of the British Empire. She was also given two sceptres, which represented her power and authority. The sceptres were decorated with precious stones and gold, and they were an important part of the coronation ritual.\n\nBanquet in Westminster Hall\n\nAfter the coronation ceremony, Mary attended a grand banquet in Westminster Hall, which was attended by the nobility and other dignitaries. The banquet was a spectacular affair, with elaborate food, drink, and entertainment.\n\n### The champion\n\nThe banquet was also attended by the champion, a knight who represented the queen's authority and power. The champion was a key player in the banquet, as he would defend the queen's honor and reputation.\n\n### Proclamation\n\nDuring the banquet, a proclamation was read out, which announced Mary's accession to the throne and called upon all loyal subjects to recognize her as their rightful queen. The proclamation was an important part of the coronation ritual, as it helped to establish Mary's legitimacy and authority.\n\nCostume\n\nThe coronation was also marked by elaborate costumes, which were designed to showcase the queen's wealth and status. Mary wore a magnificent gown, which was decorated with precious stones and gold. The gown was an important part of the coronation ritual, as it helped to establish Mary's legitimacy and authority.\n\n### Blue and ray cloth\n\nMary's gown was made of blue and ray cloth, which were expensive and luxurious fabrics. The gown was an important symbol of the monarchy, and it was said to have been worn by previous queens.\n\n### Anointing and a change of costume\n\nDuring the coronation ceremony, Mary was anointed with holy oil, which was an important part of the coronation ritual. After the anointing, Mary changed into a new costume, which was designed to showcase her spiritual role as the head of the Church of England.\n\n### Gentlewomen and chamberers\n\nMary was attended by gentlewomen and chamberers, who helped her to dress and prepare for the coronation ceremony. The gentlewomen and chamberers were an important part of the coronation ritual, as they helped to establish Mary's legitimacy and authority.\n\n### Reuse of coronation clothes by Elizabeth I\n\nMary's coronation clothes were later reused by her half-sister, Elizabeth I, who also wore them during her coronation ceremony. The reuse of coronation clothes was an important part of the coronation ritual, as it helped to establish continuity and legitimacy between monarchs.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Coronation_of_Mary_I_of_England\" following this outline:\n\n#Proclamation on 19 July\n#The Oration gratulatory\n#Plays and drama at the coronation\n#Royal Entry to London\n##Coronation eve\n##The coronation entry\n#Coronation\n##The mount and St Edward's chair\n##The traverse\n##Three crowns and two sceptres\n#Banquet in Westminster Hall\n##The champion\n##Proclamation\n#Costume\n##Blue and ray cloth\n##Anointing and a change of costume\n##Gentlewomen and chamberers\n##Reuse of coronation clothes by Elizabeth I\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The film is the fifth installment in the Indiana Jones franchise and stars Harrison Ford reprising his role as the iconic archaeologist Indiana Jones.\n\nPlot\n-----\n\nThe film takes place in 1969, during the Space Age, and follows Indiana Jones as he navigates a complex web of intrigue and deception. The story centers around the Dial of Destiny, an ancient artifact with the power to manipulate time and space. Jones must confront his past and team up with his goddaughter, Helena Shaw, to prevent the Dial from falling into the wrong hands.\n\nAs Jones embarks on a perilous journey to uncover the secrets of the Dial, he faces off against a new adversary, Jürgen Voller, a former Nazi who has managed to survive the war and is now obsessed with harnessing the power of the artifact. Along the way, Jones must also contend with the challenges of the modern world, including the rise of technology and the decline of traditional values.\n\nCast\n----\n\n* Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones\n* Phoebe Waller-Bridge as Helena Shaw, Jones's goddaughter\n* Mads Mikkelsen as Jürgen Voller, the main antagonist\n* Thomas Kretschmann as Colonel Weber, a former Nazi officer\n* Boyd Holbrook as Klaber, a CIA agent\n* Shaunette Renée Wilson as Mason, a NASA engineer\n\nProduction\n------------\n\n### Development\n\nDevelopment on the fifth Indiana Jones film began in 2016, with Steven Spielberg set to direct and Harrison Ford reprising his role as Indiana Jones. However, in 2018, Spielberg left the project, and James Mangold was brought on board to direct and co-write the script.\n\n### Pre-production\n\nPre-production on the film began in 2020, with a scheduled release date of July 2022. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, production was delayed, and the release date was pushed back to 2023.\n\n### Casting\n\nCasting for the film began in 2020, with Phoebe Waller-Bridge joining the cast as Helena Shaw, Jones's goddaughter. Mads Mikkelsen was cast as the main antagonist, Jürgen Voller, and Thomas Kretschmann was cast as Colonel Weber, a former Nazi officer.\n\n### Filming\n\nPrincipal photography on the film began in June 2021 and wrapped in February 2022. Filming took place in various locations, including the United Kingdom, Morocco, and Italy.\n\n### Visual effects\n\nThe visual effects for the film were handled by Industrial Light & Magic, with a team of over 1,000 artists and technicians working on the project.\n\n#### De-aging\n\nOne of the most significant visual effects challenges for the film was de-aging Harrison Ford to make him appear younger in certain scenes. The de-aging process involved a combination of facial capture technology and machine learning algorithms.\n\n### Music\n\nThe score for the film was composed by John Williams, who has scored all of the previous Indiana Jones films.

With a rich history spanning thousands of years, Ukraine has been a major cultural and economic hub in the region. The country has a diverse landscape, with fertile plains, mountains, and a long coastline along the Black Sea. Ukraine is home to over 41 million people, making it the 35th most populous country in the world.\n\n# Etymology and orthography\n\nThe name \"Ukraine\" is derived from the Old East Slavic word \"ukraina,\" meaning \"borderland\" or \"frontier.\" The term has been used to describe the region since the 16th century. The modern Ukrainian language is a member of the East Slavic branch of the Indo-European language family, closely related to Russian and Belarusian. Ukrainian orthography is based on the Cyrillic alphabet, with some unique letters and diacritical marks.\n\n# History\n\n## Early history\n\nThe territory of modern Ukraine has been inhabited since ancient times. The Neolithic Cucuteni-Trypillia culture flourished in the region from around 5500 to 2750 BCE. The Scythians, a nomadic people from modern-day Iran, arrived in the 7th century BCE and established a powerful kingdom that lasted until the 3rd century BCE. The ancient Greeks established colonies along the Black Sea coast, including the city of Olbia, which became a major center of trade and culture.\n\n## Golden Age of Kyiv\n\nIn the 9th century CE, the state of Kievan Rus' was founded by Prince Oleg, with its capital in Kyiv. During the reign of Prince Vladimir the Great (980-1015), Kievan Rus' adopted Christianity from Byzantium. The state reached its golden age under the rule of Prince Yaroslav the Wise (1019-1054), who established a strong centralized government, a system of laws, and a flourishing culture. Kievan Rus' became a major power in Eastern Europe, with extensive trade and cultural ties to Byzantium, the Holy Roman Empire, and the Arab world.\n\n## Foreign domination\n\nIn the 13th century, Kievan Rus' was invaded by the Mongols, who destroyed many cities and towns, including Kyiv. The state was eventually absorbed into the Golden Horde, a Mongol khanate. In the 14th century, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland began to expand into Ukrainian territory, establishing their own rule over much of the region. The Crimean Khanate, a Turkic state, was established in the 15th century and became a major power in the region, controlling much of the Black Sea coast.\n\n## Cossack Hetmanate\n\nIn the 16th century, the Cossacks, a group of free warriors and settlers, established the Zaporizhian Sich, a fortified settlement in the steppes of southern Ukraine. The Cossacks became a major military force in the region, fighting against the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Ottoman Empire. In 1648, the Cossack Hetmanate was established, with its capital in Chyhyryn. The Hetmanate became a semi-autonomous state, with its own government, laws, and military.\n\n## 19th and early 20th century\n\nIn the 19th century, Ukraine was a province of the Russian Empire, with its own administration and laws. The Ukrainian national movement began to emerge, with demands for greater autonomy and cultural rights. The 20th century saw the rise of Ukrainian nationalism, with the establishment of the Ukrainian People's Republic in 1917. However, the republic was soon absorbed into the Soviet Union, and Ukraine became one of the founding republics of the USSR.\n\n## Inter-war period\n\nDuring the inter-war period, Ukraine was a Soviet republic, with its own government and laws. However, the Ukrainian national movement continued to exist, with demands for greater autonomy and cultural rights. The Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church was established in 1919, and the Ukrainian language and culture were promoted through education and the arts.\n\n## World War II\n\nDuring World War II, Ukraine was invaded by Nazi Germany, which established a brutal occupation regime. The Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) was established in 1942, with the goal of establishing an independent Ukrainian state. The UPA fought against both the Nazis and the Soviet Union, but was eventually defeated.\n\n## Post–war Soviet Ukraine\n\nAfter the war, Ukraine became a Soviet republic once again, with its own government and laws. However, the Ukrainian national movement continued to exist, with demands for greater autonomy and cultural rights. The Ukrainian language and culture were promoted through education and the arts, and the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church was re-established.\n\n## Independence\n\nIn 1991, Ukraine declared its independence from the Soviet Union, with Leonid Kravchuk as its first president. The country established its own government, laws, and institutions, and began to develop its own economy and culture. In 2014, Ukraine signed an association agreement with the European Union, and in 2019, the country elected a new president, Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\n# Geography\n\n## Climate\n\nUkraine has a temperate climate, with cold winters and warm summers.

Growing up in a family of modest means, Kang developed a passion for drawing and storytelling from an early age.

The museum was founded in 1820 and has a rich history of collecting and exhibiting various artifacts and artworks.\n\n# History\n\nThe Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt was founded in 1820 by Grand Duke Louis I of Hesse, who was a patron of the arts and sciences. The museum was initially located in the Old Palace in Darmstadt and was known as the \"Großherzoglich Hessisches Museum\" (Grand Ducal Hessian Museum). The museum's first collection consisted of artworks and artifacts that had been gathered by the Grand Duke during his travels.\n\nIn the 19th century, the museum underwent significant expansions, with the addition of new collections and the construction of a new building. In 1877, the museum moved to its current location on Friedensplatz in Darmstadt. The building was designed by architect Alfred Messel and was completed in 1906.\n\nDuring World War II, the museum suffered significant damage, and many of its collections were lost or destroyed. After the war, the museum underwent a major reconstruction effort, and many of its collections were rebuilt.\n\n# Building\n\n## Location\n\nThe Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt is located on Friedensplatz in the heart of Darmstadt, Germany. The museum is situated in a beautiful park-like setting, surrounded by several other cultural institutions, including the Darmstadt State Theatre and the Central Station.\n\n## Renovations and extensions\n\nIn the 1990s, the museum underwent a major renovation effort, which included the restoration of the original building and the addition of new exhibition spaces. The renovation was designed by architect Peter Kulka and was completed in 2001.\n\nIn 2014, the museum opened a new wing, which was designed by architect Dieter Quiram. The new wing provides additional exhibition space and features a striking glass façade.\n\n# Collections\n\nThe Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt has a diverse range of collections, including artworks, cultural artifacts, and natural history specimens. The museum's collections include:\n\n* European art from the 14th to the 20th centuries, including works by artists such as Rubens, Rembrandt, and Picasso\n* A collection of ancient Greek and Roman art, including sculptures and coins\n* A collection of cultural artifacts from around the world, including textiles, jewelry, and musical instruments\n* A natural history collection, including specimens of plants, animals, and minerals\n\n# Gallery\n\nThe museum's gallery features a range of temporary and permanent exhibitions. Some of the museum's most popular exhibitions include:\n\n* The \"Darmstadt Madonna\" by Hans Holbein the Younger, a famous painting that is considered one of the museum's greatest treasures\n* The \"Hessian Crown Jewels,\" a collection of precious gems and jewelry that belonged to the Grand Dukes of Hesse\n* The \"Art Nouveau Collection,\" a collection of artworks and decorative objects from the early 20th century\n\n# Special exhibitions\n\nThe museum hosts a range of special exhibitions throughout the year, including exhibitions on art, history, and science. Some recent exhibitions have included:\n\n* \"The Art of the Renaissance,\" an exhibition of artworks from the 15th and 16th centuries\n* \"The History of Darmstadt,\" an exhibition on the city's history and culture\n* \"The Science of Nature,\" an exhibition on the natural world and the latest scientific discoveries\n\n# Controversies\n\nThe museum has been involved in several controversies over the years, including:\n\n* In 2019, the museum was criticized for its handling of a collection of artifacts that had been looted by the Nazis during World War II. The museum eventually agreed to restitute the artifacts to their rightful owners.\n* In 2020, the museum was criticized for its decision to exhibit a collection of artworks that had been created by artists who had been involved in the Nazi party. The museum argued that the exhibition was intended to spark a conversation about the role of art in politics.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of museums in Germany\n* List of art museums in Germany\n* List of natural history museums in Germany\n\n# Films\n\n* \"The Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt\" (2019), a documentary film about the museum's history and collections\n* \"The Darmstadt Madonna\" (2020), a film about the museum's famous painting by Hans Holbein the Younger\n\n# References\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)\n\n# Further reading\n\n* \"The Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt: A Guide to the Collections\" (2019), a book about the museum's collections and exhibitions\n* \"The History of the Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt\" (2020), a book about the museum's history and development\n\n# External links\n\n* Official website of the Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt\n* Wikipedia article on the Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt (in German)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Hessisches_Landesmuseum_Darmstadt\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n#Building\n##Location\n##Renovations and extensions\n#Collections\n#Gallery\n#Special exhibitions\n#Controversies\n#See also\n#Films\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The counteroffensive aimed to retake control of the Kharkiv Oblast, which had been partially occupied by Russian forces since the beginning of the invasion in February 2022. The operation was a significant turning point in the war, as it marked a major shift in momentum in favor of Ukraine and led to the recapture of large areas of territory.\n\n# Background\n\nThe Kharkiv Oblast had been a key battleground since the start of the Russian invasion. In February 2022, Russian forces had quickly advanced into the region, capturing several major cities, including Kharkiv, the second-largest city in Ukraine. However, the Ukrainian military had managed to hold onto some areas, including the city of Kharkiv, which had been subject to intense shelling and bombardment. Despite being outnumbered and outgunned, the Ukrainian military had maintained a presence in the region, carrying out guerrilla attacks and sabotage operations against Russian forces.\n\n# Prelude\n\nIn the months leading up to the counteroffensive, the Ukrainian military had been quietly building up its strength in the Kharkiv region. Troops had been redeployed from other areas of the country, and new equipment and supplies had been brought in. The Ukrainian military had also been conducting a series of small-scale operations, aimed at weakening Russian positions and gathering intelligence.\n\nIn August 2022, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced that a major counteroffensive was planned, but did not give a specific date or details. The announcement was seen as a attempt to distract Russian forces and disrupt their plans, as well as to boost morale among Ukrainian troops.\n\n# Counteroffensive\n\nThe counteroffensive began on September 6, 2022, with a series of coordinated attacks across the Kharkiv Oblast.\n\n## First phase (6–12 September 2022)\n\n### Initial advance\n\nThe initial advance was led by Ukrainian infantry and armor units, which pushed forward from their positions in the north and east of the region. The Russian military had been expecting an attack, but was caught off guard by the speed and ferocity of the Ukrainian advance. Russian forces were quickly overwhelmed, and were forced to retreat from several key positions.\n\n### Breakthrough\n\nOn September 8, 2022, Ukrainian forces achieved a major breakthrough, breaking through Russian lines and advancing deep into occupied territory. The breakthrough allowed Ukrainian forces to capture several key towns and villages, including the strategic town of Balakliia.\n\n### Russian withdrawal from Kharkiv Oblast west of Oskil River\n\nAs the Ukrainian advance continued, Russian forces began to withdraw from the western part of the Kharkiv Oblast. The withdrawal was orderly, but Ukrainian forces were able to capture several key positions, including the town of Izium, which had been a major Russian stronghold.\n\n### Other gains and casualties\n\nOver the course of the first phase, Ukrainian forces made significant gains, capturing large areas of territory and inflicting heavy casualties on Russian forces. However, the Ukrainian military also suffered significant losses, including several high-ranking officers.\n\n## Battle of Shevchenkove\n\nThe Battle of Shevchenkove was a key engagement during the first phase of the counteroffensive. The battle took place on September 9, 2022, and involved a Ukrainian attempt to capture the strategic village of Shevchenkove. Russian forces put up fierce resistance, but were ultimately forced to retreat. The battle was seen as a major victory for the Ukrainian military, and marked a turning point in the counteroffensive.\n\n## Second phase (13 September–1 October 2022)\n\n### Oskil River crossing\n\nOn September 13, 2022, Ukrainian forces launched a major operation to cross the Oskil River, which marked the boundary between the Kharkiv and Donetsk Oblasts. The operation was successful, and Ukrainian forces were able to establish a foothold on the eastern bank of the river.\n\n### Encirclement and recapture of Lyman\n\nOver the course of the next several days, Ukrainian forces encircled the strategic town of Lyman, which had been a key Russian stronghold. On October 1, 2022, Ukrainian forces recaptured the town, marking a major victory and a significant turning point in the war.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## Russia\n\nThe Russian government was caught off guard by the Ukrainian counteroffensive, and was initially slow to respond. However, as the extent of the Ukrainian gains became clear, the Russian government began to take action. Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a major mobilization of Russian troops, and threatened", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Kharkiv_counteroffensive\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Prelude\n#Counteroffensive\n##First phase (6–12 September 2022)\n###Initial advance\n###Breakthrough\n###Russian withdrawal from Kharkiv Oblast west of Oskil River\n###Other gains and casualties\n##Battle of Shevchenkove\n##Second phase (13 September–1 October 2022)\n###Oskil River crossing\n###Encirclement and recapture of Lyman\n#Reactions\n##Russia\n##Worldwide\n#Aftermath of the first phase\n##Mass graves and evidence of torture\n##Military decorations\n##Effect on Russian referendums\n##Captured Russian equipment\n#Aftermath of the second phase\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Amis continued to publish innovative and influential novels, including London Fields (1989) and Time's Arrow (1991). These works cemented his reputation as a master of complex, lyrical prose and a bold explorer of themes such as politics, history, and personal identity.\n\n## 2000s\n\nIn the 2000s, Amis continued to experiment with form and style, publishing novels such as The Information (1995) and Experience (2000), a memoir that explored his relationship with his father, Kingsley Amis. He also published a collection of essays, The War Against Cliché (2001), which showcased his critical thinking and intellectual curiosity. Amis's writing during this period often explored themes of politics, history, and personal identity, and he became known for his provocative and incisive commentary on contemporary issues.\n\n## 2010s and 2020s\n\nIn the 2010s and 2020s, Amis continued to publish innovative and influential works, including the novels Lionel Asbo (2012) and The Zone of Interest (2014). He also published a collection of essays, The Second Plane (2008), which explored the impact of 9/11 and the War on Terror on Western society.

He has taught creative writing at several universities, including Manchester and Columbia, and has been a vocal advocate for the importance of literary education.\n\n# Personal life\n\nAmis has been married twice, first to Antonia Phillips and then to Isis Rowe.

The alliance was created to contest the 2022 French legislative election and to provide a unified left-wing opposition to the presidential majority.\n\n# History\n\n## Formation\n\nThe New Ecological and Social People's Union was formed on May 4, 2022, after several weeks of negotiations between the member parties. The alliance was created in response to the poor performance of the left-wing parties in the 2022 French presidential election, where none of the candidates from the PS, PCF, EELV, or LFI made it to the second round. The NUPES aimed to provide a unified left-wing alternative to the presidential majority and to promote a progressive agenda.\n\n## Expansion\n\nIn the weeks following its formation, the NUPES expanded to include several other left-wing parties and organizations, such as the Pirate Party, the New Deal, and the Movement of Progressives. The alliance also attracted the support of several prominent left-wing intellectuals and activists.\n\n## 2022 French legislative election\n\nThe NUPES contested the 2022 French legislative election, with a total of 566 candidates across the country. The alliance presented a unified platform, emphasizing issues such as social justice, environmental protection, and democratic reform. The NUPES also committed to promoting a more participatory and inclusive form of democracy.\n\n## Electoral results and aftermath\n\nThe NUPES performed relatively well in the 2022 French legislative election, winning 131 seats in the National Assembly. However, the alliance fell short of its goal of winning a majority of seats, and the presidential majority retained its control of the legislature. The NUPES's electoral results were seen as a disappointment by some, but the alliance's leaders argued that the results were still a significant improvement over the left-wing parties' performance in previous elections.\n\n## Election of René Pilato\n\nIn the aftermath of the legislative election, the NUPES elected René Pilato as its leader in the National Assembly. Pilato, a member of the PS, was seen as a compromise candidate who could unite the different parties within the alliance.\n\n## Quatennens Affair\n\nIn September 2022, the NUPES was rocked by the Quatennens affair, in which Adrien Quatennens, a prominent LFI deputy, was accused of domestic violence. Quatennens denied the allegations, but he was eventually expelled from the LFI and suspended from the NUPES.\n\n## Bayou Affair\n\nIn October 2022, the NUPES was embroiled in another controversy, known as the Bayou affair. The controversy centered on the NUPES's decision to support a candidate in the overseas department of French Guiana, who was accused of corruption. The affair led to tensions within the NUPES, with some members calling for greater transparency and accountability.\n\n## Tensions with the Communist Party\n\nThe NUPES has experienced tensions with the Communist Party (PCF), one of its member parties. The PCF has been critical of the NUPES's decision to support candidates from other parties, and has accused the alliance of being too dominated by the PS.\n\n## Socialist infighting and election of Martine Froger\n\nIn November 2022, the Socialist Party (PS) held a national congress, which was marked by infighting and divisions. The congress eventually elected Martine Froger as the party's new leader, who has been seen as a more left-wing and radical alternative to the party's previous leaders.\n\n## Socialist Party suspension\n\nIn December 2022, the NUPES suspended the Socialist Party (PS) from its ranks, following a dispute over the party's decision to support a candidate in a local election. The suspension was seen as a significant blow to the NUPES, and has raised questions about the alliance's future.\n\n# Members\n\nThe New Ecological and Social People's Union has several member parties, including:\n\n* Socialist Party (PS)\n* French Communist Party (PCF)\n* Europe Ecology – The Greens (EELV)\n* Radical Party of the Left (PRG)\n* La France Insoumise (LFI)\n* Pirate Party\n* New Deal\n* Movement of Progressives\n\n## Former members\n\n* Generation.s\n* En Commun\n\n# Candidates 2022\n\nThe NUPES presented a total of 566 candidates in the 2022 French legislative election.\n\n## Breakdown by constituency\n\nThe NUPES presented candidates in all 577 constituencies, with the following breakdown:\n\n* Metropolitan France: 512 candidates\n* Overseas departments and territories: 54 candidates\n\n## Dissident candidates\n\nSeveral dissident candidates from the NUPES's member parties ran against the alliance's official candidates, including several candidates from the PS and the PCF.\n\n# Ideology and platform\n\nThe New Ecological and Social People's Union is a left-wing alliance that advocates for a range of progressive policies, including:\n\n* Social justice and equality\n* Environmental protection and climate action\n* Democratic reform and participatory democracy\n* Economic equality and social welfare\n* Human rights and anti-discrimination\n\n# Electoral history\n\n## Legislative elections\n\n* 2022: 131 seats (22.7% of the total)\n\n# Reactions\n\nThe New Ecological and Social People's Union has been met with a range of reactions from across the political spectrum.\n\n## PS majority and social-democratic left\n\nThe NUPES has been seen as a significant development by the social-democratic left, which has been seeking to rebuild and reorganize after several years of decline. The alliance has been praised for its commitment to social justice and environmental protection.\n\n## PS minority and opposition\n\nHowever, not all members of the Socialist Party (PS) have been supportive of the NUPES. Some have criticized the alliance for being too dominated by the PS, and for not doing enough to promote the party's own policies and interests.\n\n## Extra-parliamentary left\n\nThe NUPES has also been met with skepticism by some on the extra-parliamentary left, who have criticized the alliance for being too focused on electoral politics and not enough on grassroots activism and social movement-building.\n\n## Presidential majority\n\nThe NUPES has been seen as a significant challenge by the presidential majority, which has been seeking to maintain its control of the legislature and to implement its own policies and agenda. The alliance has been criticized by some on the right for being too radical and too divided.\n\n# See also\n\n* Left-wing politics in France\n* Socialism in France\n* Environmentalism in France\n* French Communist Party\n* Socialist Party (France)\n* Europe Ecology – The Greens\n* La France Insoumise\n\n# Notes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"New_Ecological_and_Social_People's_Union\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Formation\n##Expansion\n##2022 French legislative election\n##Electoral results and aftermath\n##Election of René Pilato\n##Quatennens Affair\n##Bayou Affair\n##Tensions with the Communist Party\n##Socialist infighting and election of Martine Froger\n##Socialist Party suspension\n#Members\n##Former members\n#Candidates 2022\n##Breakdown by constituency\n##Dissident candidates\n#Ideology and platform\n#Electoral history\n##Legislative elections\n#Reactions\n##PS majority and social-democratic left\n##PS minority and opposition\n##Extra-parliamentary left\n##Presidential majority\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
