He is considered one of the most important figures in Afghan history, playing a crucial role in the country's relations with European powers and its internal development.\n\nBackground and rise to power\n---------------------------\n\nDost Mohammad Khan was born in 1793 in Kandahar, Afghanistan. He was a member of the Barakzai tribe, which had been a dominant force in Afghan politics for centuries. Dost Mohammad's family had a long history of involvement in Afghan politics, with his father, Payinda Khan, serving as a powerful tribal leader.\n\nDost Mohammad Khan's rise to power began in the early 19th century, when he became involved in the struggles for control of Afghanistan. In 1823, he seized power in Kabul, becoming the Emir of Afghanistan. His early years in power were marked by struggles against rival claimants to the throne and against the Sikh Empire, which had been expanding its territories in the region.\n\nEuropean influence in Afghanistan\n--------------------------------\n\nDuring Dost Mohammad Khan's reign, Afghanistan became increasingly drawn into the orbit of European powers. The British Empire, in particular, was expanding its influence in the region, and Dost Mohammad Khan saw the need to establish good relations with the British in order to counterbalance the growing power of the Sikh Empire.\n\nIn 1838, Dost Mohammad Khan negotiated a treaty with the British, which recognized his sovereignty over Afghanistan and provided for British support in the event of an attack by the Sikhs. However, the treaty also contained clauses that limited Afghan independence, and Dost Mohammad Khan soon became disillusioned with the agreement.\n\nWar with the Sikhs\n-----------------\n\nIn 1839, Dost Mohammad Khan launched a war against the Sikh Empire, seeking to expand his territories and assert his independence. The war was sparked by a dispute over the city of Peshawar, which was controlled by the Sikhs but claimed by the Afghans.\n\nThe war was a disaster for the Afghans, and Dost Mohammad Khan was forced to flee Kabul. The British, who had been supporting the Sikhs, installed a new ruler in Kabul, Shah Shuja Durrani. However, Shah Shuja Durrani's reign was short-lived, and he was eventually overthrown and killed.\n\nSecond reign\n------------\n\nDost Mohammad Khan regained power in Afghanistan in 1842, following a series of revolts against the British-backed government. He established a new government and set about rebuilding the country, which had been devastated by the wars with the Sikhs and the British.\n\n### Conquest of the Balkh Wilayat\n\nOne of Dost Mohammad Khan's first priorities was to reconquer the Balkh Wilayat, a region in northern Afghanistan that had been lost to the Sikhs during the war. In 1845, he launched a successful campaign against the Sikhs, and the Balkh Wilayat was returned to Afghan control.\n\n### Alliance with the British\n\nDespite his earlier conflicts with the British, Dost Mohammad Khan recognized the need to establish good relations with the British in order to counterbalance the growing power of the Sikh Empire. In 1855, he signed a new treaty with the British, which recognized Afghan independence and provided for British support in the event of an attack by the Sikhs.\n\n### Conquest of Herat and Death\n\nIn 1862, Dost Mohammad Khan launched a campaign against the city of Herat, which was controlled by a rival claimant to the throne. The campaign was successful, and Herat was returned to Afghan control. However, Dost Mohammad Khan died in 1863, before he could consolidate his gains.\n\nGallery\n--------\n\n* Portrait of Dost Mohammad Khan\n* Map of Afghanistan during Dost Mohammad Khan's reign\n* Image of the Balkh Wilayat\n* Image of the city of Herat\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* History of Afghanistan\n* Sikh Empire\n* British Empire\n* Barakzai dynasty\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nSources\n--------\n\n* [Insert sources]\n\nExternal links\n---------------\n\n* [Insert external links]", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Dost_Mohammad_Khan\" following this outline:\n\n#Background and rise to power\n#European influence in Afghanistan\n#War with the Sikhs\n#Second reign\n##Conquest of the Balkh Wilayat\n##Alliance with the British\n##Conquest of Herat and Death\n#Gallery\n#See also\n#References\n##Sources\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The storm formed in the western Atlantic Ocean and rapidly intensified into a hurricane, making landfall in the Bahamas and later in Florida. Nicole's strong winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surge caused widespread damage and disruptions, particularly in the Bahamas and parts of Florida.\n\n# Meteorological history\n\nHurricane Nicole originated from a tropical wave that emerged from the west coast of Africa on October 25, 2022. The wave moved westward across the Atlantic, gradually developing a closed circulation and convection. On November 2, the system was classified as a tropical depression, and by November 4, it had strengthened into Tropical Storm Nicole. Nicole continued to intensify, becoming a hurricane on November 5.\n\nAs Nicole moved northwestward, it encountered favorable environmental conditions, including warm ocean waters and low wind shear. The storm rapidly intensified, with its maximum sustained winds increasing from 70 mph (115 km/h) on November 5 to 120 mph (195 km/h) on November 7. Nicole's minimum central pressure dropped to 960 mbar (28.35 inHg) on November 7, making it a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.\n\n# Preparations\n\nAs Nicole approached the Bahamas and the southeastern United States, governments and emergency management officials took steps to prepare for the storm's potential impacts.\n\n## Bahamas\n\nThe Bahamian government issued a hurricane warning for the entire country, advising residents to seek shelter and stock up on supplies. The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) activated its emergency operations center and deployed personnel to assist with evacuations and relief efforts.\n\n## United States\n\n### Florida\n\nThe State of Florida declared a state of emergency, mobilizing resources and personnel to respond to the storm. Governor Ron DeSantis activated the Florida National Guard and deployed troops to support evacuation efforts and provide security. The Florida Department of Transportation suspended tolls on major highways to facilitate evacuations.\n\n### Neighboring states\n\nGeorgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina also took precautions, declaring states of emergency and mobilizing resources to respond to potential impacts from Nicole.\n\n# Impact\n\nHurricane Nicole brought significant impacts to the Caribbean and the southeastern United States.\n\n## Lesser Antilles\n\nNicole passed north of the Lesser Antilles, bringing tropical storm-force winds and heavy rainfall to several islands. The storm caused power outages and minor damage, but no fatalities were reported.\n\n## Greater Antilles\n\nNicole's outer rain bands brought heavy rainfall to Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, causing flash flooding and landslides. The storm's strong winds also caused power outages and minor damage.\n\n## Bahamas\n\nNicole made landfall in the Bahamas on November 7, bringing Category 3 winds and a storm surge of up to 10 feet (3 meters). The storm caused widespread damage, particularly on the islands of Grand Bahama and Abaco. The Bahamas National Emergency Management Agency reported that over 1,000 homes were damaged or destroyed, and several major roads were impassable.\n\n## United States\n\n### Florida\n\nNicole made landfall in Florida on November 8, bringing Category 1 winds and a storm surge of up to 6 feet (1.8 meters). The storm caused widespread power outages, with over 300,000 households losing electricity. The Florida Department of Transportation reported that several major highways were closed due to flooding, and several bridges were damaged.\n\n### Elsewhere\n\nNicole's outer rain bands brought heavy rainfall to Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina, causing flash flooding and minor damage. The storm's strong winds also caused power outages and minor damage.\n\n## Canada\n\nNicole's remnants brought heavy rainfall to parts of Quebec and Ontario, causing flash flooding and minor damage.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe aftermath of Hurricane Nicole saw widespread damage and disruptions, particularly in the Bahamas and parts of Florida.\n\nGovernments and emergency management officials worked to restore power, clear roads, and provide aid to affected residents. The Bahamian government established a relief fund to support affected residents, and the United States Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) deployed personnel to support relief efforts in Florida.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of Atlantic hurricanes\n* List of Category 3 Atlantic hurricanes\n\n# References\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)\n\n# External links\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Hurricane_Nicole_(2022)\" following this outline:\n\n#Meteorological history\n#Preparations\n##Bahamas\n##United States\n###Florida\n###Neighboring states\n#Impact\n##Lesser Antilles\n##Greater Antilles\n##Bahamas\n##United States\n###Florida\n###Elsewhere\n##Canada\n#Aftermath\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born on June 24, 1987, in Rosario, Argentina, Messi has consistently dominated the sport, winning numerous accolades and breaking records throughout his career.\n\nEarly Life\n-----------\n\nMessi was born to Jorge Messi, a steel factory worker, and Celia Cuccittini, a part-time cleaner. He grew up in a tight-knit family with two older brothers, Rodrigo and Matías, and a younger sister, María Sol. Messi's early life was marked by a passion for football, which was encouraged by his family. He began playing football at a young age, joining the local club Grandoli at the age of five.\n\nYouth Career\n------------\n\n### Newell's Old Boys (1995–2000)\n\nAt the age of eight, Messi joined Newell's Old Boys, a local club in Rosario. During his time at Newell's, Messi played for the club's youth team, where he quickly made a name for himself as a talented young player. In 1998, Messi was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency, which required him to undergo treatment. Despite this setback, Messi continued to excel on the pitch, leading Newell's to several youth tournament victories.\n\n### Barcelona (2000–2004)\n\nIn 2000, Messi's family moved to Barcelona, Spain, where he joined FC Barcelona's youth academy, La Masia.

The arrival of Luis Suárez and Neymar Jr. formed the deadly attacking trio MSN, which terrorized opposing defenses.

Messi's move to PSG marked a new chapter in his career, as he joined forces with other top players, including Kylian Mbappé and Neymar Jr.\n\n### Inter Miami (2023–present)\n\nIn July 2023, Messi joined Inter Miami on a three-year contract, marking a new chapter in his career in Major League Soccer.\n\nInternational Career\n-------------------\n\nMessi has been a key player for the Argentina national team, representing his country in numerous international tournaments.

He is a versatile player who can play in various positions, including as a winger, attacking midfielder, and striker. Messi's incredible dribbling skills and ability to beat defenders make him one of the most feared players in the world.\n\n### Tactical positioning\n\nMessi is often deployed as a left winger or attacking midfielder, where he can use his speed and skill to beat defenders and create scoring opportunities.

The election was triggered by the resignation of Nicola Sturgeon as leader of the SNP and First Minister of Scotland on February 15, 2023.\n\n#Background\n\nNicola Sturgeon had been the leader of the SNP and First Minister of Scotland since 2014. During her tenure, she had led the party to several election victories and had been a key figure in the Scottish independence movement. However, in February 2023, Sturgeon announced her resignation as leader of the SNP and First Minister of Scotland, citing personal reasons and a desire to spend more time with her family.\n\nThe resignation of Sturgeon triggered a leadership election, with several high-profile SNP politicians announcing their intention to stand. The election was seen as a crucial moment for the SNP and the Scottish independence movement, with the outcome likely to shape the future of Scottish politics.\n\n#Issues\n\nThe 2023 SNP leadership election was dominated by several key issues, including economics, independence, and gender recognition reform.\n\n##Economics\n\nThe SNP has traditionally been seen as a left-of-center party, and economic policy was a key issue in the leadership election. The candidates debated issues such as taxation, public spending, and the role of the state in the economy. Kate Forbes, one of the candidates, argued that the SNP should focus on reducing poverty and inequality, while Ash Regan, another candidate, argued that the party should prioritize economic growth and competitiveness.\n\n##Independence\n\nScottish independence was also a key issue in the leadership election. The SNP has long been committed to holding a second referendum on independence, and the candidates debated the best way to achieve this goal. Humza Yousaf, one of the candidates, argued that the SNP should prioritize building a broad coalition in favor of independence, while Kate Forbes argued that the party should focus on making the case for independence to those who were undecided.\n\n##Gender recognition reform\n\nGender recognition reform was also a contentious issue in the leadership election. The Scottish government had introduced a bill to reform the Gender Recognition Act, which would make it easier for transgender people to change their legal gender. However, the bill was opposed by some SNP politicians, who argued that it could have unintended consequences. The candidates debated the issue, with Ash Regan arguing that the SNP should prioritize the rights of women, while Humza Yousaf argued that the party should prioritize the rights of transgender people.\n\n#Campaign\n\nThe campaign for the SNP leadership election was marked by a series of hustings and debates, as well as a row about membership numbers.\n\n##Nomination period\n\nThe nomination period for the leadership election opened on February 22, 2023, and closed on March 1, 2023. During this time, several high-profile SNP politicians announced their intention to stand, including Kate Forbes, Ash Regan, and Humza Yousaf.\n\n##Kate Forbes\n\nKate Forbes, the Finance Secretary, was one of the first candidates to announce her intention to stand. She launched her campaign on February 22, 2023, and was seen as one of the front-runners from the start. Forbes argued that she had the experience and the vision to lead the SNP and the Scottish government.\n\n##Ash Regan\n\nAsh Regan, a former Community Safety Minister, announced her intention to stand on February 24, 2023. Regan argued that she had a unique perspective as a politician from a working-class background, and that she could connect with voters who felt disillusioned with politics.\n\n##Humza Yousaf\n\nHumza Yousaf, the Health Secretary, announced his intention to stand on February 25, 2023. Yousaf argued that he had the passion and the energy to lead the SNP and the Scottish government, and that he could build a broad coalition in favor of independence.\n\n##Hustings\n\nThe candidates took part in a series of hustings, which were organized by the SNP and by external organizations such as the BBC. The hustings were seen as an opportunity for the candidates to debate the issues and to make their case to SNP members.\n\n##Row about membership numbers\n\nThere was a row about membership numbers during the campaign, with some candidates accusing the SNP of failing to provide accurate figures. The row centered on the question of whether the SNP had lost members in the months leading up to the leadership election. The SNP eventually released figures showing that the party had around 72,000 members, but the row continued to dominate the campaign.\n\n#Election process\n\nThe election process was overseen by the SNP's National Executive Committee (NEC). The NEC set the rules for the election, including the nomination period, the hustings, and the voting system.\n\n#Candidates\n\nThere were three candidates in the SNP leadership election.\n\n##Declared\n\n* Kate Forbes\n* Ash Regan\n* Humza Yousaf\n\n##Declined\n\nSeveral high-profile SNP politicians declined to stand, including Angus Robertson, the Constitution Secretary, and John Swinney, the Deputy First Minister.\n\n#Endorsements\n\nThe candidates received endorsements from various SNP politicians and organizations.\n\n##Kate Forbes\n\nForbes was endorsed by several high-profile SNP politicians, including Nicola Sturgeon, who backed her as her preferred successor.\n\n##Ash Regan\n\nRegan was endorsed by several SNP politicians, including Kenny MacAskill, the former Justice Secretary.\n\n##Humza Yousaf\n\nYousaf was endorsed by several SNP politicians, including Shona Robison, the former Health Secretary.\n\n##Declined to endorse\n\nSome SNP politicians declined to endorse any of the candidates, including Alex Salmond, the former First Minister, who argued that the party should focus on rebuilding and renewing itself.\n\n#Debates\n\nThe candidates took part in several debates, which were organized by the SNP and by external organizations such as the BBC. The debates were seen as an opportunity for the candidates to debate the issues and to make their case to SNP members.\n\n#Hustings\n\nThe candidates took part in several hustings, which were organized by the SNP and by external organizations. The hustings were seen as an opportunity for the candidates to debate the issues and to make their case to SNP members.\n\n#Opinion polling\n\nThere was opinion polling during the campaign, which showed that Humza Yousaf was the front-runner.\n\n##SNP membership\n\nA poll of SNP members found that Yousaf was the most popular candidate, with 32% of the vote. Forbes was second, with 25%, while Regan was third, with 21%.\n\n##2021 SNP voters\n\nA poll of SNP voters from the 2021 Scottish Parliament election found that Yousaf was the most popular candidate, with 35% of the vote. Forbes was second, with 26%, while Regan was third, with 20%.\n\n##Scottish public\n\nA poll of the Scottish public found that Yousaf was the most popular candidate, with 28% of the vote. Forbes was second, with 22%, while Regan was third, with 18%.\n\n#Results\n\nThe results of the election were announced on March 27, 2023. Humza Yousaf was elected as the new leader of the SNP, with 52.1% of the vote in the final round.\n\n##Preference votes by candidate\n\n* Humza Yousaf: 52.1%\n* Kate Forbes: 47.9%\n\n#Aftermath\n\nThe election of Humza Yousaf as the new leader of the SNP was seen as a significant moment for the party and for Scottish politics.

The attack was widely condemned, and it raised concerns about the safety of public figures and the impact of online hate speech.\n\n#Background\n\nSalman Rushdie is a renowned author known for his novels, essays, and public commentary. Born in India in 1947, Rushdie moved to the United Kingdom in the 1960s and later became a British citizen. His writing often explores themes of identity, culture, and politics, and he has been recognized with numerous literary awards. However, Rushdie's work has also been the subject of controversy, particularly his novel \"The Satanic Verses,\" which was published in 1988 and sparked widespread protests and calls for his death.\n\nThe controversy surrounding \"The Satanic Verses\" led to a fatwa being issued against Rushdie by Ayatollah Khomeini, the Supreme Leader of Iran, in 1989. The fatwa called for Rushdie's death, and it led to a prolonged period of threats and violence against the author.

The 2023 Royal Rumble was the 36th event in the chronology and the first to be held at the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas.\n\n## Storylines\nThe event featured a series of matches that were the result of feuds and storylines that had been building on WWE's television shows, Monday Night Raw and Friday Night SmackDown. One of the main storylines heading into the event was the rivalry between Roman Reigns and Kevin Owens, who were set to face each other for the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship.\n\n# Event\n\n## Preliminary matches\nThe event kicked off with a series of preliminary matches, including a match between Bianca Belair and Alexa Bliss for the Raw Women's Championship.

The league operated from 1913 to 1941 and was one of the prominent regional football competitions in the state during its time.\n\n#History\n\nThe Faithful & District Football Association was formed in 1913, with five founding clubs: Faithful Creek, Longwood, Creighton's Creek, Murchison, and Rushworth. The league was established to provide a competitive platform for local football clubs in the Faithful Creek area. Over the years, the association underwent several changes, including the addition of new clubs, changes in the league's structure, and the introduction of new competitions.\n\nDuring its early years, the association faced several challenges, including the impact of World War I on player numbers and the difficulty of securing suitable grounds for matches. However, the league persevered and continued to grow, with the addition of new clubs and the establishment of a junior competition.\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, the Faithful & District Football Association experienced a period of significant growth and success. The league attracted top players from around the region, and the standard of competition improved dramatically. The association also established a strong reputation for sportsmanship and fair play, with a focus on developing young players and promoting the values of the game.\n\nDespite its success, the Faithful & District Football Association faced significant challenges during the 1930s, including the impact of the Great Depression on local communities and the loss of players to larger leagues. The association also struggled to maintain its competitiveness, with several clubs experiencing financial difficulties and player shortages.\n\nIn 1941, the Faithful & District Football Association merged with the nearby Euroa Football League to form the Euroa & District Football Association. The merger marked the end of the Faithful & District Football Association as a separate entity, although many of its clubs continued to compete in the new league.\n\n#Football Clubs\n\nThe Faithful & District Football Association was home to several clubs during its existence, including:\n\n* Faithful Creek Football Club: One of the founding clubs of the association, Faithful Creek was a dominant force in the league during its early years.\n* Longwood Football Club: Another founding club, Longwood was known for its strong junior development programs and produced several top players during its time in the association.\n* Creighton's Creek Football Club: Creighton's Creek was a small but competitive club that punched above its weight in the league, with several successful seasons during the 1920s and 1930s.\n* Murchison Football Club: Murchison was one of the stronger clubs in the association, with several premiership wins during its time in the league.\n* Rushworth Football Club: Rushworth was a founding club of the association and was known for its strong rivalry with neighboring clubs.\n* Nagambie Football Club: Nagambie joined the association in the 1920s and quickly established itself as a competitive force in the league.\n* Tatura Football Club: Tatura joined the association in the 1930s and produced several top players during its time in the league.\n\n#Football Grand Finals\n\nThe Faithful & District Football Association held several grand finals during its existence, with the following clubs emerging as premiers:\n\n* 1913: Faithful Creek\n* 1914: Longwood\n* 1915: Creighton's Creek\n* 1916: Murchison\n* 1917: Rushworth\n* 1918: Faithful Creek\n* 1919: Longwood\n* 1920: Creighton's Creek\n* 1921: Murchison\n* 1922: Nagambie\n* 1923: Faithful Creek\n* 1924: Longwood\n* 1925: Creighton's Creek\n* 1926: Murchison\n* 1927: Rushworth\n* 1928: Nagambie\n* 1929: Faithful Creek\n* 1930: Longwood\n* 1931: Creighton's Creek\n* 1932: Murchison\n* 1933: Nagambie\n* 1934: Faithful Creek\n* 1935: Rushworth\n* 1936: Longwood\n* 1937: Creighton's Creek\n* 1938: Murchison\n* 1939: Nagambie\n* 1940: Faithful Creek\n* 1941: Longwood\n\n#O'Loan Cup\n\nThe O'Loan Cup was a competition held by the Faithful & District Football Association from 1925 to 1941.

The following lists aim to provide a comprehensive overview of feature films that include LGBT characters, covering a wide range of genres, styles, and time periods.\n\n# Early years (1900s-1960s)\n\n## Silent era\n\nDuring the silent era, LGBT characters were often portrayed in a subtle and coded manner, due to the social and cultural norms of the time. Films such as \"A Florida Enchantment\" (1914) and \"Pandora's Box\" (1929) featured characters with same-sex attractions, but these were often depicted in a way that was not overtly explicit.\n\n## Pre-Code era\n\nThe pre-Code era saw a slight increase in the representation of LGBT characters, with films such as \"Call Her Savage\" (1932) and \"Design for Living\" (1933) featuring characters with same-sex relationships. However, these depictions were often subject to censorship and were not always explicit.\n\n## Post-Code era\n\nThe post-Code era saw a significant decline in the representation of LGBT characters, as the Hays Code prohibited the depiction of \"sex perversion\" on screen. Films such as \"Rebel Without a Cause\" (1955) and \"Tea and Sympathy\" (1956) featured characters with same-sex attractions, but these were often depicted in a way that was subtle and coded.\n\n# New Wave and counterculture (1960s-1970s)\n\n## European art house\n\nThe European art house movement saw a significant increase in the representation of LGBT characters, with films such as \"The Servant\" (1963) and \"The Damned\" (1969) featuring characters with same-sex relationships. These films often explored themes of identity, alienation, and social critique.\n\n## American underground\n\nThe American underground movement saw the emergence of films such as \"Scorpio Rising\" (1964) and \"Flesh\" (1968), which featured explicit depictions of same-sex relationships and explored themes of identity, desire, and rebellion.\n\n## Mainstream cinema\n\nThe mainstream cinema of the 1960s and 1970s saw a gradual increase in the representation of LGBT characters, with films such as \"The Boys in the Band\" (1970) and \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\" (1971) featuring characters with same-sex relationships. These films often explored themes of identity, community, and social critique.\n\n# AIDS epidemic and queer cinema (1980s-1990s)\n\n## AIDS epidemic\n\nThe AIDS epidemic had a significant impact on the representation of LGBT characters in film, with films such as \"Parting Glances\" (1986) and \"Longtime Companion\" (1989) exploring themes of identity, community, and mortality.\n\n## Queer cinema\n\nThe queer cinema movement saw the emergence of films such as \"Desert Hearts\" (1985) and \"My Own Private Idaho\" (1991), which featured explicit depictions of same-sex relationships and explored themes of identity, desire, and rebellion.\n\n## Mainstream cinema\n\nThe mainstream cinema of the 1980s and 1990s saw a gradual increase in the representation of LGBT characters, with films such as \"Philadelphia\" (1993) and \"The Birdcage\" (1996) featuring characters with same-sex relationships. These films often explored themes of identity, community, and social critique.\n\n# Contemporary cinema (2000s-present)\n\n## LGBTQ+ cinema\n\nThe LGBTQ+ cinema movement has seen the emergence of films such as \"Brokeback Mountain\" (2005) and \"Moonlight\" (2016), which feature explicit depictions of same-sex relationships and explore themes of identity, desire, and rebellion.\n\n## Mainstream cinema\n\nThe mainstream cinema of the 2000s and 2010s has seen a significant increase in the representation of LGBT characters, with films such as \"The Kids Are All Right\" (2010) and \"Love, Simon\" (2018) featuring characters with same-sex relationships. These films often explore themes of identity, community, and social critique.\n\n## Trans representation\n\nThe representation of trans characters in film has seen a significant increase in recent years, with films such as \"Transamerica\" (2005) and \"The Danish Girl\" (2015) featuring trans characters and exploring themes of identity, community, and social critique.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of LGBT-related films\n* List of LGBT-related television shows\n* List of LGBT characters in film and television\n* Queer cinema\n* LGBT representation in media", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Lists_of_feature_films_with_LGBT_characters\" following this outline:\n\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

With a career spanning over six decades, Țăranu has established himself as a leading figure in Romanian musical life, known for his eclectic style, which encompasses a wide range of influences, from neoclassicism to postmodernism and historicism.\n\n# Biography\n\n## Early life and neoclassical debut\n\nBorn on June 20, 1934, in Cluj-Napoca, Romania, Cornel Țăranu began his musical studies at an early age. He pursued his passion for music at the Gheorghe Dima Music Academy in Cluj-Napoca, where he studied composition with the prominent Romanian composer, Sigismund Toduță. During his time at the academy, Țăranu developed a strong affinity for neoclassicism, which would later become a defining feature of his compositional style. His early works, such as the Piano Sonata (1956) and the String Quartet (1958), showcased his mastery of classical forms and his ability to craft elegant, refined melodies.\n\n## Paris studies and Ars Nova\n\nIn the early 1960s, Țăranu received a scholarship to pursue further studies at the Paris Conservatory, where he was exposed to the avant-garde movements of the time. Under the guidance of Olivier Messiaen and Pierre Boulez, Țăranu became acquainted with the principles of serialism and the works of the Second Viennese School. This period marked a significant turning point in his compositional career, as he began to experiment with new techniques and incorporate elements of aleatoric music into his works. The influence of the Ars Nova movement, led by Boulez and Pierre Schaeffer, can be seen in Țăranu's compositions from this period, such as the \"Préludes\" for piano (1964) and the \"Symphony No. 1\" (1965).\n\n## Postmodernism and historicism\n\nThe 1970s and 1980s saw a shift in Țăranu's compositional style, as he began to explore postmodernist and historicist tendencies. His music from this period is characterized by a blend of modernist techniques and references to historical styles, such as baroque and classical music. Works like the \"Concerto for Piano and Orchestra\" (1973) and the \"Sinfonia da Requiem\" (1981) demonstrate Țăranu's ability to synthesize disparate elements into a cohesive and distinctive sound. This eclecticism has become a hallmark of his compositional approach, allowing him to navigate multiple styles and genres with ease.\n\n## Old age\n\nIn recent years, Țăranu has continued to compose music, albeit at a slower pace. His later works, such as the \"String Quartet No. 3\" (2005) and the \"Piano Sonata No. 2\" (2010), showcase his ongoing commitment to innovation and artistic growth. Despite his advanced age, Țăranu remains an active figure in Romanian musical life, serving as a mentor and inspiration to younger generations of composers.\n\n# Selected works\n\n* Piano Sonata (1956)\n* String Quartet (1958)\n* Préludes for piano (1964)\n* Symphony No. 1 (1965)\n* Concerto for Piano and Orchestra (1973)\n* Sinfonia da Requiem (1981)\n* String Quartet No. 3 (2005)\n* Piano Sonata No. 2 (2010)\n\n# References\n\n# External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Cornel_Țăranu\" following this outline:\n\n#Biography\n##Early life and neoclassical debut\n##Paris studies and Ars Nova\n##Postmodernism and historicism\n##Old age\n#Selected works\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He was known for his work on various film and television projects, as well as his commentary on international politics and social issues. Lira's life and career were marked by a mix of creative pursuits and personal struggles, which ultimately led to his tragic death.\n\n# Early life\n\nGonzalo Lira was born on February 20, 1968, in Burbank, California, to Chilean parents. His family moved to Chile when he was a child, and he spent his early years in the country. Lira's parents were both intellectuals and artists, and they encouraged his creative pursuits from an early age.\n\nLira's family returned to the United States when he was a teenager, and he attended high school in California. He developed an interest in filmmaking and writing during this time, and he began making short films and writing screenplays.\n\nAfter high school, Lira attended the University of California, Berkeley, where he studied English literature and creative writing. He became involved in the university's film community and began making short films and collaborating with other filmmakers.\n\n# Career\n\nLira's career in film and television began in the 1990s, when he started working as a writer and producer on various projects. He worked on television shows, films, and documentaries, and he collaborated with a range of directors and producers.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Lira began to focus more on his own projects, and he started making short films and documentaries. His work explored themes of identity, culture, and social justice, and he became known for his unique perspective and style.\n\nLira also worked as a commentator and journalist, writing articles and blog posts on international politics and social issues. He was particularly interested in Latin American politics and culture, and he wrote extensively on these topics.\n\nIn 2014, Lira moved to Ukraine, where he began working on a new film project. He became involved in the country's film community and began collaborating with local filmmakers.\n\n# Arrest and prosecution\n\nIn March 2022, Lira was arrested by Russian forces in Kharkiv, Ukraine. He was accused of spreading disinformation and propaganda about the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and he was charged with treason.\n\nLira's arrest was widely condemned by human rights organizations and journalists, who argued that he was being targeted for his critical views of the Russian government.\n\nLira was held in detention for several weeks, during which time he was subjected to interrogation and intimidation.

The will is a legal document that outlines the deceased person's wishes regarding the distribution of their assets, debts, and other responsibilities. This article provides an overview of the key aspects of testate succession in South African law, including freedom of testation, testamentary capacity, the formalities for executing a will, and the effects of a will on the rights of heirs, legatees, and fiduciaries.\n\n# Freedom of Testation\n\nFreedom of testation is the principle that allows a person to distribute their estate as they wish, subject to certain limitations and restrictions. In South Africa, the freedom of testation is enshrined in the common law and is subject to certain statutory limitations.\n\n## Limitations\n\nThere are several limitations to the freedom of testation in South African law. These limitations are designed to protect the rights of certain individuals, such as the deceased person's spouse and children, and to ensure that the estate is distributed in a fair and just manner.\n\n### Illegal Dispositions and Those Against Public Policy\n\nA disposition in a will that is illegal or against public policy is null and void. For example, a disposition that promotes or supports a crime, such as murder or theft, is invalid.\n\n### Subdivision of Agricultural Land\n\nThe subdivision of agricultural land is subject to certain restrictions under the Subdivision of Agricultural Land Act. This Act requires that any subdivision of agricultural land must be approved by the Minister of Agriculture.\n\n### Subdivision of Mineral Rights\n\nThe subdivision of mineral rights is subject to certain restrictions under the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act.

These houses were constructed by the earliest European settlers, primarily English Puritans, who arrived in the New World in the 17th century. The First Period houses in Massachusetts are significant not only for their historical value but also for their architectural style, which reflects the cultural and social influences of the time.\n\n#Legend\n\nThe term \"First Period\" was coined by architectural historian Abbott Lowell Cummings in his 1979 book \"The Framed Houses of Massachusetts Bay, 1625-1725.\" Cummings used this term to describe the earliest houses built in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, which were characterized by a specific set of architectural features. According to Cummings, the First Period houses in Massachusetts can be dated from approximately 1625 to 1725. However, this article will focus specifically on the First Period houses built between 1660 and 1679.\n\n#1660–1670\n\nDuring this period, the Massachusetts Bay Colony was experiencing significant growth and development. The population was increasing, and new towns were being established. As a result, there was a growing need for housing. The First Period houses built during this time were primarily constructed by English Puritans who had arrived in the New World seeking religious freedom.\n\n## Architecture\n\nThe First Period houses built between 1660 and 1670 were characterized by several distinct architectural features. These houses were typically one to two stories high, with a central chimney and a steeply pitched roof. The exterior walls were often constructed using wood framing, with clapboard or shingle siding. The windows were typically small and multi-paned, with shutters to provide additional protection from the elements.\n\n## Examples\n\nSeveral examples of First Period houses built between 1660 and 1670 can be found in Massachusetts. The Fairbanks House, built in 1636, is one of the oldest surviving houses in the United States and is believed to be the oldest surviving timber-framed house in North America. The Whipple House, built in 1670, is another example of a First Period house that still stands today. This house features a central chimney and a steeply pitched roof, characteristic of the architectural style of the time.\n\n#1671–1679\n\nDuring this period, the Massachusetts Bay Colony continued to grow and develop.

The John Balch House, built in 1679, is one of the oldest surviving houses in Beverly, Massachusetts. This house features a central chimney and a steeply pitched roof, characteristic of the architectural style of the time.

The platform allows users to share text posts, similar to Twitter, and is designed to facilitate real-time discussions and community engagement.\n\n#History\n\n##Predecessor\n\nThreads is not the first attempt by Instagram to create a text-based social networking service. In 2019, the company launched a feature called \"Threads\" as a companion app to Instagram, allowing users to share behind-the-scenes content with their closest friends. However, the feature failed to gain significant traction and was eventually shut down.\n\n##Development and announcement\n\nThe development of the new Threads platform began in 2022, with a team of engineers and designers from Instagram working on the project. The platform was designed to address the growing demand for real-time discussions and community engagement on social media. In July 2023, Meta Platforms announced the launch of Threads, positioning it as a competitor to Twitter.\n\n##Launch\n\nThreads was launched on July 5, 2023, with a phased rollout to users in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada. The platform was initially available on both desktop and mobile devices, with a user interface designed to be intuitive and easy to use.\n\n#Appearance and features\n\n##Possibility of open interoperability\n\nOne of the key features of Threads is its potential for open interoperability with other social media platforms. The company has announced plans to make the platform's API available to developers, allowing them to build third-party apps and integrations. This move could potentially allow users to share content across multiple platforms, increasing the reach and engagement of their posts.\n\n##Account integration with Instagram\n\nThreads allows users to link their Instagram account to the platform, enabling them to share content and connect with their Instagram followers. The integration also allows users to share their Threads posts directly to Instagram, increasing their reach and engagement.\n\n##Device compatibility\n\nThreads is available on a range of devices, including desktop computers, laptops, smartphones, and tablets. The platform is designed to be mobile-first, with a user interface optimized for smaller screens.\n\n##Censorship attempts\n\nIn the months following its launch, Threads faced criticism for its handling of censorship and moderation. The platform's algorithms were accused of suppressing certain types of content, including posts from marginalized communities. In response, the company announced plans to revise its moderation policies and increase transparency around its content moderation practices.\n\n##Advertising\n\nThreads has faced criticism for its approach to advertising, with some users expressing concerns about the platform's use of personal data for targeted ads. The company has announced plans to introduce a range of ad formats, including sponsored posts and display ads.\n\n#Userbase\n\n##Decline in the months after launch\n\nIn the months following its launch, Threads experienced a decline in user engagement and activity. The platform's user base grew rapidly in the first few weeks after launch, but then began to decline as users lost interest or became frustrated with the platform's limitations.\n\n##Popularity in Taiwan\n\nDespite declining user engagement in other regions, Threads has remained popular in Taiwan, where it has become a major platform for real-time discussions and community engagement. The platform's popularity in Taiwan has been driven by its adoption by local influencers and content creators.\n\n#Responses\n\n##Intellectual property dispute\n\nIn the months following its launch, Threads faced an intellectual property dispute with a rival social media platform. The dispute centered on allegations that Threads had infringed on the rival platform's patents and trademarks.\n\n##Data privacy\n\nThreads has faced criticism for its handling of user data, with some users expressing concerns about the platform's use of personal data for targeted ads. The company has announced plans to increase transparency around its data collection practices and provide users with more control over their data.\n\n##State media\n\nThreads has faced criticism from state media outlets in several countries, which have accused the platform of promoting Western values and ideologies. The company has denied these allegations, stating that it is committed to providing a neutral and impartial platform for users.\n\n##Imitating other platforms\n\nThreads has faced criticism for imitating features and functionality from other social media platforms. The company has denied these allegations, stating that it is committed to innovation and providing users with unique and engaging features.\n\n#See also\n\n* Instagram\n* Meta Platforms\n* Twitter\n* Social media\n* Microblogging\n\n#References\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)\n\n#Further reading\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)\n\n#External links\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Threads_(social_network)\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Predecessor\n##Development and announcement\n##Launch\n#Appearance and features\n##Possibility of open interoperability\n##Account integration with Instagram\n##Device compatibility\n##Censorship attempts\n##Advertising\n#Userbase\n##Decline in the months after launch\n##Popularity in Taiwan\n#Responses\n##Intellectual property dispute\n##Data privacy\n##State media\n##Imitating other platforms\n#See also\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Movie\n==========================\n\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie is a 1993 American science fantasy comedy film directed by Rocky Morton and Annabel Jankel, and produced by Lightmotive, Allied Filmmakers, and Nintendo. The film is loosely based on the popular Super Mario video game series created by the Japanese video game designer, Shigeru Miyamoto. The movie follows the adventures of two brothers, Mario and Luigi, who are transported to a dystopian parallel universe where they must rescue a princess and save the world from the evil Bowser.\n\nPlot\n-----\n\nThe film begins with a narration explaining that the universe is composed of multiple parallel dimensions, and that the city of Dinohattan is a dystopian world that exists in a parallel universe to our own. In Dinohattan, the evil King Koopa, also known as Bowser, has taken over the city and rules with an iron fist. Meanwhile, in our world, the two brothers, Mario (Bob Hoskins) and Luigi (John Leguizamo), are plumbers who are struggling to make a living.\n\nOne day, while working on a job, the brothers meet a young woman named Daisy (Samantha Mathis), who is on the run from King Koopa's henchmen. Unbeknownst to the brothers, Daisy is actually a princess from Dinohattan who has been sent to our world to escape King Koopa's wrath. The brothers soon find themselves transported to Dinohattan, where they must navigate a strange and unfamiliar world.\n\nUpon their arrival, the brothers are arrested by King Koopa's henchmen and taken to the palace. However, they soon escape and embark on a quest to rescue Princess Daisy and save the world from King Koopa's evil clutches. Along the way, they meet a group of rebels who are fighting against King Koopa's regime, and they join forces to defeat the evil king.\n\nVoice cast\n------------\n\n* Bob Hoskins as Mario\n* John Leguizamo as Luigi\n* Dennis Hopper as King Koopa\n* Samantha Mathis as Princess Daisy\n* Fisher Stevens as Iggy\n* Richard Edson as Spike\n* Fiona Shaw as Queen Lena\n\nProduction\n------------\n\n### Development\n\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie was in development for several years before its release in 1993. The film was originally intended to be a more faithful adaptation of the Super Mario video game series, but the script underwent significant changes during production.\n\n### Writing\n\nThe screenplay was written by Parker Bennett, Terry Runté, and Ed Solomon. The writers drew inspiration from the video game series, but they also added their own unique twists and ideas to the story.\n\n### Casting\n\nThe casting process for the film was extensive, with several actors being considered for the lead roles. Bob Hoskins was ultimately cast as Mario, while John Leguizamo was cast as Luigi. Dennis Hopper was cast as King Koopa, and Samantha Mathis was cast as Princess Daisy.\n\n### Animation and design\n\nThe film's animation and design were overseen by the visual effects company, Industrial Light & Magic.

The path is characterized by its unique feature of connecting ancient towers, known as \"nuraghi,\" which date back to the Nuragic civilization that flourished on the island from the 18th to the 1st century BC.\n\n# History\n\nThe Nuragic civilization built these towers for defensive purposes, as they were strategically located on hills and mountains to provide a clear view of the surrounding area. The towers were also used for ceremonial and ritual purposes. Over time, the nuraghi were abandoned and left to ruins, but many have survived to this day.\n\nIn the 1990s, a group of Sardinian hikers and historians came together to create the Path of 100 Towers, with the goal of promoting tourism and preserving the island's cultural heritage. The path was designed to connect many of the nuraghi, as well as other historical sites and natural attractions.\n\n# Trekking routes\n\nThe Path of 100 Towers is a network of trekking routes that spans over 200 kilometers, offering a range of hiking options for all levels of experience. The path is divided into several sections, each with its own unique characteristics and attractions.\n\nThe most popular section of the path is the \"Nuragic Trail,\" which connects 15 nuraghi and takes hikers through some of the island's most stunning landscapes. The trail is approximately 30 kilometers long and takes around 2-3 days to complete.\n\nAnother popular section of the path is the \"Coastal Trail,\" which runs along the island's coastline and offers breathtaking views of the Mediterranean Sea. The trail is approximately 20 kilometers long and takes around 1-2 days to complete.\n\n# Towers\n\n## Main towers\n\nSome of the most notable nuraghi along the Path of 100 Towers include:\n\n* Nuraghe Su Nuraxi, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the best-preserved nuraghi on the island\n* Nuraghe Santu Antine, a complex of several nuraghi that dates back to the 16th century BC\n* Nuraghe Palmavera, a nuraghe that features a unique combination of defensive and ceremonial structures\n\nThese nuraghi offer a glimpse into the lives of the Nuragic people and provide a unique perspective on the island's history and culture.\n\n# Flora and Fauna\n\nThe island of Sardinia is home to a unique and diverse range of flora and fauna.\n\n## Mediterranean scrub\n\nThe island's interior is characterized by Mediterranean scrub, a type of vegetation that is adapted to the dry and hot conditions of the Mediterranean climate. The scrub is dominated by plants such as rosemary, thyme, and juniper, which are perfectly adapted to the island's rugged terrain.\n\n## Lagoon\n\nThe island's coastline is home to several lagoons, which provide a habitat for a wide range of wildlife. The lagoons are home to birds such as flamingos, egrets, and herons, as well as fish and shellfish.\n\n# Books\n\nSeveral books have been written about the Path of 100 Towers and the island of Sardinia. Some of the most notable include:\n\n* \"The Nuragic Civilization\" by Giovanni Lilliu, a comprehensive guide to the Nuragic civilization and its history\n* \"Sardinia: A Travel Guide\" by Lonely Planet, a guide to the island's attractions and activities\n* \"The Path of 100 Towers\" by Antonio Murineddu, a guide to the trekking routes and historical sites along the path\n\n# Curiosities\n\nThe Path of 100 Towers is home to several curiosities and legends. One of the most famous is the legend of the \"Fairy Rings,\" which are circular stone structures that are believed to have been built by the Nuragic people.\n\nAnother curiosity is the \"Tomba dei Giganti,\" a giant's tomb that is believed to date back to the Nuragic civilization.\n\n# Similar treks\n\nThe Path of 100 Towers is similar to other trekking routes in the Mediterranean region, such as the GR20 in Corsica and the Camino de Santiago in Spain. These routes offer a similar combination of natural beauty and cultural heritage.\n\n# See also\n\n* Nuragic civilization\n* Sardinia\n* Trekking\n* Hiking\n* Mediterranean Sea\n\n# Gallery\n\n[Insert images of the Path of 100 Towers, nuraghi, and Sardinian landscapes]\n\n# References\n\n[None]\n\n# External links\n\n* Official website of the Path of 100 Towers\n* Sardinia Tourism Board\n* Lonely Planet Sardinia\n* Nuragic Civilization Museum", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Path_of_100_Towers_(Sardinia)\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n#Trekking routes\n#Towers\n##Main towers\n#Flora and Fauna\n##Mediterranean scrub\n##Lagoon\n#Books\n#Curiosities\n#Similar treks\n#See also\n#Gallery\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The film is a prequel to the Predator franchise and the fifth installment overall. It stars Amber Midthunder, Dakota Beavers, Stormee Kipp, Michelle Thrush, and Julian Black Antelope.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe film takes place in the early 18th century, in the Comanche Nation, and follows the story of Naru, a young and ambitious Comanche hunter. Naru is determined to prove herself as a skilled hunter and warrior, but her efforts are constantly thwarted by her brother, Taabe, and the rest of the tribe, who see her as a woman and not a hunter.\n\nWhen a series of strange and gruesome attacks occur, Naru sets out to track down the culprit, which she soon discovers is a technologically advanced alien creature, known as the Predator. As Naru navigates the dangers of the wilderness and the Predator's deadly technology, she must also confront her own identity and the traditions of her tribe.\n\n# Cast\n\n* Amber Midthunder as Naru\n* Dakota Beavers as Taabe\n* Stormee Kipp as Wasape\n* Michelle Thrush as Aruka\n* Julian Black Antelope as Chief Kehetu\n* Stefany Mathias as Kuksi\n\n# Production\n\n## Development and casting\n\nThe film was first announced in 2016, with Shane Black set to direct and write the script. However, due to creative differences, Black left the project, and Dan Trachtenberg was brought on board to direct. Trachtenberg worked with Patrick Aison to develop the script, which was heavily influenced by the Comanche culture and the early 18th-century American wilderness.\n\nThe casting process was extensive, with the filmmakers seeking out Native American actors to play the lead roles. Amber Midthunder was cast as Naru, and Dakota Beavers was cast as Taabe.

The tournament was organized by the World Chess Federation (FIDE) to determine the challenger for the 2023 World Chess Championship.\n\n# Participants\n\nThe Candidates Tournament 2022 featured eight of the world's top chess players, each with a unique qualification story.\n\n## Qualification of Radjabov\n\nTeimour Radjabov, the Azerbaijani grandmaster, qualified for the tournament as the runner-up of the 2020-2021 FIDE Grand Prix Series. Radjabov, a former child prodigy, had a remarkable performance in the Grand Prix, finishing second behind Alexander Grischuk.\n\n## Disqualification of Karjakin\n\nSergey Karjakin, the Russian grandmaster and 2016 World Chess Championship runner-up, was initially qualified for the tournament as the loser of the 2021 World Chess Championship match against Magnus Carlsen. However, due to his support for the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Karjakin was banned from participating in FIDE events for six months. As a result, his spot in the Candidates Tournament was taken by Radjabov.\n\n## Qualification of Ding Liren\n\nDing Liren, the Chinese grandmaster, qualified for the tournament as the winner of the 2020-2021 FIDE Grand Prix Series. Ding, the world's number two ranked player at the time, dominated the Grand Prix, winning two of the three events and accumulating an impressive 23 points.\n\n# Organization\n\nThe Candidates Tournament 2022 was organized by FIDE, with the assistance of the Spanish Chess Federation.\n\n## Regulations\n\nThe tournament was a 14-round round-robin, with each player facing every other player once. The time control was 100 minutes for the first 40 moves, followed by 50 minutes for the next 20 moves, and then 15 minutes for the rest of the game, with a 30-second increment per move.

These gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, trap heat from the sun, leading to a rise in global temperatures. The effects of climate change are far-reaching and varied, impacting not only the environment but also human societies and economies.\n\nChanges in Temperature\n\nOne of the most obvious effects of climate change is the increase in global temperatures. The average global temperature has risen by about 1°C since the late 19th century, and the 20 warmest years on record have all occurred since 1981. This warming is not limited to the air; the oceans have also been warming, with the top 700 meters of the ocean showing a temperature increase of about 0.7°C since 1969.\n\nWeather\n\nClimate change is also affecting weather patterns around the world. This includes changes in precipitation, extreme weather events, and weather-related disasters.\n\n### Heat Waves and Temperature Extremes\n\nHeat waves are becoming more frequent and prolonged, leading to increased mortality and health problems, especially for vulnerable populations such as the elderly and young children. Temperature extremes, including both hot and cold snaps, are also becoming more common, leading to increased energy consumption and strain on infrastructure.\n\n### Rain\n\nClimate change is altering precipitation patterns, leading to more frequent and intense heavy rainfall events in some areas, and droughts in others. This can have significant impacts on agriculture, water resources, and human settlements.\n\n### Extreme Storms\n\nExtreme storms, including hurricanes, typhoons, and blizzards, are becoming more frequent and intense, leading to increased damage and disruption to human societies. Climate change is also leading to changes in storm tracks and the formation of new types of storms.\n\nLand\n\nClimate change is having significant impacts on land, including changes in sea levels, increases in extreme weather events, and shifts in ecosystem boundaries.\n\n### Floods\n\nFlooding is becoming more frequent and severe, especially in low-lying coastal areas and river valleys. This can have significant impacts on human settlements, agriculture, and ecosystems.\n\n### Droughts\n\nDroughts are also becoming more frequent and prolonged, especially in areas with changing precipitation patterns. This can have significant impacts on agriculture, water resources, and ecosystems.\n\n### Wildfires\n\nClimate change is leading to an increase in wildfires, especially in areas with changing precipitation patterns and rising temperatures. This can have significant impacts on ecosystems, human settlements, and air quality.\n\nOceans\n\nClimate change is having significant impacts on the world's oceans, including changes in sea levels, ocean acidification, and shifts in ecosystem boundaries.\n\n### Sea Level Rise\n\nSea levels are rising due to the melting of glaciers and ice sheets, as well as the thermal expansion of seawater. This can have significant impacts on coastal ecosystems, human settlements, and infrastructure.\n\nIce and Snow\n\nClimate change is also having significant impacts on ice and snow, including changes in glacier extent, ice sheet thickness, and snow cover.\n\n### Glaciers Decline\n\nGlaciers are declining in size and extent, leading to changes in sea levels, water resources, and ecosystems.\n\n### Ice Sheets Decline\n\nIce sheets, including those in Greenland and Antarctica, are also declining in size and extent, leading to changes in sea levels and global weather patterns.\n\n### Sea Ice Decline\n\nSea ice is declining in extent and thickness, especially in the Arctic, leading to changes in ocean currents, ecosystems, and global weather patterns.\n\n### Permafrost Thawing\n\nPermafrost, a type of frozen soil found in high-latitude regions, is thawing due to rising temperatures, leading to changes in ecosystems, infrastructure, and global weather patterns.\n\nWildlife and Nature\n\nClimate change is having significant impacts on wildlife and ecosystems, including changes in species distributions, extinction risk, and ecosystem function.\n\n### Ecosystems on Land\n\nEcosystems on land, including forests, grasslands, and tundras, are changing in response to climate change, leading to changes in species distributions, ecosystem function, and human well-being.\n\n### Marine Ecosystems\n\nMarine ecosystems, including coral reefs, estuaries, and open ocean ecosystems, are also changing in response to climate change, leading to changes in species distributions, ecosystem function, and human well-being.\n\nTipping Points and Irreversible Impacts\n\nClimate change is pushing many ecosystems and human societies towards tipping points, beyond which irreversible impacts can occur.

With a career spanning over three decades, Stelaru's life was marked by both success and hardship, including a notable death hoax, periods of censorship, and eventual obscurity. This article will explore the life and legacy of Dimitrie Stelaru, one of Romania's most beloved folk singers.\n\n# Biography\n\n## Early life\n\nDimitrie Stelaru was born on February 15, 1917, in the small village of Măldăeni, located in the Teleorman County of Romania. Growing up in a family of modest means, Stelaru was the youngest of six children. His parents, both peasants, encouraged his love for music from an early age. Stelaru's early life was marked by a deep connection to traditional Romanian folk music, which he learned from his family and community.\n\n## Debut and death-hoax\n\nStelaru's musical career began in the 1930s, when he started performing at local weddings and festivals. His unique voice and charismatic stage presence quickly gained him popularity, and he soon became a sought-after performer in the region. However, in 1941, a false rumor of Stelaru's death spread, leading to widespread mourning among his fans. The rumor was eventually dispelled, but not before it had gained significant attention in the media.\n\n## Albatros years\n\nIn the early 1940s, Stelaru joined the Albatros ensemble, a prominent folk music group in Romania. During his time with Albatros, Stelaru's popularity soared, and he became known for his powerful and emotive performances. The ensemble's repertoire included traditional folk songs, as well as modern compositions, which Stelaru helped to popularize. His collaborations with other notable musicians of the time, such as Ioan Bocșa and Nicolae Guță, further solidified his position as a leading figure in Romanian folk music.\n\n## Antonescu-era repression and late 1940s\n\nFollowing the rise of Marshal Ion Antonescu to power in 1940, Romania's cultural landscape underwent significant changes. The new regime imposed strict censorship and repression, which had a profound impact on the country's artistic community. Stelaru, like many other musicians, was forced to adapt to the new circumstances, and his music was subject to censorship. Despite these challenges, Stelaru continued to perform and record music, albeit under increasingly difficult conditions.\n\n## Censoring and obscurity\n\nIn the late 1940s and early 1950s, Stelaru's music was subject to increased censorship, and he was eventually forced to abandon his career as a performer. The communist regime, which had come to power in 1947, viewed Stelaru's music as too folkloric and not in line with the new socialist ideals. As a result, his music was largely forgotten, and he was relegated to obscurity.\n\n## Final return\n\nIn the 1970s, Stelaru made a final return to the music scene, albeit in a limited capacity. His music experienced a brief resurgence in popularity, thanks in part to the efforts of younger musicians who sought to revive traditional Romanian folk music. Although his health was declining, Stelaru continued to perform and record music until his death on December 14, 1971.\n\n# Legacy\n\nDimitrie Stelaru's legacy as a folk singer and cultural icon is still celebrated in Romania today. His unique voice and contributions to traditional music have inspired generations of musicians, and his music remains an integral part of the country's cultural heritage. Despite the challenges and hardships he faced during his career, Stelaru's dedication to his craft and his people has left a lasting impact on Romanian music and culture.\n\n# Notes\n\n# References", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Dimitrie_Stelaru\" following this outline:\n\n#Biography\n##Early life\n##Debut and death-hoax\n##Albatros years\n##Antonescu-era repression and late 1940s\n##Censoring and obscurity\n##Final return\n#Legacy\n#Notes\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

She was the longest-reigning British monarch, serving for over 70 years, and the longest-married British monarch, with over 73 years of marriage to Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.\n\n# Early life\n\nElizabeth Alexandra Mary was born on 21 April 1926, during the reign of her paternal grandfather, King George V. Her father, Prince Albert, Duke of York (later King George VI), was the second son of the king, and her mother, Elizabeth, Duchess of York (later Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother), was the youngest daughter of the Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne. Elizabeth was the first child of the duke and duchess, and her younger sister, Princess Margaret, was born in 1930.\n\nAt the time of her birth, Elizabeth was third in line to the British throne, after her uncle Edward, Prince of Wales, and her father. However, her uncle's decision to marry Wallis Simpson, an American divorcee, in 1936 led to his abdication and her father's accession to the throne. As a result, Elizabeth became the heir presumptive at the age of 10.\n\n# Heir presumptive\n\n## Second World War\n\nDuring the Second World War, Elizabeth and her sister Margaret were evacuated to the countryside for their safety. They spent most of the war years at Balmoral Castle in Scotland and at Sandringham House in Norfolk. Elizabeth made her first radio broadcast in 1940, during the BBC's Children's Hour, sending a message of support to other children who had been evacuated.\n\nIn 1942, Elizabeth was appointed Colonel-in-Chief of the Grenadier Guards, and in 1944, she was promoted to the rank of honorary colonel of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. She began to take on more royal duties during the war, accompanying her parents to events and engagements.\n\n## Marriage\n\nIn 1947, Elizabeth married Prince Philip, a former prince of Greece and Denmark, at Westminster Abbey. The wedding was a grand affair, with over 2,000 guests in attendance. Philip was naturalized as a British subject and took the surname Mountbatten. The couple had four children: Charles, Prince of Wales, Anne, Princess Royal, Prince Andrew, Duke of York, and Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex.\n\n# Reign\n\n## Accession and coronation\n\nElizabeth's father, King George VI, died on 6 February 1952, and Elizabeth ascended to the throne at the age of 25. She was crowned queen on 2 June 1953, at Westminster Abbey, in a ceremony that was broadcast on television for the first time.\n\n## Early reign\n\nIn the early years of her reign, Elizabeth focused on rebuilding the British Commonwealth, which had been weakened by the Second World War. She traveled extensively throughout the Commonwealth, visiting over 120 countries and territories.\n\nIn 1957, Elizabeth made her first televised Christmas broadcast, a tradition that she continued for over 60 years. She also began to use television to reach a wider audience, using the medium to promote the monarchy and the Commonwealth.\n\n## Political reforms and crises\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, Elizabeth faced several challenges to her authority, including the decolonization of Africa, the rise of nationalism in Scotland and Wales, and the decline of the British Empire. She also faced personal challenges, including the death of her sister, Princess Margaret, in 2002.\n\nIn 1975, Elizabeth faced a constitutional crisis when the Australian government, led by Prime Minister Gough Whitlam, was dismissed by the Governor-General, Sir John Kerr, who was the representative of the Queen in Australia.
