The movement is characterized by its emphasis on the existence of a higher, eternal realm of being, and the potential for human souls to ascend to this realm through philosophical contemplation and spiritual practices. Neoplatonism had a profound influence on Western philosophy, particularly in the areas of metaphysics, epistemology, and the nature of the human soul.\n\nOrigins of the term\n-------------------\n\nThe term \"Neoplatonism\" was first used in the 19th century to distinguish the philosophical movement founded by Plotinus from the ideas of Plato, whose philosophy Plotinus sought to interpret and develop. The term \"Neoplatonism\" is somewhat misleading, as it implies a direct connection between Plotinus and Plato, which is not entirely accurate. Plotinus' philosophy was deeply influenced by Plato's ideas, but it also incorporated elements from other philosophical traditions, such as Stoicism and Aristotelianism.\n\nOrigins and history of classical Neoplatonism\n--------------------------------------------\n\n### Hellenism\n\nNeoplatonism emerged in the Hellenistic period, a time of great cultural and intellectual transformation in the Mediterranean world. The Hellenistic period saw the rise of new philosophical schools, such as Stoicism and Epicureanism, which emphasized the pursuit of virtue and the avoidance of pain. Neoplatonism, however, was deeply rooted in the Platonic tradition, which emphasized the existence of a higher, eternal realm of being.\n\n### Ammonius Saccas\n\nThe Egyptian philosopher Ammonius Saccas is often credited with being the founder of Neoplatonism. Ammonius was a teacher of Plotinus, and his philosophy emphasized the importance of spiritual practices, such as meditation and contemplation, in achieving spiritual enlightenment.\n\n### Plotinus\n\nPlotinus (205-270 AD) was a Greek philosopher who is widely regarded as the founder of Neoplatonism. Plotinus was born in Egypt and studied philosophy in Alexandria, where he was influenced by the ideas of Ammonius Saccas. In 244 AD, Plotinus traveled to Rome, where he founded a philosophical school and attracted a large following of students.\n\n### Porphyry\n\nPorphyry (234-305 AD) was a Greek philosopher who was a student of Plotinus. Porphyry is best known for his book \"Isagoge,\" which is an introduction to the philosophy of Aristotle. Porphyry's philosophy emphasized the importance of spiritual practices, such as meditation and contemplation, in achieving spiritual enlightenment.\n\n### Iamblichus\n\nIamblichus (245-325 AD) was a Greek philosopher who was a student of Porphyry. Iamblichus is best known for his book \"On the Mysteries,\" which is a comprehensive guide to the spiritual practices of Neoplatonism. Iamblichus' philosophy emphasized the importance of theurgy, or the practice of ritual magic, in achieving spiritual enlightenment.\n\n### Academies\n\nNeoplatonism was taught in a number of philosophical academies, including the Academy of Athens, which was founded by Plato. The Academy of Athens was a major center of Neoplatonic learning, and it attracted students from all over the Mediterranean world.\n\n### Hypatia\n\nHypatia (c. 350-415 AD) was a Greek philosopher and mathematician who was a teacher of Neoplatonism. Hypatia was a prominent figure in the intellectual life of Alexandria, and she was known for her beauty, her intelligence, and her spiritual wisdom.\n\n### Proclus\n\nProclus (412-485 AD) was a Greek philosopher who was a student of the Neoplatonist philosopher Plutarch of Athens. Proclus is best known for his comprehensive commentary on the philosophy of Plato, which is still studied by scholars today. Proclus' philosophy emphasized the importance of spiritual practices, such as meditation and contemplation, in achieving spiritual enlightenment.\n\nIdeas\n-----\n\n### The One\n\nNeoplatonism is based on the idea that there is a single, eternal, and unchanging reality that underlies all of existence. This reality is often referred to as \"The One,\" and it is seen as the source of all being and all life. The One is often described as a unity of opposites, a single reality that encompasses all contradictions and paradoxes.\n\n### Emanations\n\nNeoplatonism teaches that The One emanates a series of lesser realities, each of which is a reflection of the divine. These emanations are often referred to as \"hypostases,\" and they include the Demiurge, the World-Soul, and the phenomenal world.\n\n#### Demiurge or nous\n\nThe Demiurge, also known as the nous, is the first emanation of The One. The Demiurge is seen as a divine intelligence that creates the world and governs its operations. The Demiurge is often identified with the divine logos, or reason, that underlies all of existence.\n\n#### World-soul\n\nThe World-Soul is the second emanation of The One. The World-Soul is seen as a divine energy that animates the world and governs its operations. The World-Soul is often identified with the divine psyche, or soul, that underlies all of existence.\n\n#### Phenomenal world\n\nThe phenomenal world is the third emanation of The One. The phenomenal world is seen as a world of appearances, a world that is subject to change and impermanence. The phenomenal world is often identified with the world of sense experience, the world that we experience through our senses.\n\n### Celestial hierarchy\n\nNeoplatonism teaches that there is a celestial hierarchy of beings that inhabit the spiritual realm. This hierarchy includes the gods, the angels, and the demons, each of which has a specific role to play in the governance of the universe.\n\n### Evil\n\nNeoplatonism teaches that evil is not a positive reality, but rather the absence of good. Evil is seen as a privation, a lack of being or a lack of goodness. This view of evil is often referred to as the \"privation theory\" of evil.\n\n### Return to the One\n\nNeoplatonism teaches that the ultimate goal of human existence is to return to The One, to achieve spiritual enlightenment and union with the divine. This return is often referred to as \"henosis,\" or the unity of all things.\n\nInfluence\n----------\n\n### Early Christianity\n\nNeoplatonism had a significant influence on the development of early Christianity. Many of the early Christian theologians, including Origen and Augustine, were influenced by Neoplatonic ideas.\n\n#### Augustine\n\nAugustine (354-430 AD) was a Christian theologian who was deeply influenced by Neoplatonic ideas. Augustine's philosophy emphasized the importance of spiritual practices, such as prayer and contemplation, in achieving spiritual enlightenment.\n\n#### Origen and Pseudo-Dionysius\n\nOrigen (185-254 AD) was a Christian theologian who was influenced by Neoplatonic ideas. Origen's philosophy emphasized the importance of spiritual practices, such as meditation and contemplation, in achieving spiritual enlightenment. Pseudo-Dionysius (fl. 5th century AD) was a Christian theologian who wrote a series of treatises on the nature of God and the universe. Pseudo-Dionysius' philosophy was deeply influenced by Neoplatonic ideas.\n\n#### Gnosticism\n\nGnosticism was a Christian sect that emerged in the 1st century AD. Gnosticism emphasized the importance of spiritual knowledge, or gnosis, in achieving spiritual enlightenment. Gnosticism was influenced by Neoplatonic ideas, and it shared many similarities with Neoplatonism.\n\n### Byzantine education\n\nNeoplatonism played a significant role in the development of Byzantine education. The Byzantine Empire, which was the Eastern Roman Empire, placed a strong emphasis on education and learning. Neoplatonic ideas were taught in the schools and universities of the Byzantine Empire.\n\n### Islamic neoplatonism\n\nNeoplatonism had a significant influence on the development of Islamic philosophy. Many of the early Islamic philosophers, including Al-Kindi and Al-Farabi, were influenced by Neoplatonic ideas.\n\n### Jewish thought\n\nNeoplatonism had a significant influence on the development of Jewish thought. Many of the early Jewish philosophers, including Philo of Alexandria and Maimonides, were influenced by Neoplatonic ideas.\n\n### Medieval Christian Thought\n\nNeoplatonism played a significant role in the development of medieval Christian thought. Many of the medieval Christian theologians, including Thomas Aquinas, were influenced by Neoplatonic ideas.\n\n### Western Renaissance\n\nNeoplatonism played a significant role in the development of the Western Renaissance. Many of the Renaissance humanists, including Marsilio Ficino and Pico della Mirandola, were influenced by Neoplatonic ideas.\n\n### Cambridge Platonists (17th century)\n\nThe Cambridge Platonists were a group of English philosophers who were influenced by Neoplatonic ideas. The Cambridge Platonists emphasized the importance of spiritual practices, such as meditation and contemplation, in achieving spiritual enlightenment.\n\n### Modern neoplatonism\n\nNeoplatonism continues to influence modern thought and culture. Many of the modern spiritual movements, including Theosophy and Anthroposophy, have been influenced by Neoplatonic ideas.\n\nSee also\n----------\n\n* Platonism\n* Stoicism\n* Aristotelianism\n* Gnosticism\n* Hermeticism\n* Theosophy\n* Anthroposophy\n\nNotes\n------\n\nThis article is based on the information available as of [insert date].

From its origins in school dramas and nativity scenes to the development of Ukrainian-language opera, the country has produced a unique and distinctive operatic tradition. This article provides an overview of the history of opera in Ukraine, from its early beginnings to the present day.\n\nOrigins\n--------\n\n### Shkilʹna dramy (school dramas)\n\nThe earliest forms of opera in Ukraine date back to the 17th century, when school dramas were performed in Kiev and other cities. These dramas were typically based on biblical themes and were performed by students and teachers. Over time, these dramas evolved into more complex productions, incorporating music, dance, and elaborate costumes.\n\n### Vertepy (nativity scenes)\n\nAnother important influence on the development of Ukrainian opera was the vertep, a traditional nativity scene that was performed during the Christmas season. Vertepy were typically performed by traveling troupes of actors, musicians, and singers, who would reenact the story of the Nativity using music, dance, and mime.\n\n### Vaudeville\n\nIn the 18th century, vaudeville became a popular form of entertainment in Ukraine. Vaudeville was a type of variety show that featured music, dance, and comedy, often with a narrative thread. Vaudeville was influential in the development of Ukrainian opera, as it introduced new forms of musical theater and helped to establish a tradition of popular entertainment.\n\nOperetta\n--------\n\nOperetta was another important genre that emerged in Ukraine during the 19th century. Operetta was a type of light opera that was characterized by its witty dialogue, memorable melodies, and comedic plots. Ukrainian operetta was influenced by European models, but it also developed its own unique style and themes.\n\nObstacles to the development of Ukrainian-language opera\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nDespite the rich cultural heritage of Ukraine, the development of Ukrainian-language opera was hindered by a number of obstacles. One of the main challenges was the dominance of Russian culture and language in Ukraine, which made it difficult for Ukrainian-language opera to gain traction. Additionally, the lack of a strong tradition of musical theater in Ukraine made it challenging to establish a professional opera company.\n\nEmergence of Ukrainian opera\n---------------------------\n\n### Mykola Lysenko\n\nOne of the key figures in the emergence of Ukrainian-language opera was Mykola Lysenko (1842-1912). Lysenko was a composer, conductor, and pianist who is often credited with establishing the Ukrainian national opera. He was a prolific composer who wrote over 100 works, including operas, operettas, and choral music. Lysenko's music was influenced by Ukrainian folk music and literature, and he was a strong advocate for the development of Ukrainian-language opera.\n\n### Lysenko's contemporaries and successors\n\nLysenko was not alone in his efforts to establish Ukrainian-language opera. Other composers, such as Mykola Arkas (1853-1909) and Viktor Kosenko (1896-1938), also made significant contributions to the development of Ukrainian opera. These composers drew on Ukrainian folk music and literature, as well as European models, to create a unique and distinctive operatic tradition.\n\nPeriod of resurgence\n-------------------\n\n### 1910s\n\nThe 1910s saw a resurgence of interest in Ukrainian-language opera, with the establishment of several new opera companies and the composition of new operas. One of the most important events of this period was the premiere of Mykola Lysenko's opera \"Taras Bulba\" in 1910. This opera was based on the novel of the same name by Nikolai Gogol and was a major success.\n\n### 1920s and early 1930s\n\nThe 1920s and early 1930s saw a continued growth of interest in Ukrainian-language opera, with the establishment of new opera companies and the composition of new operas. One of the most important events of this period was the premiere of the opera \"Zaporozhets za Dunayem\" (Cossack Beyond the Danube) by Semen Hulak-Artemovsky (1813-1873). This opera was based on a poem by Ivan Kulik and was a major success.\n\n#### Historical opera\n\nDuring this period, there was also a growing interest in historical opera, which drew on Ukrainian history and folklore for its themes and subjects. One of the most important examples of this genre was the opera \"Bohdan Khmelnytsky\" by Konstantin Dankevych (1905-1984). This opera was based on the life of the Ukrainian Cossack leader Bohdan Khmelnytsky and was a major success.\n\nStalinism (1932-1956)\n--------------------\n\n### World War II\n\nDuring World War II, Ukrainian-language opera continued to develop, despite the challenges posed by the war. Many opera companies were forced to evacuate to other parts of the Soviet Union, where they continued to perform and compose new works.\n\n### 1945-1953\n\nAfter the war, Ukrainian-language opera continued to grow and develop, with the establishment of new opera companies and the composition of new operas. One of the most important events of this period was the premiere of the opera \"Taras Shevchenko\" by Heorhiy Maiboroda (1913-1992). This opera was based on the life of the Ukrainian poet and artist Taras Shevchenko and was a major success.\n\n1953-1991\n---------\n\n### 1953-1970\n\nThe period from 1953 to 1970 saw a continued growth of interest in Ukrainian-language opera, with the establishment of new opera companies and the composition of new operas. One of the most important events of this period was the premiere of the opera \"Roksolana\" by Borys Lyatoshynsky (1895-1968). This opera was based on the life of the Ukrainian queen Roksolana and was a major success.\n\n### 1970s\n\nThe 1970s saw a continued growth of interest in Ukrainian-language opera, with the establishment of new opera companies and the composition of new operas. One of the most important events of this period was the premiere of the opera \"Zagadka Vynogradova\" (The Enigma of Vynogradov) by Valentyn Bibik (1940-2003). This opera was based on a novel by the Ukrainian writer Vasyl Vynogradov and was a major success.\n\n### 1980s\n\nThe 1980s saw a continued growth of interest in Ukrainian-language opera, with the establishment of new opera companies and the composition of new operas. One of the most important events of this period was the premiere of the opera \"Ivan Kupala\" by Mykola Dremliuha (1917-1998). This opera was based on a poem by the Ukrainian poet Mykola Zerov and was a major success.\n\nPost-independence operas\n-----------------------\n\nSince Ukraine gained independence in 1991, there has been a continued growth of interest in Ukrainian-language opera, with the establishment of new opera companies and the composition of new operas. One of the most important events of this period was the premiere of the opera \"Molodist\" (Youth) by Hanna Havrylets (1958-). This opera was based on a novel by the Ukrainian writer Myroslav Dochynets and was a major success.\n\nOpera houses\n------------\n\nUkraine has a number of opera houses, including the National Opera of Ukraine in Kiev, the Odessa Opera and Ballet Theatre, and the Lviv Opera House. These opera houses are home to a number of professional opera companies and host a wide range of operas and other musical performances throughout the year.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n### Notes\n\n*Note: This article does not include citations or references.*\n\n### Citations\n\n*None*\n\n### Sources\n\n*None*\n\nFurther reading\n---------------\n\n*Note: This section is not included in the article.*\n\nExternal links\n--------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Opera_in_Ukraine\" following this outline:\n\n#Origins\n##Shkilʹna dramy (school dramas)\n##Vertepy (nativity scenes)\n##Vaudeville\n#Operetta\n#Obstacles to the development of Ukrainian-language opera\n#Emergence of Ukrainian opera\n##Mykola Lysenko\n##Lysenko's contemporaries and successors\n#Period of resurgence\n##1910s\n##1920s and early 1930s\n###Historical opera\n#Stalinism (1932–1956)\n##World War II\n##1945–1953\n#1953–1991\n##1953–1970\n##1970s\n##1980s\n#Post-independence operas\n#Opera houses\n#References\n##Notes\n##Citations\n##Sources\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He was able to leverage his skills in leadership and management to build a team of experts and secure funding for his expeditions.\n\n##Deep-Sea Exploration\n\nRush's entry into the world of deep-sea exploration was marked by a series of high-profile expeditions.

Rush's leadership and vision were instrumental in bringing the project to fruition.\n\n#Titan expedition and death\n\nThe Titanic expedition was a groundbreaking achievement, marking the first time a team had visited the wreck site in a submersible vessel. Rush and his team spent hours exploring the wreck, collecting data, and conducting research.\n\nTragically, Rush's life was cut short during the expedition. On June 18, 2023, Rush's submersible vessel, Titan, imploded while returning to the surface, resulting in his death.\n\nThe news of Rush's passing sent shockwaves through the scientific community and beyond. Tributes poured in from around the world, celebrating his life, achievements, and contributions to our understanding of the ocean.\n\n##Investigation and Legacy\n\nAn investigation into the incident was launched, and the cause of the implosion is still unknown. Despite the tragic circumstances of his death, Rush's legacy lives on through his contributions to deep-sea exploration and the scientific community.\n\nRush's vision and leadership inspired a new generation of explorers and researchers. His work continues to advance our understanding of the ocean and its ecosystems, ensuring a lasting impact on the world.\n\n#Personal life\n\nStockton Rush was known for his charismatic personality and infectious enthusiasm. He was a natural leader, able to inspire and motivate those around him.\n\nRush was married to his wife, Shannon, and had two children.

Some users have expressed concerns that their personal data may have been compromised, while others have argued that the company's content moderation decisions may have been overly broad.\n\n## Former Twitter CEO\n\nJack Dorsey, the former CEO of Twitter, has stated that he was not aware of the company's content moderation decisions, particularly with regards to the New York Post story.

The storm caused widespread damage, flooding, and loss of life, particularly in Libya, where it led to catastrophic dam failures and displacement of thousands of people.\n\n# Meteorological history\n\nStorm Daniel formed in the Mediterranean Sea on September 10, 2023, as a low-pressure system that rapidly intensified into a powerful storm. The storm system was fueled by warm waters and a strong jet stream, which contributed to its rapid development and intensification. As the storm moved eastward, it brought strong winds, heavy rainfall, and rough seas to several countries in the region.\n\nThe storm's trajectory took it across the eastern Mediterranean, affecting countries such as Greece, Turkey, and Bulgaria, before making landfall in Libya on September 12. The storm's impact was exacerbated by its slow movement, which allowed it to linger over affected areas for an extended period, causing prolonged periods of heavy rainfall and flooding.\n\n# Impact\n\n## Greece\n\nIn Greece, Storm Daniel brought strong winds and heavy rainfall to several regions, particularly in the north and east of the country. The storm caused widespread power outages, with thousands of households left without electricity. The Greek authorities reported several incidents of flooding, particularly in the regions of Macedonia and Thrace.\n\nThe storm also affected the country's transportation network, with several roads and highways closed due to flooding and landslides. The Greek government declared a state of emergency in several regions, deploying emergency services and military personnel to assist with relief efforts.\n\n## Turkey\n\nIn Turkey, Storm Daniel brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to several provinces, particularly in the north and west of the country. The storm caused widespread flooding, particularly in the provinces of Istanbul and İzmir. The Turkish authorities reported several incidents of landslides and power outages, with thousands of households left without electricity.\n\nThe storm also affected the country's transportation network, with several roads and highways closed due to flooding and landslides. The Turkish government declared a state of emergency in several provinces, deploying emergency services and military personnel to assist with relief efforts.\n\n## Bulgaria\n\nIn Bulgaria, Storm Daniel brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to several regions, particularly in the north and east of the country. The storm caused widespread flooding, particularly in the regions of Vidin and Vratsa. The Bulgarian authorities reported several incidents of power outages, with thousands of households left without electricity.\n\nThe storm also affected the country's transportation network, with several roads and highways closed due to flooding and landslides. The Bulgarian government declared a state of emergency in several regions, deploying emergency services and military personnel to assist with relief efforts.\n\n## Libya\n\nIn Libya, Storm Daniel had a devastating impact, particularly in the eastern region of the country. The storm caused widespread flooding, particularly in the city of Derna, where several dams failed, leading to catastrophic consequences.\n\n### Preparations\n\nBefore the storm made landfall, the Libyan authorities had issued several warnings and alerts, advising citizens to take necessary precautions and evacuate areas at risk of flooding. However, the country's emergency services and infrastructure were severely underprepared to deal with the scale of the disaster.\n\n### Derna dam failures\n\nThe storm caused the failure of two dams in the Derna region, leading to catastrophic flooding and displacement of thousands of people. The dams, which were built in the 1970s, were not designed to withstand the intensity of the storm.\n\nThe failure of the dams led to widespread flooding, with water levels rising to as high as 3 meters in some areas. The flooding caused widespread destruction, with thousands of homes and buildings destroyed or damaged. The Libyan authorities reported several incidents of loss of life, with many more people missing.\n\n### Other areas\n\nIn addition to Derna, other areas of Libya were also affected by the storm, including the cities of Benghazi and Tobruk. The storm caused widespread flooding, particularly in low-lying areas, and several incidents of power outages.\n\n### Nationwide impact\n\nThe storm had a nationwide impact, with several regions affected by flooding, power outages, and transportation disruptions. The Libyan government declared a state of emergency, deploying emergency services and military personnel to assist with relief efforts.\n\n## Egypt\n\nIn Egypt, Storm Daniel brought strong winds and heavy rainfall to several regions, particularly in the north and east of the country. The storm caused widespread power outages, with thousands of households left without electricity.\n\nThe storm also affected the country's transportation network, with several roads and highways closed due to flooding and landslides. The Egyptian government declared a state of emergency in several regions, deploying emergency services and military personnel to assist with relief efforts.\n\n## Israel\n\nIn Israel, Storm Daniel brought strong winds and heavy rainfall to several regions, particularly in the north and east of the country. The storm caused widespread power outages, with thousands of households left without electricity.\n\nThe storm also affected the country's transportation network, with several roads and highways closed due to flooding and landslides. The Israeli government declared a state of emergency in several regions, deploying emergency services and military personnel to assist with relief efforts.\n\n# Aftermath\n\n## Libya\n\n### Domestic reactions\n\nThe Libyan government faced widespread criticism for its handling of the crisis, with many accusing the authorities of being slow to respond and underprepared to deal with the scale of the disaster.\n\n### International reactions\n\nThe international community offered condolences and support to Libya, with several countries pledging aid and assistance to help with relief efforts.\n\n## Economic effects\n\nThe storm had significant economic effects, particularly in Libya, where the country's infrastructure and economy were severely impacted. The storm caused widespread damage to homes, buildings, and infrastructure, with estimates suggesting that the damage could run into billions of dollars.\n\n## Effects on migration\n\nThe storm also had significant effects on migration, particularly in Libya, where the country's migration crisis was exacerbated by the disaster. The storm led to a surge in migration, with many people attempting to flee the country in search of safety and security.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of Mediterranean storms\n* List of natural disasters in Libya\n* List of floods in Libya\n\n# References\n\n## Notes\n\n## Citations", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Storm_Daniel\" following this outline:\n\n#Meteorological history\n#Impact\n##Greece\n##Turkey\n##Bulgaria\n##Libya\n###Preparations\n###Derna dam failures\n###Other areas\n###Nationwide impact\n##Egypt\n##Israel\n#Aftermath\n##Libya\n###Domestic reactions\n###International reactions\n##Economic effects\n##Effects on migration\n#See also\n#References\n##Notes\n##Citations\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This system is designed to promote nonpartisan elections and increase voter participation. In this article, we will explore the usage, benefits, and drawbacks of top-four primaries, as well as variations of this system.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nTop-four primaries are used in several states in the United States. The following sections will provide an overview of the usage of top-four primaries in Alaska and Missouri, as well as the usage of a similar system, top-five primaries, in Nevada.\n\n### Top-four\n\n#### Alaska\n\nAlaska adopted a top-four primary system in 2020, which was first used in the 2022 primary election. Under this system, all candidates for a particular office appear on the same primary ballot, and the top four candidates advance to the general election. This system is designed to promote nonpartisan elections and increase voter participation.\n\n#### Missouri\n\nMissouri has also adopted a top-four primary system, which was first used in the 2020 primary election. The system is similar to Alaska's, with all candidates appearing on the same primary ballot and the top four candidates advancing to the general election.\n\n### Top-five\n\n#### Nevada\n\nNevada uses a top-five primary system, in which the top five candidates advance to the general election. This system is similar to the top-four primary system used in Alaska and Missouri, but allows one additional candidate to advance to the general election.\n\nBenefits\n--------\n\nThe top-four primary system has several benefits. One of the main benefits is that it promotes nonpartisan elections. By allowing all candidates to appear on the same primary ballot, regardless of party affiliation, the top-four primary system encourages voters to focus on the candidates' qualifications and policies rather than their party affiliation. This can lead to a more nuanced and informed voting process.\n\nAnother benefit of the top-four primary system is that it can increase voter participation. By allowing voters to choose from a wider range of candidates, the top-four primary system can increase voter engagement and encourage more people to participate in the electoral process.\n\nDrawbacks\n----------\n\nDespite its benefits, the top-four primary system also has some drawbacks. One of the main drawbacks is vote splitting.\n\n### Vote splitting\n\nVote splitting occurs when multiple candidates from the same party or with similar ideologies run in the same election, splitting the vote and allowing a candidate from a different party or with a different ideology to win. The top-four primary system can exacerbate vote splitting, as multiple candidates from the same party or with similar ideologies can advance to the general election.\n\n#### Primary\n\nIn the primary election, vote splitting can occur when multiple candidates from the same party or with similar ideologies run against each other. This can split the vote and allow a candidate from a different party or with a different ideology to advance to the general election.\n\n#### General\n\nIn the general election, vote splitting can occur when multiple candidates from the same party or with similar ideologies run against each other. This can split the vote and allow a candidate from a different party or with a different ideology to win the election.\n\n### Voter deception\n\nAnother drawback of the top-four primary system is voter deception. Some critics argue that the system can be confusing for voters, particularly in cases where multiple candidates with similar names or ideologies run in the same election. This can lead to voters accidentally voting for the wrong candidate or being deceived into voting for a candidate who does not align with their values.\n\nVariations\n----------\n\nThere are several variations of the top-four primary system. The following sections will provide an overview of the Final Five Voting system, as well as the primary, post-primary, and general election variations of the top-four primary system.\n\n### Final Five Voting\n\nFinal Five Voting is a variant of the top-four primary system in which the top five candidates advance to the general election. This system is similar to the top-four primary system, but allows one additional candidate to advance to the general election.\n\n### Primary\n\nIn the primary election variation of the top-four primary system, all candidates appear on the same primary ballot, and the top four candidates advance to the general election. This system is designed to promote nonpartisan elections and increase voter participation.\n\n### Post-primary\n\nIn the post-primary variation of the top-four primary system, the top four candidates advance to a runoff election, in which the top two candidates are chosen to advance to the general election. This system is designed to ensure that the top two candidates are chosen based on a majority vote.\n\n### General\n\nIn the general election variation of the top-four primary system, the top four candidates appear on the same general election ballot, and the candidate with the most votes wins the election. This system is designed to promote nonpartisan elections and increase voter participation.\n\n### Summary\n\nIn summary, the top-four primary system has several benefits, including promoting nonpartisan elections and increasing voter participation. However, it also has some drawbacks, including vote splitting and voter deception. There are several variations of the top-four primary system, including the Final Five Voting system and the primary, post-primary, and general election variations.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Instant-runoff voting\n* Nonpartisan blanket primary\n* Top-two primary\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n*Note: This article does not include any citations or references.\n\nExternal links\n---------------\n\n*Note: This article does not include any external links.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Top-four_primary\" following this outline:\n\n#Usage\n##Top-four\n###Alaska\n###Missouri\n##Top-five\n###Nevada\n#Benefits\n#Drawbacks\n##Vote splitting\n###Primary\n###General\n##Voter deception\n#Variations\n##Final Five Voting\n##Primary\n##Post-primary\n##General\n##Summary\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The film follows the story of Meilin \"Mei\" Lee, a Chinese-Canadian teenager who struggles to balance her relationships with her family and friends while navigating adolescence. Turning Red features a unique blend of Asian culture, nostalgic 2000s references, and Pixar's signature storytelling.\n\nPlot\n-----\n\nThe film takes place in the early 2000s in Toronto, Canada, and follows the life of Meilin \"Mei\" Lee, a 13-year-old Chinese-Canadian girl who is obsessed with a boy band called 4*Town. Mei is a dedicated student and a dutiful daughter to her overbearing mother, Ming, who owns a temple dedicated to the Chinese goddess, Sun Yat-sen. Mei's life is turned upside down when she wakes up one morning to discover that she has transformed into a giant red panda.\n\nAs Mei navigates her new condition, she learns that she is not alone. Her ancestors had made a deal with the red panda spirit to protect their family from harm, but the spirit's power comes with a price: whenever Mei experiences strong emotions, she transforms into the red panda. Mei must learn to control her emotions and find a way to reverse the curse before the Chinese New Year celebrations, when her family's secrets will be revealed.\n\nVoice Cast\n------------\n\nThe film features an ensemble voice cast, including:\n\n* Rosalie Chiang as Meilin \"Mei\" Lee\n* Sandra Oh as Ming Lee, Mei's mother\n* Awkwafina as Miriam Mendelsohn, Mei's friend\n* Hyein Park as Abby Park, Mei's friend\n* Maitreyi Ramakrishnan as Priya Mangal, Mei's friend\n* Wai Ching Ho as Nai Nai, Mei's grandmother\n* Orlando Bloom as Devin, a convenience store clerk\n\nProduction\n------------\n\n### Development\n\nTurning Red was first conceived in 2018 by Domee Shi, a Chinese-Canadian animator and filmmaker who had previously worked on the Pixar short film Bao. Shi drew inspiration from her own experiences growing up as a Chinese-Canadian teenager and her love of anime and manga. The film was originally pitched as a live-action/CGI hybrid, but Shi eventually decided to make it a fully animated film.\n\n### Casting\n\nThe voice cast was assembled over several months, with Rosalie Chiang being cast as Mei in 2020. Sandra Oh was cast as Ming, Mei's mother, shortly after. The rest of the voice cast was announced in 2021.\n\n### Design\n\n#### Setting\n\nThe film is set in the early 2000s in Toronto, Canada, and features a unique blend of Asian culture and Canadiana. The animation team drew inspiration from the city's diverse neighborhoods, including Chinatown and Kensington Market.\n\n#### Inspirations\n\nThe film's design was influenced by a range of sources, including anime, manga, and classic Disney films. Shi has cited Hayao Miyazaki's My Neighbor Totoro as a major influence on the film's design and tone.\n\n### Music\n\nThe film's soundtrack features a range of original songs, including \"Nobody Like U\" and \"U Know What's Up\". The score was composed by Ludwig Göransson, who had previously worked on the Pixar film Creed. The soundtrack also features a range of popular 2000s hits, including songs by Britney Spears and NSYNC.\n\nMarketing\n----------\n\n### Promotion\n\nThe film's marketing campaign began in 2021, with the release of a teaser trailer.

The conflict has resulted in significant human suffering, displacement, and economic costs. This article provides a detailed timeline of the key events and developments in the conflict, from the prelude to the current situation.\n\n# **Prelude**\n\nTensions between Russia and Ukraine had been escalating since the Ukrainian Revolution in 2014, which led to the ousting of pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych. Russia responded by annexing Crimea and supporting separatist movements in eastern Ukraine. The conflict in eastern Ukraine, known as the War in Donbas, resulted in significant loss of life and displacement.\n\nIn the years leading up to the 2022 invasion, Russia continued to increase its military presence along the Ukrainian border, while Ukraine sought to strengthen its military and diplomatic ties with Western countries. In 2021, Russia launched a series of military exercises near the Ukrainian border, which Ukraine and its allies saw as a provocation.\n\n# **Initial invasion**\n\nOn February 24, 2022, Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine, with attacks on multiple fronts. The invasion was preceded by a series of cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns, which aimed to disrupt Ukraine's military command and control systems.\n\nRussian forces quickly made gains in the north, east, and south of Ukraine, but their advance was slowed by Ukrainian resistance and logistical challenges. The Ukrainian military, with the support of civilians and international partners, was able to hold off the Russian advance in many areas.\n\n## **Kyiv campaign**\n\nThe Russian military focused significant efforts on capturing the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. However, the Ukrainian military was able to defend the city, and Russian forces were eventually repelled. The failure to capture Kyiv was a significant setback for Russia, as it had hoped to quickly overthrow the Ukrainian government.\n\n## **Kharkiv campaign**\n\nRussian forces also launched a campaign to capture the northeastern city of Kharkiv. However, Ukrainian forces were able to defend the city, and Russian advances were limited.\n\n# **Southeastern front**\n\nIn the southeast, Russian forces made significant gains, capturing large areas of territory in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. The Ukrainian military was forced to retreat from many areas, and Russian-backed separatists declared independence.\n\n## **Mariupol campaign**\n\nThe Russian military launched a campaign to capture the strategic port city of Mariupol, which was a key stronghold for Ukrainian forces in the southeast. After a prolonged siege, Russian forces were able to capture the city, but at significant cost in lives and infrastructure.\n\n## **Donbas campaign**\n\nRussian forces continued to push into the Donbas region, capturing key cities and territory. However, Ukrainian forces were able to hold off many Russian advances, and the conflict became increasingly static.\n\n# **2022 Ukrainian counteroffensives**\n\nIn the spring and summer of 2022, Ukrainian forces launched a series of counteroffensives, aimed at pushing back Russian advances and retaking lost territory. The counteroffensives were supported by significant amounts of Western military aid, including artillery and air defense systems.\n\n## **Kharkiv counteroffensive**\n\nUkrainian forces launched a successful counteroffensive in the Kharkiv region, pushing back Russian forces and retaking key territory.\n\n## **Kherson counteroffensive**\n\nUkrainian forces also launched a counteroffensive in the Kherson region, which was aimed at retaking the strategic city of Kherson. The counteroffensive was successful, and Ukrainian forces were able to capture the city.\n\n# **Second stalemate**\n\nBy the fall of 2022, the conflict had reached a stalemate, with both sides dug in and unable to make significant gains. The conflict had resulted in significant human suffering, displacement, and economic costs, and it was unclear how it would be resolved.\n\n## **Winter campaign**\n\nAs winter approached, both sides prepared for a protracted conflict. Russian forces launched a series of attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure, which were aimed at weakening the Ukrainian military and civilians.\n\n# **2023 Ukrainian counteroffensive**\n\nIn the spring of 2023, Ukrainian forces launched a new counteroffensive, aimed at pushing back Russian advances and retaking lost territory. The counteroffensive was supported by significant amounts of Western military aid, including tanks and fighter jets.\n\n## **Bakhmut campaign**\n\nUkrainian forces launched a campaign to capture the strategic city of Bakhmut, which was a key stronghold for Russian forces in the Donbas region.\n\n## **Kupyansk campaign**\n\nUkrainian forces also launched a campaign to capture the strategic city of Kupyansk, which was a key transportation hub in the Kharkiv region.\n\n# **Second winter campaign**\n\nAs winter approached, both sides prepared for a protracted conflict. Russian forces launched a series of attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure, which were aimed at weakening the Ukrainian military and civilians.\n\n# **See also**\n\n* War in Donbas\n* 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* Ukrainian resistance during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine\n\n# **References**\n\n* (none)\n\n# **External links**\n\n* (none)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Timeline_of_the_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine\" following this outline:\n\n#Prelude\n#Initial invasion\n#Southeastern front\n#2022 Ukrainian counteroffensives\n#Second stalemate\n#2023 Ukrainian counteroffensive\n#Second winter campaign\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The Boeing 737-800 aircraft was flying from Kunming to Guangzhou when it suddenly dived into a mountainous area, resulting in the deaths of all 132 people on board.\n\nFlight\n-----\n\nChina Eastern Airlines Flight 5735 departed Kunming Changshui International Airport at 08:16 local time (00:16 UTC) and was scheduled to arrive at Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport at 09:05 local time (01:05 UTC). The flight was operated by a Boeing 737-800 aircraft, registration B-1791. The flight crew consisted of three experienced pilots, and the aircraft was carrying 123 passengers and nine crew members.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\n### Aircraft\n\nThe Boeing 737-800 aircraft involved in the accident was manufactured in 2015 and had been in service with China Eastern Airlines since March 2015. The aircraft had accumulated over 18,000 flight hours and had undergone regular maintenance checks. The aircraft was equipped with two CFM International CFM56-7B engines and had a seating capacity of 164 passengers.\n\n### Passengers and Crew\n\nThe passengers on board the flight were mostly Chinese citizens, with a few foreign nationals.

Captain Zhu had over 6,000 hours of flight experience, while First Officer Xu had over 3,000 hours of flight experience. Second Officer Zhang had over 1,000 hours of flight experience.\n\nEmergency Response and Recovery\n-----------------------------\n\nThe crash site was located in a remote mountainous area, making it difficult for rescue teams to access. The Guangxi provincial government dispatched a search and rescue team to the scene, which included firefighters, police, and medical personnel. The team used helicopters and drones to survey the area and locate the wreckage.\n\nThe rescue effort was hampered by bad weather, with heavy rain and fog reducing visibility. The search and rescue team worked through the night, using flashlights and other equipment to search for survivors. Unfortunately, no survivors were found, and the rescue effort shifted to recovering the bodies of the victims.\n\nInvestigation\n-------------\n\n### Initial Investigation\n\nThe Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) launched an investigation into the crash immediately after the accident. The investigation team included officials from the CAAC, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), and Boeing. The team collected data from the aircraft's flight recorders and began analyzing the data to determine the cause of the crash.\n\n### Preliminary Report\n\nThe CAAC released a preliminary report on the crash in April 2022. The report stated that the investigation was ongoing, but preliminary data suggested that the aircraft had experienced a sudden loss of altitude and speed before crashing into the mountain. The report also stated that the aircraft's flight recorders had been recovered and were being analyzed.\n\n### Media Reports of the Investigation\n\nMedia reports suggested that the investigation was focusing on the possibility of pilot error or a technical malfunction. Some reports suggested that the aircraft's autopilot system may have malfunctioned, causing the aircraft to dive into the mountain. Other reports suggested that the pilots may have made an error, such as failing to properly configure the aircraft's flight controls.\n\n### Interim Report\n\nThe CAAC released an interim report on the crash in June 2022. The report stated that the investigation was ongoing, but preliminary data suggested that the aircraft had experienced a sudden loss of altitude and speed before crashing into the mountain. The report also stated that the aircraft's flight recorders had been recovered and were being analyzed. The report did not identify a specific cause for the crash, but stated that the investigation was continuing.\n\nReactions\n---------\n\n### Domestic\n\nThe crash of China Eastern Airlines Flight 5735 was met with widespread shock and grief in China. The Chinese government dispatched a team to the scene to assist with the rescue effort and provide support to the families of the victims. The government also announced that it would provide financial assistance to the families of the victims.\n\n### International\n\nThe international community expressed condolences to the families of the victims and offered assistance to the Chinese government.

He was one of the most accomplished musicians of his time, known for his technical skill, musicality, and innovative compositions. Saint-Georges' life was marked by his struggles against racism and his efforts to gain recognition as a musician, despite the societal norms of his time.\n\nEarly life\n-----------\n\nJoseph Bologne was born on December 25, 1748, on the island of Guadeloupe, to a wealthy plantation owner, Georges de Bologne Saint-Georges, and his African slave, Nanon. His father, who was also a musician, recognized his son's musical talent at an early age and provided him with musical training. In 1753, Saint-Georges' father moved the family to Paris, where he continued his son's musical education.\n\nMusical life and career\n----------------------\n\nSaint-Georges began his musical career as a violinist, performing in various orchestras and chamber music ensembles in Paris. He quickly gained recognition for his technical skill and musicality, and by the late 1760s, he was considered one of the most accomplished violinists in Paris. In 1769, he was appointed as the conductor of the Concert des Amateurs, a prominent concert society in Paris.\n\nOperas\n--------\n\nSaint-Georges composed several operas, including \"Ernestine\" (1777), \"La Partie de Chasse\" (1778), and \"L'Amant anonyme\" (1780). His operas were known for their innovative use of orchestration and their blend of French and Italian musical styles.\n\nSocial life in Paris\n--------------------\n\nSaint-Georges was a prominent figure in Parisian society, known for his charming personality and his musical talent. He was a frequent guest at the salons of prominent aristocrats and intellectuals, where he would perform and socialize with the cream of Parisian society.\n\nSt. Georges assaulted\n--------------------\n\nDespite his success and popularity, Saint-Georges faced racism and prejudice throughout his life. In 1787, he was assaulted by a group of men who were jealous of his success and resentful of his African heritage. The incident was widely reported in the press, and it marked a turning point in Saint-Georges' life, as he became increasingly aware of the societal norms and expectations that sought to limit his opportunities.\n\nTwo trips to London\n-------------------\n\nIn 1785, Saint-Georges traveled to London, where he performed as a violinist and composer. He was well-received by the London music scene, and his music was praised by critics and audiences alike.\n\nSecond trip\n------------\n\nIn 1787, Saint-Georges returned to London, where he composed several works, including his famous \"Symphonie concertante\" for two violins. The work was premiered at the Haymarket Theatre in London, and it was a major success.\n\nLille\n------\n\nIn 1791, Saint-Georges traveled to Lille, where he was appointed as the director of the local opera company. He stayed in Lille for several years, composing music and conducting performances.\n\nMilitary career\n----------------\n\nDuring the French Revolution, Saint-Georges joined the military, where he served as a lieutenant colonel in the Légion St-Georges, a regiment composed of soldiers of African descent. He fought in several battles, including the Battle of Valmy, and he was wounded in combat.\n\nPossible Saint-Domingue visit\n-----------------------------\n\nThere is evidence to suggest that Saint-Georges may have visited Saint-Domingue (present-day Haiti) in the late 1790s, although the exact nature and purpose of his visit are unclear.\n\nDeath\n------\n\nSaint-Georges died on June 10, 1799, in Paris, at the age of 50. His death was likely due to complications from his war injuries.\n\nHome\n-----\n\nSaint-Georges' home in Paris, located at 3, rue de la Tour-des-Dames, is now a museum dedicated to his life and work.\n\nWorks\n------\n\nOperas\n--------\n\n* \"Ernestine\" (1777)\n* \"La Partie de Chasse\" (1778)\n* \"L'Amant anonyme\" (1780)\n\nSymphonies\n------------\n\n* Symphony in G major, Op. 11, No. 1 (1779)\n* Symphony in D major, Op. 11, No. 2 (1780)\n\nConcertante\n------------\n\nViolin concertos\n-----------------\n\n* Violin Concerto in D major, Op. 2, No. 1 (1773)\n* Violin Concerto in A major, Op. 2, No. 2 (1774)\n\nSymphonies concertantes\n-------------------------\n\n* Symphonie concertante in G major, Op. 13 (1781)\n* Symphonie concertante in A major, Op. 14 (1782)\n\nChamber music\n--------------\n\nSonatas\n---------\n\n* Violin Sonata in A major, Op. 1, No. 1 (1772)\n* Violin Sonata in D major, Op. 1, No. 2 (1773)\n\nString quartet\n----------------\n\n* String Quartet in C major, Op. 1, No. 1 (1772)\n\nVocal music\n-------------\n\n* \"Ernestine\" (1777), opera\n* \"La Partie de Chasse\" (1778), opera\n* \"L'Amant anonyme\" (1780), opera\n\nDubious works\n----------------\n\nThere are several works attributed to Saint-Georges that are of dubious authenticity, including several symphonies and chamber music works.\n\nDiscography\n------------\n\nSymphonies concertantes\n-------------------------\n\n* Symphonie concertante in G major, Op. 13 (1781), performed by the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment (1995)\n* Symphonie concertante in A major, Op. 14 (1782), performed by the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment (1996)\n\nSymphonies\n------------\n\n* Symphony in G major, Op. 11, No. 1 (1779), performed by the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment (1997)\n* Symphony in D major, Op. 11, No. 2 (1780), performed by the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment (1998)\n\nViolin concertos\n-----------------\n\n* Violin Concerto in D major, Op. 2, No. 1 (1773), performed by the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment (1999)\n* Violin Concerto in A major, Op. 2, No. 2 (1774), performed by the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment (2000)\n\nChamber music\n--------------\n\n* Violin Sonata in A major, Op. 1, No. 1 (1772), performed by the Quatuor Mosaïques (2001)\n* Violin Sonata in D major, Op. 1, No. 2 (1773), performed by the Quatuor Mosaïques (2002)\n\nMiscellaneous\n--------------\n\n* \"Ernestine\" (1777), opera, performed by the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment (2003)\n* \"La Partie de Chasse\" (1778), opera, performed by the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment (2004)\n\nIn popular culture\n-------------------\n\nSaint-Georges has been the subject of several books, films, and plays, including the novel \"Chevalier\" by Michaela Coel (2022).\n\nFootnotes\n----------\n\n1.

The season started on 13 August 2021 and concluded on 22 May 2022.\n\n# Summary\n\nThe 2021–22 Premier League season was marked by several key events that shaped the campaign.\n\n## The race for first place\n\nThe title race was highly competitive, with Manchester City and Liverpool emerging as the top two contenders. Manchester City, led by manager Pep Guardiola, were seeking to win their fourth title in five years, while Liverpool, under Jürgen Klopp, were looking to claim their second title in three years. The two teams were neck and neck for much of the season, with Manchester City eventually edging out Liverpool by a single point.\n\n## Newcastle takeover\n\nIn October 2021, Newcastle United was taken over by a consortium backed by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. The takeover led to a significant increase in the club's financial resources, and they were able to make several high-profile signings in the January transfer window.\n\n## COVID-19 outbreaks force postponements\n\nThe season was disrupted by several COVID-19 outbreaks, which led to the postponement of numerous matches. The outbreaks were particularly severe in December 2021, with several teams experiencing significant numbers of positive cases.\n\n## Abramovich sanctions\n\nIn March 2022, Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich was sanctioned by the UK government due to his alleged ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The sanctions had a significant impact on Chelsea, who were forced to operate under a special license that restricted their ability to sign new players or sell tickets.\n\n## Final day climax\n\nThe final day of the season was marked by a dramatic climax, as Manchester City came from behind to defeat Aston Villa 3-2 and win the title. Liverpool, who had been leading the league for much of the day, ultimately finished one point behind Manchester City.\n\n### Title\n\nManchester City won the title with 93 points, one point ahead of Liverpool.\n\n### Relegation\n\nThe three teams that were relegated to the EFL Championship were Norwich City, Watford, and Everton.\n\n### Champions League, Europa League and Conference League spots\n\nThe top four teams in the league qualified for the Champions League, while the fifth and sixth-placed teams qualified for the Europa League. The seventh-placed team, West Ham United, qualified for the Europa Conference League.\n\n## Other teams\n\nSeveral other teams had notable seasons, including Chelsea, who finished third despite the challenges posed by the Abramovich sanctions. Tottenham Hotspur finished fourth, while Arsenal finished fifth. Manchester United finished sixth, but qualified for the Europa League due to their victory in the UEFA Europa League.\n\n# Teams\n\n## Stadiums and locations\n\n| Team | Location | Stadium | Capacity

The coup marked the end of Bongo's 14-year rule and led to the establishment of a new government in the country.\n\n# Background\n\nGabon, a small country located in Central Africa, had been ruled by the Bongo family for over five decades. Omar Bongo Ondimba, Ali's father, had been president of the country from 1967 until his death in 2009. Ali Bongo Ondimba succeeded his father as president and had been in power since 2009.\n\n## 2023 Elections\n\nIn 2023, Gabon was scheduled to hold presidential elections, which were seen as a test of Bongo's popularity. However, the elections were marred by controversy and opposition claims of irregularities. Bongo's main challenger, Jean Ping, a former African Union Commission chairman, had been a vocal critic of the government and had accused Bongo of rigging the elections. The elections were held on August 26, 2023, and Bongo was declared the winner by the electoral commission. However, Ping and other opposition candidates disputed the results, claiming that the elections had been rigged.\n\n# Coup\n\nOn August 30, 2023, a group of military officers, led by General Brice Oligui Nguema, announced that they had taken control of the government. The military officers claimed that they had intervened to prevent a civil war and to restore stability in the country.\n\n## Events\n\nThe coup began early in the morning, when a group of soldiers stormed the presidential palace and took control of key government buildings. The soldiers also took control of the national radio and television stations, which were used to broadcast a statement announcing the coup.\n\nGeneral Oligui, a former chief of staff of the Gabonese army, appeared on television to announce the coup. He claimed that the military had intervened to prevent a civil war and to restore stability in the country. He also announced the establishment of a transitional government, which would be headed by a civilian president.\n\n## Arrests of Ali Bongo and other officials\n\nFollowing the coup, Ali Bongo Ondimba and several other government officials were arrested. Bongo was taken into custody by the military and was held at a military base on the outskirts of the capital city, Libreville.\n\nOther officials who were arrested included the prime minister, Raymond Ndong Sima, and the interior minister, Guy-Bertrand Mapangou. The officials were accused of corruption and abuse of power.\n\n## Proclamation of Brice Oligui as interim president\n\nOn August 31, 2023, General Oligui was proclaimed interim president of Gabon by the military. Oligui, a former chief of staff of the Gabonese army, had been a key player in the coup. He promised to restore stability in the country and to hold elections within a year.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe coup led to a period of uncertainty in Gabon, with many people wondering what the future held for the country.\n\n## Formation of a new government\n\nFollowing the coup, a new government was formed, with General Oligui as interim president. The government was made up of military officers and civilians, who were tasked with restoring stability in the country.\n\nThe new government promised to hold elections within a year and to restore democracy in the country. However, many people were skeptical about the government's intentions, and there were fears that the military would try to hold onto power.\n\n## Bongo's release\n\nOn September 10, 2023, Ali Bongo Ondimba was released from custody. Bongo, who had been held at a military base, was released after a meeting with General Oligui.\n\nBongo was given permission to leave the country, and he flew to Morocco, where he was met by his family. The release of Bongo was seen as a positive step, but many people were still concerned about the future of the country.\n\n# Reactions\n\nThe coup was met with a mixture of reactions, both domestically and internationally.\n\n## Domestic\n\nMany Gabonese people welcomed the coup, seeing it as an opportunity for change. However, others were concerned about the future of the country and the intentions of the military.\n\nThe opposition parties, who had been critical of Bongo's government, welcomed the coup. They saw it as an opportunity to bring about change and to restore democracy in the country.\n\n## International\n\nThe international community was divided in its response to the coup. Some countries, such as France and the United States, condemned the coup and called for the restoration of democracy.\n\nOther countries, such as China and Russia, were more muted in their response. They called for calm and stability in the country, but did not condemn the coup.\n\nThe African Union and the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS) condemned the coup and called for the restoration of democracy in the country.\n\n# See also\n\n* 2016 Gabonese presidential election\n* 2019 Gabonese legislative election\n* 2023 Gabonese presidential election\n* List of heads of state of Gabon\n\n# References\n\n# External links\n\nNote: This article is a neutral, encyclopedic-style article, and does not include any citations or references.

The shooting resulted in the deaths of three students and injuries to five others.\n\n# Shootings\n\nThe shooting occurred around 8:00 p.m. local time at two locations on the MSU campus: Berkey Hall and the MSU Student Union building. The gunman, who was later identified as Anthony Dwayne McRae, opened fire in the classrooms and hallways of Berkey Hall, before moving to the MSU Student Union building, where he continued to shoot. The shooting lasted for approximately 30 minutes, during which time the university's emergency alert system was activated, warning students and staff to seek shelter.\n\n# Victims\n\nThree students were killed in the shooting: Arielle Anderson, a 19-year-old sophomore; Alexandria Verner, a 20-year-old junior; and Brian Fraser, a 20-year-old junior. Five other students were injured, including three who were in critical condition. The victims were all students at MSU, and the shooting was not believed to be targeted at any specific individual or group.\n\n## Aftermath\n\nFollowing the shooting, the MSU campus was placed on lockdown, and students and staff were advised to remain in place until the all-clear was given. The university's crisis management team was activated, and emergency responders, including police and medical personnel, were dispatched to the scene. The investigation into the shooting was led by the Michigan State Police, with assistance from the FBI and other law enforcement agencies.\n\n# Perpetrator\n\nAnthony Dwayne McRae, a 43-year-old resident of Lansing, Michigan, was identified as the shooter. McRae had no known connections to MSU or the victims. He was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in a nearby parking garage, approximately two hours after the shooting began. McRae had a history of mental health issues and had been known to law enforcement prior to the shooting.\n\n## Aftermath\n\nIn the days following the shooting, the MSU community came together to mourn the loss of the victims and support those affected by the tragedy. The university provided counseling services and other forms of support to students and staff.\n\n# Aftermath\n\n## Memorials and Vigils\n\nMemorials and vigils were held on the MSU campus and in the surrounding community to honor the victims of the shooting. Thousands of students, staff, and community members attended the events, which included candlelight vigils, prayer services, and moments of silence.\n\n## Gun Violence Protest\n\nA protest against gun violence was held on the MSU campus, with hundreds of students and community members in attendance. The protest called for stricter gun control laws and greater action to prevent mass shootings.\n\n## Permanent Memorial\n\nA permanent memorial to the victims of the shooting was established on the MSU campus. The memorial, which includes a plaque and a garden, serves as a reminder of the lives lost and the impact of the tragedy on the MSU community.\n\n## Lawsuits\n\nLawsuits were filed against MSU and other parties in connection with the shooting. The lawsuits alleged that the university had failed to provide adequate security and had not taken sufficient steps to prevent the shooting.\n\n# Responses\n\n## Gun Control Debate\n\nThe shooting reignited the debate over gun control laws in the United States. Advocates for stricter gun control laws pointed to the MSU shooting as an example of the need for greater regulation of firearms, while opponents argued that such laws would infringe on Second Amendment rights.\n\n## Connections to Other Shootings\n\nThe MSU shooting was compared to other recent mass shootings in the United States, including the 2022 Robb Elementary School shooting and the 2022 Uvalde shooting. The shootings highlighted the ongoing concern over gun violence in the United States and the need for greater action to prevent such tragedies.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of mass shootings in the United States\n* Gun violence in the United States\n* Mass shootings in the United States\n* School shootings in the United States", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Michigan_State_University_shooting\" following this outline:\n\n#Shootings\n#Victims\n##Aftermath\n#Perpetrator\n#Aftermath\n##Memorials and vigils\n##Gun violence protest\n##Permanent memorial\n##Lawsuits\n#Responses\n##Gun control debate\n##Connections to other shootings\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He is one of the most celebrated and influential writers of his generation, known for his complex and often provocative novels that blend elements of magical realism, historical fiction, and postcolonial critique. Rushdie's works have been translated into numerous languages and have received widespread critical acclaim, as well as controversy and even violence.\n\n#Early life and education\n\nSalman Rushdie was born on June 19, 1947, in Bombay (now Mumbai), India, to Anis Ahmed Rushdie and Negin Bhatt. His father was a lawyer and a devout Muslim, while his mother was a teacher and a secularist. Rushdie's family was part of the Kashmiri Muslim community, and he was raised in a culturally and linguistically diverse environment. He was the eldest of four children, and his parents encouraged his love of literature and learning from an early age.\n\nRushdie attended the Cathedral and John Connon School in Bombay before moving to England to study at King's College, Cambridge. He earned a degree in history from Cambridge in 1968 and later earned a master's degree in philosophy from the University of East Anglia. After completing his education, Rushdie worked as a copywriter in London and began writing fiction in his spare time.\n\n#Career\n\n##Copywriter\n\nRushdie worked as a copywriter in London from 1970 to 1980, writing advertising copy for various agencies. During this period, he also began writing fiction and published several short stories in literary magazines.\n\n##Literary works\n\n###Early works and literary breakthrough, 1975–1987\n\nRushdie's first novel, \"Grimus,\" was published in 1975 to mixed reviews. However, his second novel, \"Midnight's Children,\" published in 1981, received widespread critical acclaim and established him as a major literary talent. The novel won the Booker Prize in 1981 and the James Tait Black Memorial Prize in 1982. Rushdie's subsequent novels, \"Shame\" (1983) and \"The Satanic Verses\" (1988), solidified his reputation as a bold and innovative writer.\n\n###The Satanic Verses and Haroun and the Sea of Stories, 1988–1990\n\n\"The Satanic Verses\" was published in 1988 and sparked widespread controversy and outrage in the Muslim world. The novel was seen as blasphemous and insulting to Islam, and Rushdie received death threats and a fatwa from Ayatollah Khomeini, the Supreme Leader of Iran. The controversy surrounding the novel led to Rushdie going into hiding for several years. During this period, he wrote \"Haroun and the Sea of Stories\" (1990), a children's novel that explores themes of storytelling and identity.\n\n###Further works, 1990s–2000s\n\nRushdie continued to write prolifically throughout the 1990s and 2000s, publishing novels such as \"The Moor's Last Sigh\" (1995), \"The Ground Beneath Her Feet\" (1999), and \"Fury\" (2001). His nonfiction works, including \"Imaginary Homelands\" (1991) and \"Step Across This Line\" (2002), explored themes of identity, culture, and politics.\n\n###Later works, novels, and essays, 2015–2024\n\nRushdie's more recent works include the novels \"Two Years Eight Months and Twenty-Eight Nights\" (2015), \"The Golden House\" (2017), and \"Quichotte\" (2019). His essays and nonfiction works, such as \"Language & Silence\" (2019) and \"Victory City\" (2023), continue to explore themes of language, culture, and politics.\n\n##Critical reception\n\nRushdie's works have received widespread critical acclaim for their complex and nuanced exploration of themes such as identity, culture, and politics. However, his works have also been criticized for their perceived blasphemy and insults to Islam. The controversy surrounding \"The Satanic Verses\" led to Rushdie going into hiding for several years and receiving a fatwa from Ayatollah Khomeini.\n\n##Academic and other activities\n\nRushdie has taught at various universities, including the University of East Anglia and Emory University. He has also been a fellow at the Royal Society of Literature and a president of the PEN American Center. Rushdie has been involved in various human rights and freedom of expression initiatives, including the defense of persecuted writers and the promotion of literary freedom.\n\n##Film and television\n\nRushdie's works have been adapted into films and television series, including the 1996 film \"Midnight's Children\" and the 2012 television series \"The Reluctant Fundamentalist.\" Rushdie has also written screenplays and has been involved in various film and television projects.\n\n#The Satanic Verses and the fatwā\n\n##Failed assassination attempt (1989)\n\nIn 1989, Rushdie survived an assassination attempt by a group of Iranian militants.

As the wife of a prominent statesman, Clarissa Eden played an important role in British politics and society during the mid-20th century.\n\n#Early life\n\nClarissa Eden was born on June 28, 1920, into a family of minor nobility. Her early life was marked by a series of moves between different parts of Europe, which would later shape her cosmopolitan outlook and love of travel.\n\n##Paris, Tuscany and London (1937–1939)\n\nIn the late 1930s, Clarissa's family moved to Paris, where she developed a deep appreciation for French culture and language. The family later relocated to Tuscany, Italy, where Clarissa honed her skills in Italian and developed a love for the region's art, architecture, and history. In 1939, the family returned to London, where Clarissa would spend much of her adult life.\n\n##Second World War: Oxford and the Foreign Office\n\nDuring World War II, Clarissa studied at Oxford University, where she developed a strong interest in politics and international relations. After completing her studies, she worked at the Foreign Office, where she gained valuable experience in the world of diplomacy and statecraft.\n\n##Post-war\n\nIn the aftermath of the war, Clarissa continued to work in the Foreign Office, where she played a small role in shaping British foreign policy. Her experiences during this period would later inform her role as the wife of a prominent politician.\n\n#2007 memoir\n\nIn 2007, Clarissa Eden published a memoir, \"A Memoir: From Churchill to Eden\", which offered a unique insight into her life and experiences as the wife of a British Prime Minister. The book provides a candid and introspective look at her relationships, her role in politics, and her observations on the major events of the 20th century.\n\n#Friends and acquaintances\n\nThroughout her life, Clarissa Eden formed close relationships with many notable figures, including politicians, artists, and intellectuals.\n\n##Early admirers\n\nOne of Clarissa's earliest admirers was the poet and novelist, Harold Nicolson. Nicolson, who was a close friend of the Eden family, often sought Clarissa's counsel and advice on matters of politics and literature.\n\n##Other friends\n\nClarissa also formed close friendships with other notable figures, including the artist, Graham Sutherland, and the writer, Evelyn Waugh. These relationships reflect her love of art, literature, and culture, and demonstrate her ability to form connections with people from a wide range of backgrounds and disciplines.\n\n#Relationship with Anthony Eden\n\nClarissa's most significant relationship, however, was with Anthony Eden, whom she married in 1952.\n\n##Winston Churchill and the wartime link\n\nThe connection between Clarissa and Anthony Eden was facilitated by Winston Churchill, who had served as Prime Minister during World War II. Churchill, who was a close friend and mentor to Eden, had also known Clarissa's family for many years. The wartime link between Churchill, Eden, and Clarissa's family would later play a significant role in shaping her relationship with Eden.\n\n##Marriage to Eden\n\nClarissa and Anthony Eden married in 1952, when Eden was serving as Foreign Secretary. The marriage was widely seen as a union between two people from different social backgrounds, and was the subject of much speculation and comment in the press.\n\n###Attitudes to the marriage\n\nSome observers saw the marriage as a clever move by Eden to consolidate his position within the Conservative Party. Others viewed it as a love match between two people who shared a deep passion for politics and culture.\n\n###Married life\n\nRegardless of the motivations behind the marriage, Clarissa and Anthony Eden formed a close and supportive partnership. Clarissa played an important role in Eden's political career, serving as his hostess and confidante.\n\n#Eden's premiership\n\nIn 1955, Anthony Eden succeeded Winston Churchill as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Clarissa played a key role in Eden's premiership, serving as the chatelaine of Downing Street and Chequers.\n\n##Chatelaine at Downing Street and Chequers\n\nAs the wife of the Prime Minister, Clarissa was responsible for hosting state visits, receptions, and other official events. She proved to be a skilled and gracious hostess, earning praise from diplomats and politicians alike.\n\n##Suez Crisis\n\nIn 1956, Eden's government became embroiled in the Suez Crisis, a major international conflict that would ultimately lead to Eden's downfall.\n\n###\"The Suez Canal flowing through my drawing room\"\n\nClarissa later described the Suez Crisis as \"the Suez Canal flowing through my drawing room\", reflecting the intense pressure and scrutiny that she and Eden faced during this period.\n\n##Political influence\n\nClarissa played a significant role in shaping Eden's response to the Suez Crisis, urging him to adopt a more cautious approach. However, her influence was ultimately limited by Eden's own convictions and the pressure from other advisors.\n\n##Protective influence\n\nDespite her limited influence on policy, Clarissa played a protective role in Eden's life, shielding him from the intense criticism and scrutiny that he faced during the Suez Crisis.\n\n##Aftermath of Suez\n\nIn the aftermath of the Suez Crisis, Eden's government faced intense criticism and opposition. The crisis ultimately led to Eden's resignation as Prime Minister in January 1957.\n\n###Goldeneye\n\nDuring this period, Clarissa and Eden retreated to Goldeneye, their home in Jamaica, where they sought to escape the intense scrutiny and pressure of British politics.\n\n###Eden's resignation\n\nEden's resignation marked the end of his premiership and the beginning of a period of retirement and reflection.\n\n#Eden's retirement and death\n\nAfter his resignation, Eden retired from politics and devoted himself to writing and gardening. He died in 1977, leaving Clarissa a widow.\n\n#Widowhood\n\nClarissa's widowhood was marked by a period of reflection and reminiscence. She continued to write and publish, producing several books and articles on politics, history, and culture.\n\n##Longevity\n\nClarissa Eden lived a long and active life, passing away in 2021 at the age of 101. Her longevity allowed her to reflect on her experiences and observations, providing a unique insight into the major events of the 20th century.\n\n#In popular culture\n\nClarissa Eden has appeared in several films, television shows, and books, often as a minor character or cameo. Her life and experiences have also been the subject of several documentaries and biographies.\n\n#Arms\n\nThe arms of Clarissa Eden, Countess of Avon, feature a stylized representation of the Eden family crest, reflecting her marriage to Anthony Eden and her role as a member of the British nobility.\n\n#References\n\n##Notes\n\n##Citations\n\n##Bibliography\n\n#External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Clarissa_Eden\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n##Paris, Tuscany and London (1937–1939)\n##Second World War: Oxford and the Foreign Office\n##Post-war\n#2007 memoir\n#Friends and acquaintances\n##Early admirers\n##Other friends\n#Relationship with Anthony Eden\n##Winston Churchill and the wartime link\n##Marriage to Eden\n###Attitudes to the marriage\n###Married life\n#Eden's premiership\n##Chatelaine at Downing Street and Chequers\n##Suez Crisis\n###\"The Suez Canal flowing through my drawing room\"\n##Political influence\n##Protective influence\n##Aftermath of Suez\n###Goldeneye\n###Eden's resignation\n#Eden's retirement and death\n#Widowhood\n##Longevity\n#In popular culture\n#Arms\n#References\n##Notes\n##Citations\n##Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The earthquake was felt across several provinces, with the greatest impact in the northern regions of Abra, Ilocos Sur, and Benguet.\n\n# Earthquake\n\n## Characteristics\n\nThe 2022 Luzon earthquake occurred at 8:43 AM local time, with its epicenter located in the town of Lagangilang, Abra, approximately 11 kilometers northwest of the provincial capital, Bangued. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) reported the earthquake's magnitude as 7.0 on the moment magnitude scale (Mw), while the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) recorded a magnitude of 7.3. The earthquake's focal depth was estimated at 17 kilometers.\n\n## Aftershocks\n\nFollowing the main shock, numerous aftershocks were recorded, with some exceeding magnitude 5.0. The strongest aftershock, with a magnitude of 5.4, occurred approximately 30 minutes after the main shock. The aftershocks continued for several days, with some still being felt weeks after the initial earthquake.\n\n## Intensity\n\nThe earthquake's intensity was reported as VIII (Very Destructive) on the PHIVOLCS Earthquake Intensity Scale (PEIS), with some areas experiencing even higher intensities. In Abra, where the epicenter was located, the intensity was reported as IX (Destructive), while in Ilocos Sur and Benguet, the intensity was reported as VIII (Very Destructive).\n\n## Tsunami\n\nDespite the earthquake's proximity to the coast, no tsunami was triggered. The Philippine Tsunami Warning System issued a tsunami advisory, but it was later cancelled as no tsunami waves were detected.\n\n## Liquefaction\n\nIn some areas, particularly in Abra and Ilocos Sur, liquefaction occurred, resulting in the formation of sand boils and mud volcanoes. Liquefaction is a phenomenon where shaking causes water-saturated soil to lose its strength, leading to the formation of unstable ground.\n\n# Response\n\n## International aid\n\nThe international community provided assistance to the affected areas, with several countries offering aid and support. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) activated the international humanitarian response, with various agencies providing support in areas such as search and rescue, shelter, and food.\n\n# Impact\n\n## Abra\n\nAbra was the hardest-hit province, with widespread destruction reported in the capital, Bangued, and surrounding areas. The province's infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and buildings, suffered significant damage. The provincial government reported over 1,000 homes destroyed and thousands more damaged.\n\n## Baguio\n\nIn Baguio, the summer capital of the Philippines, several buildings and structures were damaged, including the historic Baguio Cathedral. The city's infrastructure, including roads and bridges, also suffered damage.\n\n## Ilocos Sur\n\nIlocos Sur was also severely affected, with widespread destruction reported in the province's capital, Vigan. The province's historic town center, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, suffered significant damage, with several buildings and structures destroyed or damaged.\n\n## Metro Manila\n\nWhile Metro Manila was not directly affected by the earthquake, several buildings and structures in the capital region suffered damage. The Ninoy Aquino International Airport was temporarily closed due to damage to the terminal building.\n\n## Elsewhere\n\nOther provinces, including La Union, Pangasinan, and Nueva Ecija, also reported damage and casualties. The earthquake's impact was felt as far as the Bicol Region in the eastern Philippines.\n\n# Gallery\n\n[Insert images of the earthquake's impact]\n\n# See also\n\n* List of earthquakes in the Philippines\n* 1990 Luzon earthquake\n* 2019 Luzon earthquake\n\n# References\n\n[Note: References are not included as per the requirements]\n\n# External links\n\n[Note: External links are not included as per the requirements]", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Luzon_earthquake\" following this outline:\n\n#Earthquake\n##Characteristics\n##Aftershocks\n##Intensity\n##Tsunami\n##Liquefaction\n#Response\n##International aid\n#Impact\n##Abra\n##Baguio\n##Ilocos Sur\n##Metro Manila\n##Elsewhere\n#Gallery\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The conflict escalated rapidly, resulting in significant human suffering, displacement of civilians, and a renewed crisis in the region.\n\n#Background\n\nNagorno-Karabakh is a disputed territory in the South Caucasus region, internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan but predominantly inhabited by ethnic Armenians. The region has been the subject of a decades-long conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, with the self-proclaimed Republic of Artsakh declaring independence in 1991. A ceasefire agreement was signed in 1994, but the conflict remained unresolved, with periodic outbreaks of violence.\n\n#Prelude\n\nIn the months leading up to the 2023 offensive, tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan had been escalating. Azerbaijan had been implementing a blockade of the Lachin corridor, the only road connecting Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia, which had led to shortages of food, medicine, and other essential supplies in the region. Armenia had accused Azerbaijan of attempting to strangle the region economically.\n\n#Offensive\n\n##19 September\n\nOn September 19, 2023, Azerbaijan launched a large-scale military operation against Nagorno-Karabakh, targeting military positions, infrastructure, and civilian areas. The Azerbaijani military used artillery, drones, and aircraft to bombard the region, causing widespread destruction and displacement of civilians. The Republic of Artsakh's defense forces responded with counterattacks, but were vastly outgunned and outmanned.\n\n##20 September\n\nBy September 20, Azerbaijani forces had made significant gains, capturing several key towns and villages in the region. The Republic of Artsakh's government announced that it was relocating its administrative bodies to the town of Stepanakert, the de facto capital of the region. The Armenian government declared martial law and mobilized its military reserves in response to the Azerbaijani offensive.\n\n#Aftermath\n\n##Flight of Armenians from Nagorno-Karabakh\n\nAs the Azerbaijani military advanced, thousands of Armenians fled their homes in Nagorno-Karabakh, seeking refuge in Armenia. The exodus was chaotic, with many civilians forced to abandon their belongings and livelihoods. The Armenian government set up temporary shelters and aid centers to receive the displaced civilians.\n\n##Arrests of Artsakhi officials\n\nIn the aftermath of the offensive, Azerbaijani authorities arrested several high-ranking officials of the Republic of Artsakh, including the president and prime minister. The arrests were widely condemned by the international community, which called for the officials' immediate release.\n\n##Negotiations and dissolution of Artsakh\n\nFollowing the Azerbaijani offensive, the Republic of Artsakh's government announced that it was willing to engage in negotiations with Azerbaijan to resolve the conflict. However, the talks were complicated by the arrest of Artsakhi officials and the Azerbaijani military's continued presence in the region. On September 29, the Republic of Artsakh's parliament voted to dissolve the self-proclaimed republic, paving the way for Azerbaijan to assume control over the region.\n\n##Ceasefire violations\n\nDespite the dissolution of the Republic of Artsakh, ceasefire violations continued to occur in the region. Both Armenia and Azerbaijan accused each other of violating the terms of the ceasefire agreement, which had been brokered by Russia.\n\n##Humanitarian aid\n\nThe international community responded to the humanitarian crisis in Nagorno-Karabakh by providing aid to affected civilians.

The coalition consists of several parties, including La France Insoumise, the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, the Greens, and others. The NUPES aims to challenge the dominance of the center-right and right-wing parties in French politics and promote a more progressive and environmentally conscious agenda.\n\n# History\n\n## Formation\n\nThe New Ecological and Social People's Union was formed in May 2022, following the presidential election, in which the left-wing parties performed poorly. La France Insoumise, led by Jean-Luc Mélenchon, took the initiative to create a broad alliance of left-wing parties to compete in the upcoming legislative election. The Socialist Party, the Communist Party, the Greens, and other smaller parties agreed to join the coalition, with the goal of winning a majority of seats in the National Assembly.\n\n## Expansion\n\nIn the weeks following its formation, the NUPES expanded to include several other parties and organizations. The coalition welcomed the Radical Party of the Left, the New Anticapitalist Party, and the Movement of Progressives, among others. The NUPES also established ties with various social movements and trade unions, seeking to build a broad base of support among progressive voters.\n\n## 2022 French legislative election\n\nThe NUPES competed in the 2022 French legislative election, which took place in June of that year. The coalition presented a unified list of candidates in each constituency, with the goal of winning a majority of seats in the National Assembly. The NUPES campaigned on a platform of social and economic reform, environmental protection, and democratic renewal.\n\n## Electoral results and aftermath\n\nThe NUPES won 131 seats in the National Assembly, making it the largest opposition group in the legislature. Although the coalition fell short of its goal of winning a majority, it achieved a significant breakthrough, particularly in urban areas and among younger voters. The NUPES's strong showing marked a turning point in French politics, as the left-wing parties regained momentum and began to challenge the dominance of the center-right and right-wing parties.\n\n## Election of René Pilato\n\nIn July 2022, the NUPES elected René Pilato as its leader in the National Assembly. Pilato, a member of La France Insoumise, became the first leader of the NUPES in the legislature. His election marked a new era of cooperation and unity among the left-wing parties, as they sought to work together to promote their shared values and policies.\n\n## Quatennens Affair\n\nIn September 2022, the NUPES was embroiled in controversy when one of its deputies, Adrien Quatennens, was accused of domestic violence. Quatennens, a member of La France Insoumise, denied the allegations but ultimately resigned from his position as a deputy. The incident sparked a wider debate about the NUPES's handling of internal conflicts and its commitment to promoting social justice and equality.\n\n## Bayou Affair\n\nIn October 2022, the NUPES was involved in another controversy when one of its senators, Pierre Bayou, was accused of embezzlement. Bayou, a member of the Socialist Party, denied the allegations but ultimately resigned from his position as a senator. The incident highlighted the challenges facing the NUPES as it sought to maintain its integrity and credibility in the face of internal conflicts and scandals.\n\n## Tensions with the Communist Party\n\nTensions between the NUPES and the Communist Party (PCF) emerged in late 2022, as the two parties disagreed over issues such as economic policy and the role of the state. The PCF, which had historically been a key player on the French left, felt marginalized within the NUPES and began to distance itself from the coalition. The tensions between the NUPES and the PCF highlighted the challenges of building a broad and cohesive alliance of left-wing parties.\n\n## Socialist infighting and election of Martine Froger\n\nIn November 2022, the Socialist Party (PS) was embroiled in internal conflict, as rival factions vied for control of the party. The PS ultimately elected Martine Froger as its leader, marking a shift to the left within the party. The election of Froger highlighted the ongoing evolution of the PS and its relationship with the NUPES, as the party sought to reassert its influence on the French left.\n\n## Socialist Party suspension\n\nIn December 2022, the NUPES suspended the Socialist Party from its ranks, citing disagreements over policy and strategy. The suspension marked a significant rift within the coalition, as the PS had been a key player in the NUPES since its formation. The incident highlighted the challenges facing the NUPES as it sought to maintain its unity and cohesion in the face of internal conflicts and disagreements.\n\n# Members\n\nThe NUPES consists of several parties and organizations, including:\n\n* La France Insoumise\n* The Socialist Party\n* The Communist Party\n* The Greens\n* The Radical Party of the Left\n* The New Anticapitalist Party\n* The Movement of Progressives\n\n## Former members\n\n* The Socialist Party (suspended in December 2022)\n\n# Candidates 2022\n\nThe NUPES presented a unified list of candidates in each constituency in the 2022 French legislative election.\n\n## Breakdown by constituency\n\nThe NUPES presented candidates in 577 constituencies across France.\n\n## Dissident candidates\n\nSeveral dissident candidates ran against the NUPES in the 2022 French legislative election, including candidates from the Socialist Party and the Communist Party.\n\n# Ideology and platform\n\nThe NUPES is a left-wing alliance that advocates for social and economic reform, environmental protection, and democratic renewal. The coalition's platform includes policies such as:\n\n* Increasing the minimum wage and implementing a 32-hour workweek\n* Implementing a wealth tax and increasing corporate taxation\n* Investing in renewable energy and reducing carbon emissions\n* Strengthening labor unions and promoting collective bargaining\n* Implementing a more progressive tax system and reducing income inequality\n* Promoting social justice and equality, particularly for marginalized communities\n\n# Electoral history\n\n## Legislative elections\n\n* 2022 French legislative election: 131 seats (22.7% of the total)\n\n# Reactions\n\nThe formation of the NUPES has sparked a range of reactions across the French political spectrum.\n\n## PS majority and social-democratic left\n\nThe Socialist Party and other social-democratic parties have welcomed the NUPES as a necessary step towards rebuilding the French left.\n\n## PS minority and opposition\n\nSome Socialist Party members have expressed reservations about the NUPES, citing concerns about the coalition's radicalism and the potential for conflict with other parties.\n\n## Extra-parliamentary left\n\nThe extra-parliamentary left, including social movements and trade unions, has generally welcomed the NUPES as a positive development for the French left.\n\n## Presidential majority\n\nThe presidential majority, consisting of the center-right and right-wing parties, has criticized the NUPES as a threat to stability and economic growth.\n\n# See also\n\n* French politics\n* Left-wing politics in France\n* Socialist Party (France)\n* Communist Party (France)\n* La France Insoumise\n* Greens (France)\n\n# Notes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"New_Ecological_and_Social_People's_Union\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Formation\n##Expansion\n##2022 French legislative election\n##Electoral results and aftermath\n##Election of René Pilato\n##Quatennens Affair\n##Bayou Affair\n##Tensions with the Communist Party\n##Socialist infighting and election of Martine Froger\n##Socialist Party suspension\n#Members\n##Former members\n#Candidates 2022\n##Breakdown by constituency\n##Dissident candidates\n#Ideology and platform\n#Electoral history\n##Legislative elections\n#Reactions\n##PS majority and social-democratic left\n##PS minority and opposition\n##Extra-parliamentary left\n##Presidential majority\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It was one of the deadliest crowd disasters in South Korean history, resulting in the deaths of 158 people and injuring many more. The incident occurred during Halloween celebrations, which drew large crowds to the area.\n\n# Background\n\n## History of the district\n\nItaewon is a popular district in Seoul, known for its vibrant nightlife, shopping, and dining scene. The area has a long history of attracting foreigners and locals alike, with many bars, clubs, and restaurants catering to a diverse crowd. The district has been a hub for social gatherings and celebrations, including Halloween parties, which have become increasingly popular in recent years.\n\n## Layout of the area\n\nThe area where the crowd crush occurred is a narrow, sloping street with multiple alleys and side streets. The street is lined with bars, clubs, and restaurants, with many entrances and exits that can lead to congestion. The area is also surrounded by tall buildings, which can create a funnel effect, directing crowds into a smaller space.\n\n# Conditions before the disaster\n\n## Lack of government preparation\n\nIn the days leading up to the Halloween celebrations, concerns were raised about the potential for overcrowding and safety risks in the Itaewon area. However, the government and local authorities failed to take adequate measures to address these concerns. There were no crowd control barriers, no clear emergency response plan, and no effective communication system in place to manage the large crowds.\n\n# Disaster\n\nOn the evening of October 29, 2022, a large crowd of people gathered in the Itaewon area to celebrate Halloween. The crowd grew rapidly, and by around 10:00 p.m., the streets were packed with people. Suddenly, a surge of people pushed forward, causing a crowd collapse that resulted in widespread panic and chaos. Many people were trapped, unable to move or escape, and were crushed or trampled by the crowd.\n\n# Immediate emergency response\n\nEmergency services were quickly overwhelmed by the scale of the disaster. Ambulances and rescue teams struggled to reach the scene, and many people were left to fend for themselves. Bystanders and witnesses attempted to provide assistance, but their efforts were often hindered by the sheer number of people in need of help.\n\n# Victims\n\n## Identification of victims\n\nThe process of identifying the victims was slow and challenging, with many people unable to be identified immediately. The authorities used various methods, including DNA analysis, fingerprints, and facial recognition, to identify the victims.\n\n## Mental health\n\nThe disaster had a significant impact on the mental health of those who were directly affected, including survivors, witnesses, and the families of the victims. Many people reported experiencing anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the aftermath of the disaster.\n\n## Publication of the names of the fatalities\n\nThe names of the victims were gradually released to the public, with the authorities providing regular updates on the number of fatalities and the progress of the identification process.\n\n# Government response\n\n## Immediate response\n\nThe government responded quickly to the disaster, with the president and other senior officials visiting the scene and offering condolences to the families of the victims. However, the response was widely criticized for being inadequate and ineffective.\n\n## Investigation\n\nAn investigation into the disaster was launched immediately, with the authorities seeking to identify the causes of the crowd crush and to determine who was responsible. The investigation was led by the police, with assistance from other agencies, including the fire department and the emergency services.\n\n## Parliamentary inquiry\n\nA parliamentary inquiry was established to examine the government's response to the disaster and to identify measures to prevent similar incidents in the future. The inquiry heard testimony from witnesses, including survivors, emergency responders, and government officials.\n\n# Criticism and protests\n\n## Protests\n\nProtests were held in the aftermath of the disaster, with many people expressing anger and frustration at the government's response. The protests were largely peaceful, but there were some clashes between protesters and police.\n\n## Criticisms of the investigation\n\nThe investigation was criticized for being slow and ineffective, with many people questioning the authorities' ability to identify the causes of the disaster and to hold those responsible accountable.\n\n## Criticisms of the government\n\nThe government was widely criticized for its response to the disaster, with many people accusing officials of being incompetent and ineffective. The government was also criticized for its failure to take adequate measures to prevent the disaster, despite warnings and concerns raised in the days leading up to the Halloween celebrations.\n\n# Memorials\n\n## Mourning and memorial sites\n\nMourning and memorial sites were established in the Itaewon area, with many people visiting to pay their respects to the victims. The sites included a large memorial altar, where people could leave flowers, candles, and other tributes.\n\n## Buddhist orders\n\nBuddhist orders and other religious groups played an important role in providing support and comfort to those affected by the disaster. Many people turned to religion in the aftermath of the tragedy, seeking solace and guidance.\n\n# International response\n\nThe international community responded to the disaster with expressions of condolence and support.

The suspensions, which affected numerous high-profile accounts, sparked widespread controversy and debate about Twitter's moderation policies and the role of the platform's owner, Elon Musk.\n\n#Background\n\nIn October 2022, Elon Musk completed his acquisition of Twitter, taking the company private. Following the acquisition, Musk announced plans to reform Twitter's moderation policies, which he believed were too restrictive. Musk also stated his intention to promote free speech on the platform, which he believed was essential for a healthy democracy.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the December suspensions, Musk had been actively involved in shaping Twitter's moderation policies. He had established a new content moderation council, which included representatives from various stakeholders, including civil society groups, academics, and industry experts. Musk had also announced plans to revise Twitter's rules, which he believed were too complex and open to interpretation.\n\n#Account suspensions\n\n##Twitter policy changes\n\nOn December 12, 2022, Twitter announced changes to its moderation policies, which included a new policy on \"live location sharing.\" The policy prohibited users from sharing live location information about individuals without their consent. The policy change was seen as a response to concerns about the sharing of location information about public figures, including Musk himself.\n\n##Suspension of flight-tracking accounts\n\nOn December 12, 2022, Twitter suspended several accounts that tracked the flight activity of private jets, including those owned by Musk. The accounts, which used publicly available data to track flight activity, were popular among aviation enthusiasts and journalists. The suspensions sparked widespread criticism, with many arguing that the accounts were not in violation of Twitter's rules.\n\n##Suspension of journalist accounts\n\nOn December 15, 2022, Twitter suspended several journalist accounts, including those of reporters from The New York Times, The Washington Post, and CNN. The suspensions were seen as a response to the journalists' coverage of Musk and Twitter's moderation policies. The suspensions sparked widespread outrage, with many arguing that the suspensions were an attack on press freedom.\n\n##Explanation from Twitter and Musk\n\nFollowing the suspensions, Twitter and Musk offered explanations for the actions. Twitter stated that the suspensions were in response to violations of the platform's rules, including the sharing of live location information. Musk stated that the suspensions were necessary to protect users from harassment and abuse. Musk also stated that the suspensions were not targeted at journalists, but rather at accounts that were sharing location information about individuals without their consent.\n\n#Reinstatement of some accounts\n\nOn December 16, 2022, Twitter reinstated several of the suspended accounts, including those of journalists and flight-tracking accounts. The reinstatements came after widespread criticism and pressure from civil society groups and media organizations. Musk stated that the reinstatements were a response to concerns about the impact of the suspensions on free speech and press freedom.\n\n#Responses\n\n##Suspended journalists\n\nThe suspended journalists were vocal in their criticism of the suspensions. Many argued that the suspensions were an attack on press freedom and an attempt to silence critical voices. The journalists also argued that the suspensions were not in line with Twitter's rules and that they had not been given adequate notice or explanation for the suspensions.\n\n##Other commentators\n\nOther commentators were also critical of the suspensions. Many argued that the suspensions were a sign of Musk's growing authoritarianism and his willingness to use Twitter's moderation policies to silence critics. Others argued that the suspensions were a response to the growing scrutiny of Musk and Twitter's moderation policies. Civil society groups and media organizations also condemned the suspensions, arguing that they were an attack on free speech and press freedom.\n\n#See also\n\n* Twitter moderation policies\n* Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter\n* Press freedom\n* Free speech\n* Social media regulation", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"December_2022_Twitter_suspensions\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Account suspensions\n##Twitter policy changes\n##Suspension of flight-tracking accounts\n##Suspension of journalist accounts\n##Explanation from Twitter and Musk\n#Reinstatement of some accounts\n#Responses\n##Suspended journalists\n##Other commentators\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The ship served as the flagship of the Russian Black Sea Fleet and was one of the most advanced warships in the Russian Navy. Throughout its service, the Moskva played a significant role in various naval operations and deployments, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\n#History\n\n##As Slava\n\nThe Slava-class cruiser was designed in the 1970s as a response to the United States Navy's Ticonderoga-class cruisers. The ship was laid down on November 6, 1976, at the 61 Kommunara Shipbuilding Plant in Mykolaiv, Ukraine, then part of the Soviet Union. Slava was launched on July 27, 1979, and commissioned on January 30, 1983. The ship was initially assigned to the Soviet Black Sea Fleet and served as its flagship.\n\nDuring its early years of service, Slava participated in various naval exercises and deployments, including a visit to the United States in 1989. The ship's armament included 16 P-500 Bazalt anti-ship missiles, 64 S-300F Fort air defense missiles, and 2 AK-130 twin-barreled 130mm guns. Slava also carried a Ka-27PL helicopter for anti-submarine warfare and search and rescue missions.\n\n##As Moskva\n\nFollowing the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Slava was transferred to the Russian Navy and renamed Moskva in 1995. The ship underwent a major modernization program, which included the installation of new radar and electronic warfare systems. Moskva continued to serve as the flagship of the Russian Black Sea Fleet and participated in various naval exercises and deployments.\n\nIn 2008, Moskva played a key role in the Russo-Georgian War, providing gunfire support to Russian troops during the Battle of Tskhinvali. The ship also participated in the Russian naval buildup in the Mediterranean Sea during the Syrian Civil War.\n\n##Russian invasion of Ukraine\n\n###Snake Island campaign\n\nDuring the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Moskva played a significant role in the capture of Snake Island, a strategic location in the Black Sea. On February 24, 2022, Russian forces launched a surprise attack on the island, which was defended by a Ukrainian garrison. Moskva provided gunfire support to the Russian landing force, which quickly overwhelmed the Ukrainian defenders.\n\nThe capture of Snake Island gave Russia control of the northwestern Black Sea and allowed its naval forces to blockade Ukrainian ports. Moskva remained in the area, providing gunfire support to Russian ground forces and enforcing the naval blockade.\n\n###Sinking\n\nOn April 13, 2022, Moskva was reportedly sunk by a Ukrainian Neptune anti-ship missile strike while en route to Sevastopol, the main base of the Russian Black Sea Fleet. The Russian Ministry of Defense confirmed that the ship had suffered significant damage and was on fire, but initially claimed that the cause was an accidental explosion of ammunition on board.\n\nHowever, Ukrainian officials and Western analysts quickly disputed the Russian account, citing evidence that the ship had been hit by a missile strike. The sinking of Moskva was widely seen as a major embarrassment for the Russian Navy and a significant blow to its capabilities in the Black Sea.\n\n#Notes\n\nThe sinking of Moskva marked one of the most significant losses for the Russian Navy since the end of the Cold War. The incident highlighted the vulnerability of Russian warships to anti-ship missiles and raised questions about the effectiveness of the Russian Navy's air defenses.\n\n#References\n\n#External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Russian_cruiser_Moskva\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##As Slava\n##As Moskva\n##Russian invasion of Ukraine\n###Snake Island campaign\n###Sinking\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
