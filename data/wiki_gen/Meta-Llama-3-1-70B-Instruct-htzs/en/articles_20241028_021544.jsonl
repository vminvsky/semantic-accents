He has served on the Court since 1991, and is the second African American to serve on the Court, after Thurgood Marshall. Thomas is known for his conservative judicial philosophy and his originalist approach to interpreting the Constitution.\n\nEarly life\n\nClarence Thomas was born on June 23, 1948, in Pin Point, Georgia, a small community near Savannah. He grew up in a poor family and was raised by his grandparents after his father abandoned the family when Thomas was two years old. Thomas's grandfather, Myers Anderson, was a successful businessman who owned a fuel oil delivery business and a farm. Thomas has credited his grandfather with instilling in him the values of hard work and self-reliance.\n\nCollege of the Holy Cross and Yale Law School\n\nThomas attended the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, where he graduated in 1971 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English literature. He then attended Yale Law School, where he earned his Juris Doctor degree in 1974. During his time at Yale, Thomas was a member of the Black Law Students Association and was active in the school's debate team.\n\nEarly legal career\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Thomas clerked for Judge John H. Pratt of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. He then worked as an assistant attorney general for the state of Missouri from 1977 to 1979. In 1979, Thomas joined the law firm of Monsanto Company, where he worked as a lawyer and later became a regulatory attorney.\n\nDistrict of Columbia Court of Appeals\n\nIn 1982, Thomas was appointed by President Ronald Reagan to serve on the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. He served on the court for four years, during which time he developed a reputation as a conservative jurist.\n\nNomination to the Supreme Court\n\nIn 1991, President George H.W. Bush nominated Thomas to replace Thurgood Marshall on the Supreme Court. Thomas's nomination was controversial, with many liberals opposing his nomination due to his conservative judicial philosophy.\n\nAnita Hill accusations\n\nDuring Thomas's confirmation hearings, Anita Hill, a law professor at the University of Oklahoma, accused Thomas of sexual harassment. Hill had worked for Thomas at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) in the 1980s, and she testified that Thomas had made unwanted advances towards her and had spoken about pornography in the workplace. Thomas denied the allegations, and a second hearing was held to investigate the charges.\n\nSecond hearing\n\nThe second hearing was held on October 11, 1991, and it was televised nationally. Thomas testified that he had never made any unwanted advances towards Hill, and he accused his opponents of engaging in a \"high-tech lynching\" to block his nomination. The hearing was widely watched, and it sparked a national debate about sexual harassment and the treatment of women in the workplace.\n\nSenate votes\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding his nomination, Thomas was confirmed by the Senate on October 15, 1991, by a vote of 52-48. He was sworn in as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court on October 23, 1991.\n\nSupreme Court of the United States\n\nThomas has served on the Supreme Court for over 25 years, and during that time he has developed a reputation as a conservative jurist. He has written numerous opinions on a wide range of topics, including government powers, individual rights, and constitutional law.\n\nGovernment powers and legal structure\n\nThomas has written extensively on the topic of government powers and the structure of the federal government. He has argued that the Constitution grants the federal government only limited powers, and that the states retain significant authority to govern themselves.\n\nCourt precedent\n\nThomas has been critical of the Court's use of precedent in its decision-making. He has argued that the Court should not rely on previous decisions to guide its decisions, but rather should interpret the Constitution as it was originally written.\n\nExecutive power\n\nThomas has written several opinions on the topic of executive power, and he has argued that the President has significant authority to act unilaterally in certain areas, such as national security and foreign policy.\n\nFederalism and states' rights\n\nThomas has been a strong advocate for federalism and states' rights. He has argued that the Constitution grants the states significant authority to govern themselves, and that the federal government should not interfere with state sovereignty.\n\nIndividual rights\n\nThomas has written numerous opinions on individual rights, including the First Amendment, Second Amendment, Fourth Amendment, Sixth Amendment, and Eighth Amendment.\n\nFirst Amendment\n\nThomas has written extensively on the topic of the First Amendment, and he has argued that the amendment protects speech, press, and assembly.\n\nSecond Amendment\n\nThomas has written several opinions on the topic of the Second Amendment, and he has argued that the amendment protects an individual's right to bear arms.\n\nFourth Amendment\n\nThomas has written several opinions on the topic of the Fourth Amendment, and he has argued that the amendment protects an individual's right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.\n\nSixth Amendment\n\nThomas has written several opinions on the topic of the Sixth Amendment, and he has argued that the amendment protects an individual's right to a fair trial.\n\nEighth Amendment\n\nThomas has written several opinions on the topic of the Eighth Amendment, and he has argued that the amendment prohibits cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nFourteenth Amendment\n\nThomas has written several opinions on the topic of the Fourteenth Amendment, and he has argued that the amendment protects an individual's right to equal protection under the law.\n\nAbortion and family planning\n\nThomas has written several opinions on the topic of abortion and family planning, and he has argued that the Constitution does not protect a woman's right to choose.\n\nLGBTQ rights\n\nThomas has written several opinions on the topic of LGBTQ rights, and he has argued that the Constitution does not protect an individual's right to same-sex marriage.\n\nOral arguments\n\nThomas has been known for his minimal participation in oral arguments before the Court. He has argued that the Court's traditional practice of questioning lawyers during oral argument is unnecessary and can be counterproductive.\n\nPersonal life\n\nThomas has been married twice, first to Kathy Ambush from 1971 until their divorce in 1984, and then to Virginia Lamp in 1987. He has one son, Jamal Adeen Thomas, from his first marriage.\n\nFamily\n\nThomas has spoken publicly about the importance of his family and his upbringing. He has credited his grandparents with instilling in him the values of hard work and self-reliance.\n\nReligion\n\nThomas is a devout Catholic and has spoken publicly about the importance of his faith in his life.\n\nLiterary influences\n\nThomas has spoken about the influence of several literary figures on his life, including Frederick Douglass and Booker T. Washington.\n\nMoira Smith allegations\n\nIn 2020, Moira Smith, a former law clerk for Thomas, accused him of making unwanted advances towards her in the 1990s. Thomas denied the allegations.\n\nNondisclosure of finances\n\nThomas has been criticized for his failure to disclose his wife's income from various sources, including the Heritage Foundation. Thomas has argued that the disclosure requirements are unnecessary and can be burdensome.\n\nHonors and recognition\n\nThomas has received numerous honors and awards for his service on the Court, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\nIn popular culture\n\nThomas has been portrayed in several films and television shows, including the 2016 film \"Confirmation\" and the 2020 film \"The Justice\".\n\nWritings\n\nThomas has written several books on law and politics, including \"My Grandfather's Son\" and \"The Court and the World\".\n\nSee also\n\n* List of justices of the Supreme Court of the United States\n* List of law clerks of the Supreme Court of the United States\n\nFootnotes\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\n* Foskett, Ken (2004).

The storm brought significant snowfall, freezing rain, and strong winds, leading to widespread disruptions and hazardous travel conditions.\n\n# Meteorological history\n\nThe storm system developed on December 20, 2022, in the Rocky Mountains, where a low-pressure system formed and began to move eastward. As the system moved into the central United States, it strengthened and began to produce significant snowfall, with some areas receiving over a foot of snow. The storm then moved into the eastern United States, where it brought a mix of snow, freezing rain, and sleet, causing significant disruptions.\n\nThe storm was fueled by a strong cold front that moved into the region, bringing with it cold air from Canada. The cold front interacted with the low-pressure system, causing the storm to intensify and produce heavy precipitation. The storm's strong winds also caused significant drifting and blowing snow, leading to hazardous travel conditions.\n\n# Preparations\n\nAs the storm approached, officials across the affected regions took steps to prepare for the expected disruptions. Many states and cities declared states of emergency, and National Guard troops were deployed to assist with storm response efforts. Emergency management officials also activated emergency operations centers to coordinate response efforts.\n\nAirlines and airports also took steps to prepare for the storm, canceling flights and preparing for potential delays. Many schools and businesses closed in advance of the storm, and some cities implemented travel bans to prevent unnecessary travel.\n\n# Impact\n\nThe storm had a significant impact on much of North America, with widespread disruptions and hazardous travel conditions.\n\n## Deaths\n\nAt least 91 people died as a result of the storm, with many more injured. The majority of the deaths were due to hypothermia, with some people succumbing to the cold after being stranded in their vehicles or homes.\n\n## Infrastructure\n\nThe storm had a significant impact on infrastructure, with many roads, bridges, and buildings affected.\n\n### Flight delays and cancellations\n\nThe storm caused significant disruptions to air travel, with over 10,000 flights canceled or delayed. Many airports were forced to close temporarily, and some airlines canceled all flights for several days.\n\n### Road closures and crashes\n\nThe storm caused significant disruptions to road travel, with many roads and highways closed due to heavy snow and ice. There were also numerous crashes, with some resulting in fatalities.\n\n### Intra-city transit disruptions\n\nThe storm caused significant disruptions to intra-city transit, with many buses and trains canceled or delayed. Some cities implemented emergency transit services to help people get around.\n\n### Inter-city train delays and cancellations\n\nThe storm caused significant disruptions to inter-city train travel, with many trains canceled or delayed. Some passengers were stranded for several days, waiting for trains to resume service.\n\n### Energy emergencies\n\nThe storm caused significant energy disruptions, with many areas experiencing power outages. Some cities declared energy emergencies, and utility crews worked to restore power as quickly as possible.\n\n### Power outages\n\nThe storm caused significant power outages, with over 1 million homes and businesses affected. Some areas experienced extended outages, with some people going without power for several days.\n\n## Sports\n\nThe storm had a significant impact on sports, with many events canceled or postponed. Some teams were forced to reschedule games, and some athletes were stranded due to travel disruptions.\n\n## Corporate and institutional closures\n\nThe storm caused significant disruptions to businesses and institutions, with many closing temporarily. Some companies implemented remote work arrangements, while others closed entirely.\n\n## Animals\n\nThe storm had a significant impact on animals, with many experiencing harsh conditions. Some animal shelters reported increased intakes, and some animal owners were forced to evacuate their homes due to the storm.\n\n# Post-storm cold wave\n\nThe storm was followed by a significant cold wave, with temperatures plummeting across much of North America.\n\n## Rocky Mountain region\n\nThe Rocky Mountain region experienced some of the coldest temperatures, with some areas reaching -40°F (-40°C). Many cities implemented emergency measures to help people stay warm, and some schools and businesses closed due to the cold.\n\n## Central United States\n\nThe central United States also experienced significant cold, with temperatures ranging from -20°F to -30°F (-29°C to -34°C). Some areas experienced wind chill values as low as -50°F (-45°C).\n\n## Eastern United States\n\nThe eastern United States experienced significant cold, with temperatures ranging from 0°F to 20°F (-18°C to -7°C). Some areas experienced wind chill values as low as -20°F (-29°C).\n\n# See also\n\n* List of snowstorms in the United States\n* List of blizzards in the United States\n* Winter storms in North America\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a general overview of the December 2022 North American winter storm.

Founded in 1983, the bank grew to become one of the largest banks in the United States, known for its expertise in serving the financial needs of innovative companies. Despite its success, the bank collapsed in 2023, marking one of the largest bank failures in U.S. history.\n\n#Foundation and early growth\n\nSilicon Valley Bank was founded in 1983 by Bill Biggerstaff and Roger Smith, two experienced bankers who recognized the growing need for specialized financial services in the technology industry. Initially, the bank operated as a small, community-based institution, focusing on providing loans and deposit accounts to local businesses. In the late 1980s, SVB began to expand its operations, establishing relationships with venture capital firms and offering services tailored to the needs of startups and emerging companies.\n\nDuring the 1990s, SVB experienced rapid growth, driven by the explosion of the technology industry in Silicon Valley. The bank's expertise in serving the financial needs of tech companies, combined with its willingness to take calculated risks, helped it to establish a strong reputation in the industry. By the end of the decade, SVB had grown to become one of the largest banks in the San Francisco Bay Area, with assets exceeding $10 billion.\n\n#Expansion\n\nIn the early 2000s, SVB began to expand its operations beyond California, establishing branches and offices in major technology hubs across the United States. The bank also expanded its product offerings, introducing new services such as asset management, wealth management, and investment banking. This expansion was driven by the growing demand for specialized financial services from the technology industry, as well as the bank's desire to diversify its revenue streams.\n\nSVB also expanded its international operations, establishing a presence in the United Kingdom, Israel, and other countries with significant technology industries. This expansion was driven by the bank's desire to serve the global needs of its clients, as well as to capitalize on the growth of technology industries outside of the United States.\n\n#Operations in lead-up to collapse\n\n##Business model\n\nSilicon Valley Bank's business model was centered around serving the financial needs of technology, life science, and healthcare companies. The bank offered a range of services, including loans, deposit accounts, cash management, and investment banking. SVB's expertise in serving the financial needs of innovative companies, combined with its willingness to take calculated risks, helped it to establish a strong reputation in the industry.\n\nSVB's business model was also characterized by its close relationships with venture capital firms and other investors. The bank worked closely with these firms to provide financing to startups and emerging companies, and to help them navigate the challenges of growth and expansion.\n\n##Facilities\n\nAt the time of its collapse, Silicon Valley Bank had over 30 branches and offices across the United States and internationally. The bank's headquarters was located in Santa Clara, California, and it had major operations centers in San Francisco, New York City, and Boston.\n\nSVB also had a significant presence in the United Kingdom, with offices in London and Cambridge. The bank's international operations were focused on serving the global needs of its clients, as well as to capitalize on the growth of technology industries outside of the United States.\n\n##Affiliations and community involvement\n\nSilicon Valley Bank was actively involved in the technology and life science communities, with partnerships and affiliations with numerous industry organizations and associations. The bank was a member of the National Venture Capital Association, the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, and the Technology CEO Council, among others.\n\nSVB also supported a range of community organizations and initiatives, with a focus on promoting education, innovation, and economic development in the communities it served. The bank's community involvement programs included support for local schools, universities, and non-profit organizations, as well as initiatives to promote diversity and inclusion in the technology industry.\n\n#Collapse\n\nOn March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank was closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) was appointed as its receiver. The collapse of SVB was triggered by a loss of confidence in the bank's financial condition, which led to a run on deposits and a liquidity crisis.\n\nThe collapse of SVB was attributed to a combination of factors, including the bank's exposure to the declining technology industry, its high concentration of deposits from a small number of large clients, and its failure to manage its interest rate risk effectively.\n\nThe collapse of SVB marked one of the largest bank failures in U.S. history, with assets of over $200 billion. The FDIC took control of the bank's operations and began the process of winding down its affairs, including the sale of its assets and the payment of depositors.\n\n#References\n\n#Works cited\n\n#Further reading\n\n#External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Silicon_Valley_Bank\" following this outline:\n\n#Foundation and early growth\n#Expansion\n#Operations in lead-up to collapse\n##Business model\n##Facilities\n##Affiliations and community involvement\n#Collapse\n#References\n##Works cited\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

From the early days of the Roman Republic to the late Empire, surgeons in ancient Rome developed a range of techniques, tools, and procedures that were often surprisingly sophisticated. This article provides an overview of the history, tools, and techniques of surgery in ancient Rome, highlighting the advancements and innovations that characterized this period.\n\n# History\n\nSurgery in ancient Rome has its roots in the early days of the Roman Republic, when medical practices were heavily influenced by Greek and Etruscan traditions. As the Roman Empire expanded, surgeons began to develop their own distinct approaches to surgical care, often drawing on the expertise of slaves, gladiators, and other groups. The Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder (23-79 CE) wrote extensively on medical topics, including surgery, and his works provide valuable insights into the practices of the time.\n\nThe golden age of Roman surgery is often associated with the 1st and 2nd centuries CE, when surgeons such as Galen (129-216 CE) and Aulus Cornelius Celsus (25 BCE-50 CE) made significant contributions to the field. Galen, in particular, is renowned for his work on human anatomy and his development of new surgical techniques, including the use of ligatures and surgical instruments. Celsus, meanwhile, wrote the influential medical text \"De Medicina,\" which includes detailed descriptions of surgical procedures and techniques.\n\n# Tools\n\nRoman surgeons employed a wide range of tools and instruments in their work, many of which were remarkably sophisticated. The following sections provide an overview of some of the most significant tools used in Roman surgery.\n\n## Cupping vessels\n\nCupping vessels were small, rounded containers used to create suction on the skin, often for therapeutic purposes. By heating the air inside the vessel and then applying it to the skin, Roman surgeons could create a partial vacuum that drew out blood and other fluids.\n\n## Chisels and raspatories\n\nChisels and raspatories were used for a range of tasks, including bone surgery and the removal of tumors. These instruments were often made from high-quality steel and were designed for precision and control.\n\n## Drills and levers\n\nDrills and levers were used for tasks such as trephining (a form of skull surgery) and the reduction of fractures. Roman surgeons developed a range of drill bits and levers that allowed them to perform these procedures with greater precision and accuracy.\n\n## Saws and trephines\n\nSaws and trephines were used for a range of surgical procedures, including amputations and skull surgery. Roman surgeons developed a range of saws and trephines that were designed for specific tasks and were often remarkably effective.\n\n## Forceps\n\nForceps were used for a range of tasks, including the removal of objects from the body and the manipulation of tissues.

These instruments were often made from high-quality materials and were designed for precision and control.\n\n## Scalpels\n\nScalpels were used for a range of tasks, including incisions and the removal of tumors. Roman surgeons developed a range of scalpels that were designed for precision and control.\n\n## Specula\n\nSpecula were used for tasks such as examining the interior of the body and removing objects from the body. Roman surgeons developed a range of specula that were designed for precision and control.\n\n## Spoon of Diocles\n\nThe Spoon of Diocles was a specialized instrument used for removing the placenta during childbirth. This instrument was designed for precision and control and was often remarkably effective.\n\n## Catheters\n\nCatheters were used for tasks such as draining fluids from the body and administering medications. Roman surgeons developed a range of catheters that were designed for precision and control.\n\n## Strigils\n\nStrigils were used for tasks such as cleaning the body and removing dirt and debris. These instruments were often made from high-quality materials and were designed for precision and control.\n\n## Knives and needles\n\nKnives and needles were used for a range of tasks, including incisions and suturing. Roman surgeons developed a range of knives and needles that were designed for precision and control.\n\n## Hooks\n\nHooks were used for tasks such as removing objects from the body and manipulating tissues. Roman surgeons developed a range of hooks that were designed for precision and control.\n\n## Other tools\n\nRoman surgeons also used a range of other tools and instruments, including retractors, dilators, and surgical clamps. These instruments were often designed for specific tasks and were often remarkably effective.\n\n# Techniques\n\nRoman surgeons employed a wide range of techniques and procedures in their work, many of which were remarkably sophisticated. The following sections provide an overview of some of the most significant techniques used in Roman surgery.\n\n## Abortion\n\nAbortion was a common practice in ancient Rome, and surgeons developed a range of techniques for terminating pregnancies. These techniques often involved the use of instruments, such as dilators and curettes, and were often remarkably effective.\n\n## Amputations and dissections\n\nAmputations and dissections were common procedures in Roman surgery, often performed for a range of reasons, including injury and disease.

This article explores the history and culture of African Greeks in these regions, highlighting their contributions to the development of Greek civilization in Africa.\n\n# Ancient Egypt\n---------------\n\nAncient Egypt was one of the earliest and most significant centers of Greek culture in Africa. The presence of Greeks in Egypt dates back to the 7th century BC, when Greek mercenaries and traders began to arrive in the country.\n\n## First historical colonies\n---------------------------\n\nThe first Greek colony in Egypt was established in the 7th century BC, during the reign of Pharaoh Psamtek I. This colony, known as Naucratis, was founded by Milesian Greeks and was situated in the Nile Delta. Naucratis quickly became an important center of Greek trade and culture in Egypt, and it remained a significant Greek colony for many centuries.\n\n## Hellenistic times\n-------------------\n\n### Rule of Alexander the Great (332–323 BC)\n------------------------------------------\n\nIn 332 BC, Alexander the Great conquered Egypt, which became a major center of Greek culture in the Hellenistic world. Alexander founded the city of Alexandria, which would become one of the most important cities in the ancient Greek world. Alexandria was a major center of Greek learning and culture, and it attracted scholars and intellectuals from all over the Mediterranean.\n\n### The Ptolemaic Empire (323–30 BC)\n----------------------------------\n\nAfter Alexander's death, Egypt was ruled by the Ptolemaic dynasty, which was a Greek dynasty that ruled Egypt for over 300 years. During this period, Greek culture flourished in Egypt, and many Greeks settled in the country. The Ptolemies encouraged the development of Greek culture in Egypt, and they built many temples, theaters, and other public buildings in the Greek style.\n\n## Roman and Byzantine Egypt\n---------------------------\n\n### Coptic Greeks\n-----------------\n\nDuring the Roman and Byzantine periods, many Greeks continued to live in Egypt, particularly in the cities of Alexandria and Cairo. These Greeks were known as Coptic Greeks, and they played an important role in the development of Coptic Christianity. The Coptic Greeks were a distinct ethnic group that was formed by the intermarriage of Greeks and Egyptians, and they developed a unique culture that combined elements of Greek and Egyptian traditions.\n\n# Ancient Ethiopia\n-------------------\n\nAncient Ethiopia was another region in Africa where Greeks settled and established communities. The presence of Greeks in Ethiopia dates back to the 1st century AD, when Greek traders and missionaries began to arrive in the country.\n\n## Axumites of Ethiopia\n----------------------\n\nThe Axumites were a ancient Ethiopian kingdom that was established in the 1st century AD. The Axumites were a major power in East Africa, and they had extensive trade and cultural contacts with the ancient Greeks. Many Axumites were converted to Christianity by Greek missionaries, and they developed a unique form of Christianity that combined elements of Greek and Ethiopian traditions.\n\n## Abyssinian Greeks\n--------------------\n\nThe Abyssinian Greeks were a community of Greeks who lived in Ethiopia during the medieval period. The Abyssinian Greeks were primarily merchants and traders, and they played an important role in the development of trade and commerce in Ethiopia. Many Abyssinian Greeks were also scholars and intellectuals, and they made significant contributions to the development of Ethiopian literature and culture.\n\n# Ancient Libya\n----------------\n\nAncient Libya was another region in Africa where Greeks settled and established communities. The presence of Greeks in Libya dates back to the 7th century BC, when Greek colonizers established the city of Cyrene.\n\n## Libyan Greeks of Cyrenaica\n-----------------------------\n\nThe Libyan Greeks of Cyrenaica were a community of Greeks who lived in the region of Cyrenaica, in eastern Libya. The Libyan Greeks of Cyrenaica were primarily farmers and herders, and they developed a unique culture that combined elements of Greek and Libyan traditions.\n\n## Libyan Greek culture\n-----------------------\n\nLibyan Greek culture was a unique blend of Greek and Libyan traditions. The Libyan Greeks developed a distinct form of art and architecture that combined elements of Greek and Libyan styles. They also developed a unique form of literature and poetry that reflected their mixed cultural heritage.\n\n# Ancient Nubia\n----------------\n\nAncient Nubia was a region in northeastern Africa that was inhabited by a number of different ethnic groups, including the Nubians and the Greeks. The presence of Greeks in Nubia dates back to the 1st century AD, when Greek traders and missionaries began to arrive in the region.\n\n## Axumite subjugation of Nubia\n------------------------------\n\nIn the 3rd century AD, the Axumites conquered Nubia and established a number of Greek colonies in the region. The Axumites brought many Greek settlers to Nubia, and they established a number of Greek cities and towns in the region.\n\n## Nubian Greeks\n----------------\n\nThe Nubian Greeks were a community of Greeks who lived in Nubia during the medieval period.

The remains are estimated to be around 7,000 years old, dating back to the Mesolithic period. The discovery of the Luttra Woman has provided significant insights into the lives of ancient humans, their health, diet, and living conditions.\n\n# Discovery\n\nThe Luttra Woman was discovered on August 14, 1943, by a farmer named Gösta Aronsson while digging a ditch on his property in Luttra, a small village in the province of Västergötland, Sweden. The skeleton was found in a peat bog, which is a type of wetland that accumulates acidic, oxygen-poor soil. The peat bog environment helped to preserve the skeleton, as well as other organic materials found at the site, such as clothing and tools.\n\nThe discovery was reported to the local authorities, and a team of archaeologists and anthropologists was sent to excavate the site. The excavation was led by Dr. Nils-Gustaf Gejvall, a renowned Swedish archaeologist. The team carefully extracted the skeleton and other artifacts from the peat bog, taking care to document and preserve every detail.\n\n# Studies\n\nThe Luttra Woman skeleton was subjected to extensive study and analysis by various experts in the fields of anthropology, archaeology, and medicine. The studies aimed to reconstruct the life and death of the individual, as well as to gain insights into the culture and way of life of ancient humans.\n\n## Cause of death\n\nThe analysis of the skeleton revealed that the Luttra Woman died in her mid-40s, which was relatively old for the Mesolithic period. The cause of death was determined to be a severe blow to the head, which resulted in a fractured skull. The blow was likely inflicted with a blunt instrument, such as a stone or a wooden club.\n\nThe study also revealed that the Luttra Woman suffered from various health problems, including arthritis, tooth decay, and parasites. These health issues were likely caused by a combination of factors, including poor diet, hard physical labor, and exposure to diseases.\n\n# Exhibition and reconstruction\n\nThe Luttra Woman skeleton is currently on display at the Museum of National Antiquities in Stockholm, Sweden. The museum has created a reconstructed exhibit of the skeleton, which includes a life-size model of the individual, dressed in clothing and accessories typical of the Mesolithic period.\n\nThe reconstruction was based on the analysis of the skeleton and other artifacts found at the site, as well as on comparative studies of other Mesolithic human remains. The exhibit provides a unique glimpse into the life and culture of ancient humans, and it has become one of the most popular attractions at the museum.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of notable human remains\n* Mesolithic Europe\n* Peat bog\n* Archaeology in Sweden\n\n# References\n\n## Notes\n\n## Citations\n\n# External links\n\n* Museum of National Antiquities, Stockholm, Sweden\n* The Luttra Woman exhibit at the Museum of National Antiquities\n* Article about the Luttra Woman in the Journal of Archaeological Science", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Luttra_Woman\" following this outline:\n\n#Discovery\n#Studies\n##Cause of death\n#Exhibition and reconstruction\n#See also\n#References\n##Notes\n##Citations\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This team will consist of athletes who are unable to participate under their national flags due to various reasons, including international sanctions, conflicts, or other exceptional circumstances.\n\n# Background\n\nThe concept of Individual Neutral Athletes is not new to the Olympic Games. In the past, athletes from countries that were under international sanctions or had their national Olympic committees suspended have competed as Independent Olympic Participants or under other neutral designations. However, the 2024 Summer Olympics will see a significant number of athletes competing as Individual Neutral Athletes due to various ongoing conflicts and international tensions.\n\n## Timeline\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced the creation of the Individual Neutral Athlete team in 2023, following a series of meetings with international sports federations and national Olympic committees. The IOC established a set of criteria for athletes to be eligible to compete as Individual Neutral Athletes, including being from countries that are under international sanctions or have their national Olympic committees suspended.\n\n## Controversies\n\nThe decision to allow Individual Neutral Athletes to compete at the 2024 Summer Olympics has been met with controversy from some quarters. Some have argued that it undermines the Olympic spirit of national representation and could create an uneven playing field. Others have expressed concerns about the potential for athletes to be used as pawns in international politics.\n\n## Media coverage\n\nThe Individual Neutral Athlete team has received significant media attention, with many outlets highlighting the stories of athletes who will be competing under the Olympic flag. The media coverage has focused on the challenges faced by these athletes, including their journeys to the Olympics and their experiences competing without national representation.\n\n# Medals summary\n\nThe Individual Neutral Athlete team is expected to compete in a range of sports and events at the 2024 Summer Olympics.

Federal judges are appointed for life, and their deaths can create vacancies that need to be filled through a process that involves the executive and legislative branches of government. This article provides an overview of the deaths of United States federal judges in active service, including the background, political and logistical consequences, and lists of judges who have died in active service.\n\n#Background\n\nFederal judges in the United States are appointed for life, which means that they serve until they resign, retire, or die. The Constitution grants federal judges life tenure to ensure their independence and impartiality. The life tenure of federal judges is designed to insulate them from political pressure and allow them to make decisions based on the law, rather than political considerations.\n\nHowever, the death of a federal judge can create a vacancy that needs to be filled. The process of filling a vacancy on the federal bench involves the executive and legislative branches of government. The President nominates a replacement, who must be confirmed by the Senate. This process can be contentious, especially if the vacancy occurs on the Supreme Court or in a district with a high-profile case pending.\n\n#Political consequences\n\nThe death of a federal judge can have significant political consequences. The vacancy created by a judge's death can be seen as an opportunity by the President and the Senate to shape the federal judiciary. The President may nominate a replacement who shares their ideological views, while the Senate may try to block the nomination if they disagree with the President's choice.\n\nThe death of a Supreme Court justice can be particularly significant, as it can alter the balance of the Court and affect the outcome of future cases. The confirmation process for a Supreme Court justice can be highly contentious, with the Senate holding hearings and debates to consider the nominee's qualifications and views.\n\n#Logistical consequences\n\nThe death of a federal judge can also have logistical consequences for the administration of justice. When a judge dies, their cases must be reassigned to another judge, which can cause delays and disruptions. The court may need to appoint a temporary judge to handle the deceased judge's cases, or the cases may need to be transferred to another court.\n\nThe death of a judge can also affect the court's docket and scheduling. The court may need to reschedule hearings and trials, which can cause inconvenience to parties and attorneys involved in the cases. The court may also need to adjust its budget and resources to accommodate the loss of a judge.\n\n#Lists\n\nThe following lists provide information on the deaths of United States federal judges in active service.\n\n##1789–1869\n\nThe first federal judges were appointed in 1789, and several judges died in active service during the early years of the federal judiciary.\n\n* William Cushing (Supreme Court justice), died September 13, 1810\n* James Wilson (Supreme Court justice), died August 21, 1798\n* John Blair (Supreme Court justice), died August 31, 1800\n* William Paterson (Supreme Court justice), died September 9, 1806\n* Samuel Chase (Supreme Court justice), died June 19, 1811\n\n##1870–1919\n\nDuring the late 19th and early 20th centuries, several federal judges died in active service.\n\n* Noah Haynes Swayne (Supreme Court justice), died June 8, 1884\n* Joseph P.

With a career spanning over two decades, Abu Akleh was a prominent figure in Middle Eastern journalism, known for her fearless reporting and extensive coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\n#Early life and education\n\nShireen Abu Akleh was born on April 3, 1971, in Jerusalem, to a Palestinian Christian family. She spent her early years in the United States, where her family had moved, and later returned to Jerusalem with her family. Abu Akleh graduated from the Institute of Modern Media at Al-Quds University in Ramallah, where she earned a degree in journalism.\n\n#Career\n\nAbu Akleh began her career in journalism in the late 1990s, working for various local and international media outlets, including Voice of Palestine radio and Amman Satellite Channel. In 2000, she joined Al Jazeera, where she quickly rose through the ranks to become one of the network's most prominent correspondents.\n\nThroughout her career, Abu Akleh reported on numerous significant events in the Middle East, including the Second Intifada, the Gaza wars, and the Israeli occupation of the West Bank. Her fearless and balanced reporting earned her widespread recognition and respect, both within the Arab world and internationally.\n\n#Death\n\nOn May 11, 2022, Abu Akleh was shot and killed while reporting on an Israeli military operation in the Jenin refugee camp in the West Bank. The incident occurred during a raid by Israeli forces on a Palestinian militant group, and Abu Akleh was hit by a bullet to the head while wearing a press vest and helmet. She was rushed to a nearby hospital, where she was pronounced dead.\n\n##Aftermath\n\nThe killing of Abu Akleh sparked widespread outrage and condemnation across the Middle East and internationally. The Palestinian Authority, the United States, and numerous other countries called for an investigation into the incident. Al Jazeera described Abu Akleh's death as a \"heinous crime\" and accused Israeli forces of deliberately targeting her.\n\n#Funeral\n\nAbu Akleh's funeral was held on May 13, 2022, in Jerusalem, and was attended by thousands of mourners, including Palestinian officials, journalists, and ordinary citizens. The funeral procession was marked by clashes between Palestinian mourners and Israeli police, who attempted to intervene in the ceremony.\n\n#Reaction\n\nThe killing of Abu Akleh sparked widespread reaction and condemnation from governments, international organizations, and media outlets around the world. The United States, the European Union, and the United Nations all called for an investigation into the incident, and numerous countries expressed their condolences to Abu Akleh's family.\n\n#Investigations\n\n##Initial Israel investigations\n\nThe Israeli military initially claimed that Abu Akleh was killed in crossfire between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants. However, an investigation by the Israeli military later concluded that Abu Akleh was likely killed by Israeli gunfire, but that the shooting was unintentional.\n\n##Subsequent investigations\n\nIn the aftermath of Abu Akleh's death, numerous investigations were launched by various organizations, including the Palestinian Authority, Al Jazeera, and the United Nations. These investigations have raised questions about the Israeli military's version of events and have called for further investigation into the incident.\n\n##Announcement of US investigation\n\nIn May 2022, the United States announced that it would conduct its own investigation into Abu Akleh's death. The investigation, led by the US State Department, aims to determine the circumstances surrounding Abu Akleh's killing and to identify those responsible.\n\n##Referral of case to the International Criminal Court\n\nIn June 2022, the Palestinian Authority referred the case of Abu Akleh's killing to the International Criminal Court (ICC), calling for an investigation into the incident as a possible war crime. The ICC has announced that it will conduct a preliminary examination into the case.\n\n#Remembrance and legacy\n\nShireen Abu Akleh's legacy as a journalist and a symbol of Palestinian resistance continues to inspire people around the world. Her fearless reporting and commitment to telling the stories of those affected by conflict have made her a beloved figure in the Middle East and beyond.\n\n#Honors and awards\n\nAbu Akleh received numerous awards and honors for her journalism, including the Palestinian Ministry of Information's Award for Excellence in Journalism and the Arab Journalism Award.\n\n#See also\n\n* Al Jazeera\n* Israeli-Palestinian conflict\n* International Criminal Court\n* Freedom of the press\n\n#Notes\n\n* This article is a general overview of Shireen Abu Akleh's life and career, and is not intended to be a comprehensive or definitive account of her work.\n\n#References\n\n* (None)\n\n#External links\n\n* Al Jazeera: Shireen Abu Akleh\n* BBC News: Shireen Abu Akleh\n* The New York Times: Shireen Abu Akleh", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Shireen_Abu_Akleh\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and education\n#Career\n#Death\n##Aftermath\n#Funeral\n#Reaction\n#Investigations\n##Initial Israel investigations\n##Subsequent investigations\n##Announcement of US investigation\n##Referral of case to the International Criminal Court\n#Remembrance and legacy\n#Honors and awards\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The season produced a total of 22 named storms, 13 hurricanes, and 8 major hurricanes, making it one of the most active seasons on record.\n\n# Seasonal Forecasts\n\nPre-season forecasts predicted an above-average season, with 15-20 named storms, 7-10 hurricanes, and 3-5 major hurricanes. These forecasts were based on the warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures in the Eastern Pacific and the predicted El Niño event. However, the actual season exceeded these predictions, with the number of named storms and hurricanes significantly higher than forecast.\n\n# Seasonal Summary\n\n## Background\n\nThe 2023 Pacific hurricane season began on May 15, 2023, marking the official start of the tropical cyclone season in the Eastern Pacific Ocean.

The project allows users to create and edit a large-scale digital canvas, with each user contributing a single pixel to the artwork. Over time, the project has evolved to become a social experiment, testing the boundaries of community-driven creativity and the dynamics of online collaboration.\n\n**Overview**\n\nR/place is a subreddit community that hosts a large digital canvas, divided into a grid of millions of pixels. Each Reddit user can contribute to the artwork by placing a single pixel on the canvas, choosing from a palette of 16 colors. The project relies on the collective efforts of thousands of users, resulting in a constantly evolving and dynamic artwork. The project's purpose is to create a collaborative and interactive art piece, showcasing the capabilities of online communities and the power of collective creativity.\n\n**History**\n\nThe R/place project has undergone several iterations since its inception, each with its unique characteristics and outcomes.\n\n## **2017 experiment**\n\nThe first R/place experiment was launched on April 1, 2017, as an April Fools' Day joke. The project was created by Reddit's administrators, who wanted to test the site's capabilities and engage the community in a creative endeavor. The initial canvas consisted of a million pixels, and users were allowed to place one pixel every five minutes. The project quickly gained traction, with thousands of users contributing to the artwork.\n\nThe 2017 experiment resulted in a diverse and vibrant artwork, featuring a range of images, logos, and symbols. The project demonstrated the power of collective creativity and the ability of online communities to come together and achieve a common goal. However, the project also highlighted the challenges of managing a large-scale collaborative artwork, with some users engaging in vandalism and attempts to disrupt the project.\n\n## **2022 experiment**\n\nThe second R/place experiment was launched on April 1, 2022, exactly five years after the initial project. The new canvas consisted of 2 million pixels, and users were allowed to place one pixel every 10 minutes. The 2022 experiment introduced several new features, including the ability to create custom palettes and the option to view the artwork in different modes.\n\nThe 2022 experiment resulted in an even more diverse and complex artwork, featuring intricate designs, logos, and images. The project also saw the emergence of various sub-communities, each with their own creative agendas and goals. However, the project also faced challenges, including increased vandalism and attempts to manipulate the artwork.\n\n## **2023 experiment**\n\nThe third R/place experiment was launched on March 17, 2023, and is ongoing. The current canvas consists of 4 million pixels, and users are allowed to place one pixel every 15 minutes. The 2023 experiment has introduced several new features, including the ability to create custom shapes and the option to view the artwork in 3D.\n\nThe 2023 experiment has resulted in a highly dynamic and evolving artwork, featuring a range of images, logos, and symbols. The project has also seen the emergence of various sub-communities, each with their own creative agendas and goals. However, the project also faces challenges, including increased vandalism and attempts to disrupt the artwork.\n\n**Media response**\n\nR/place has received significant media attention since its inception, with various outlets covering the project's progress and outcomes. The project has been featured in major publications, including The New York Times, The Guardian, and CNN.\n\nThe media response to R/place has been largely positive, with many outlets praising the project's creativity and community-driven approach. However, some outlets have also raised concerns about the project's potential for vandalism and disruption.\n\n**Atlas**\n\nThe R/place Atlas is a comprehensive guide to the project's history and outcomes. The Atlas features a detailed timeline of the project's evolution, as well as a collection of images and artworks created during each experiment.\n\nThe Atlas also includes a range of statistics and data, providing insights into the project's demographics, user engagement, and creative outcomes. The Atlas is a valuable resource for researchers, artists, and anyone interested in the R/place project.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Collaborative art\n* Digital art\n* Online communities\n* Reddit\n* Social experiment\n\n**References**\n\n*None*\n\n**External links**\n\n* R/place subreddit\n* R/place Atlas\n* Reddit's official blog post about R/place", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"R/place\" following this outline:\n\n#Overview\n#History\n##2017 experiment\n##2022 experiment\n##2023 experiment\n#Media response\n#Atlas\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is based on the DC Comics character of the same name and stars Robert Pattinson as the titular character. The film follows Batman as he investigates a series of murders committed by the Riddler, who is targeting Gotham City's elite.\n\n#Plot\n\nThe film takes place two years after Bruce Wayne's transformation into Batman. The story begins with Batman investigating a series of gruesome murders committed by the Riddler, who is targeting Gotham City's wealthy and powerful citizens. As Batman delves deeper into the case, he discovers that the Riddler's true intention is to expose the city's deep-seated corruption and hypocrisy.\n\nMeanwhile, Batman's investigation leads him to Oswald Cobblepot, also known as the Penguin, a crime lord who is secretly working with the Riddler. Batman also encounters Selina Kyle, a cat burglar who is connected to the Penguin's operation.\n\nAs the investigation unfolds, Batman uncovers a web of corruption that goes all the way to the top of Gotham City's government and law enforcement. He must navigate this complex network to stop the Riddler and the Penguin before they can carry out their plan to destroy the city.\n\n#Cast\n\n* Robert Pattinson as Bruce Wayne / Batman\n* Zoë Kravitz as Selina Kyle / Catwoman\n* Paul Dano as Edward Nashton / Riddler\n* Jeffrey Wright as James Gordon\n* John Turturro as Carmine Falcone\n* Andy Serkis as Alfred Pennyworth\n* Colin Farrell as Oswald Cobblepot / Penguin\n\n#Production\n\n##Development\n\n###Early work and initial plans from Ben Affleck\n\nThe film was first announced in 2014, with Ben Affleck set to star, write, and direct. However, Affleck dropped out of the project in 2017, citing a desire to focus on acting. Matt Reeves was subsequently brought on board to direct and co-write the film.\n\n###Redevelopment under Matt Reeves\n\nReeves worked closely with co-writer Peter Craig to develop a new script for the film. The script took a darker and more introspective approach to the character, exploring themes of trauma, grief, and redemption.\n\n##Writing\n\nThe film's script was written by Matt Reeves and Peter Craig. The story is heavily influenced by the comic book series \"The Long Halloween\" by Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale. The script also draws inspiration from the works of Alfred Hitchcock and David Fincher.\n\n##Casting\n\nRobert Pattinson was cast as Bruce Wayne/Batman in May 2019.

The locomotive is a Class J 4-8-4 locomotive, with a 4-8-4 wheel arrangement, and is one of the last of its kind to be built in the United States. The 611 is considered one of the most iconic and beloved steam locomotives in the world, known for its sleek design, powerful performance, and rich history.\n\nDesign and Abilities\n--------------------\n\nThe Norfolk and Western 611 was designed to be a high-speed passenger locomotive, capable of hauling heavy trains at speeds of up to 100 mph. The locomotive features a 4-8-4 wheel arrangement, with a four-wheel leading truck, eight driving wheels, and a four-wheel trailing truck. The 611 is powered by a three-cylinder steam engine, with a 27x32-inch cylinder size and a 310-psi boiler pressure. The locomotive has a top speed of 100 mph and can produce 5,500 horsepower.\n\nThe 611 features a number of innovative design elements, including a streamlined nose and a unique \"torpedo\" shape, which helps to reduce wind resistance and improve aerodynamics. The locomotive also features a large, cast-steel frame, which provides exceptional strength and stability.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### Revenue Service\n\nThe Norfolk and Western 611 entered revenue service on May 29, 1950, and was initially assigned to haul passenger trains between Norfolk, Virginia, and Cincinnati, Ohio. The locomotive quickly gained a reputation for its speed, reliability, and comfort, and became a favorite among passengers and crew members alike.\n\nDuring its revenue service career, the 611 hauled some of the most famous passenger trains in the United States, including the Powhatan Arrow and the Pocahontas. The locomotive also participated in a number of special events and excursions, including the 1952 Republican National Convention in Chicago and the 1955 National Railway Historical Society Convention in Roanoke.\n\n### First Retirement\n\nThe Norfolk and Western 611 was retired from revenue service on October 9, 1959, as part of the N&W's transition to diesel-electric locomotives. The locomotive was stored in the N&W's Roanoke Shops, where it remained for several years.\n\n### First Mainline Excursion Service\n\nIn 1964, the 611 was restored to operating condition and began a new career as a mainline excursion locomotive. The locomotive was used to haul a number of excursion trains, including the popular \"611 Excursion\" series, which ran between Roanoke and Norfolk.\n\nDuring this period, the 611 became a beloved fixture on the American railfan scene, attracting thousands of fans and enthusiasts to its excursions. The locomotive also appeared in a number of films and television shows, including the 1966 film \"The Wild Wild West.\"\n\n### Second Retirement\n\nThe Norfolk and Western 611 was retired from excursion service in 1994, due to a combination of factors, including rising maintenance costs and declining revenue. The locomotive was stored in the N&W's Roanoke Shops, where it remained for several years.\n\n### Second Mainline Excursion Service\n\nIn 2015, the 611 was restored to operating condition once again, and began a new career as a mainline excursion locomotive. The locomotive is currently operated by the Virginia Museum of Transportation, which offers a number of excursion trains and events throughout the year.\n\n### Post-NS Excursion Service\n\nIn 2020, the 611 began operating excursion trains on the former Norfolk Southern (NS) network, following the merger of NS with the Genesee and Wyoming Railway. The locomotive has since become a regular fixture on the NS network, hauling excursion trains and participating in special events.\n\nAccidents and Incidents\n----------------------\n\nThe Norfolk and Western 611 has been involved in a number of accidents and incidents throughout its career, including a 1952 derailment in West Virginia and a 1967 collision with a diesel locomotive in Virginia. However, the locomotive has never been seriously damaged and has always been restored to operating condition.\n\nIn Popular Culture\n------------------\n\nThe Norfolk and Western 611 has appeared in a number of films, television shows, and books, including the 1966 film \"The Wild Wild West\" and the 1976 book \"The Steam Locomotive\" by Lucius Beebe. The locomotive has also been featured on a number of postage stamps and coins, including a 2015 commemorative stamp issued by the United States Postal Service.\n\nSee Also\n--------\n\n* Norfolk and Western Railway\n* Class J locomotive\n* Streamlined steam locomotive\n* Excursion train\n* Heritage railway\n\nNotes\n-----\n\n* The Norfolk and Western 611 is one of the last steam locomotives to be built in the United States.\n* The locomotive has a unique \"torpedo\" shape, which helps to reduce wind resistance and improve aerodynamics.\n* The 611 has been involved in a number of accidents and incidents throughout its career, but has never been seriously damaged.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n* (None)\n\nBibliography\n------------\n\n* Beebe, Lucius. \"The Steam Locomotive.\" Dutton, 1976.\n* Johnson, William. \"The Norfolk and Western Railway.\" Kalmbach Publishing, 2001.\n* Withuhn, William. \"The American Steam Locomotive.\" Indiana University Press, 2004.\n\nExternal Links\n---------------\n\n* Virginia Museum of Transportation\n* Norfolk and Western Railway\n* Class J locomotive\n* Streamlined steam locomotive\n* Excursion train\n* Heritage railway", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Norfolk_and_Western_611\" following this outline:\n\n#Design and abilities\n#History\n##Revenue service\n##First retirement\n##First mainline excursion service\n##Second retirement\n##Second mainline excursion service\n##Post-NS excursion service\n#Accidents and incidents\n#In popular culture\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The storm was the seventh named storm and the fourth typhoon of the 2023 Pacific typhoon season. Doksuri brought widespread flooding, strong winds, and heavy rainfall to the Philippines, Taiwan, China, and Vietnam, causing significant damage and disruption to the affected areas.\n\n#Meteorological history\n\nTyphoon Doksuri originated from a tropical disturbance that formed on July 10, 2023, in the western Pacific Ocean, about 1,000 km (620 miles) east of the Philippines. The disturbance gradually intensified into a tropical depression on July 12, and further strengthened into a tropical storm on July 13. The storm was named Doksuri by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and Egay by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA).\n\nDoksuri continued to intensify as it moved northwestward, becoming a severe tropical storm on July 14 and a typhoon on July 15. The storm reached its peak intensity on July 16, with maximum sustained winds of 220 km/h (137 mph) and a minimum central pressure of 935 hPa (27.61 inHg). Doksuri began to weaken on July 17 as it approached the coast of China, making landfall in Fujian Province on July 18.\n\n#Preparations\n\n##Philippines\n\nThe Philippine government issued warnings and advisories as Doksuri approached the country. PAGASA raised Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 2 over several provinces, indicating that winds of up to 100 km/h (62 mph) were expected.

A wooden sailboat, the Adriana, carrying hundreds of migrants, capsized and sank in the Ionian Sea, claiming the lives of numerous people.\n\n# Background\n\nThe Adriana was part of a larger trend of migrant boats attempting to reach European shores via the Mediterranean Sea. The European migrant crisis, which began in 2015, has seen millions of people flee their home countries in search of safety, economic opportunities, and a better life. Greece, in particular, has been a major entry point for migrants, with many attempting to reach the country's islands and mainland.\n\nIn the months leading up to the disaster, there had been an increase in migrant boat arrivals in Greece, with many vessels intercepted and rescued by Greek authorities. However, the Adriana's ill-fated journey highlighted the risks and dangers faced by migrants attempting to reach Europe by sea.\n\n# The Migrant Boat, the Adriana\n\nThe Adriana was a wooden sailboat, approximately 15 meters in length, built for fishing or recreational purposes. It was not designed for carrying large numbers of people, and its seaworthiness was questionable. The vessel was overcrowded, with estimates suggesting that it was carrying between 400 to 500 migrants, far exceeding its capacity.\n\nThe migrants on board were from various countries, including Syria, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Somalia, among others. Many were fleeing conflict, persecution, or poverty in their home countries. The Adriana's crew, reportedly consisting of smugglers, had promised the migrants a safe passage to Italy or other European destinations.\n\n# Distress Calls and Response\n\nOn June 14, 2023, the Adriana sent out distress calls to Greek authorities, reporting engine failure and difficulties navigating the rough seas. The vessel was located approximately 70 nautical miles off the coast of Messenia, in the Ionian Sea.\n\nGreek coast guard vessels and a rescue ship were dispatched to the scene, but their response was delayed due to adverse weather conditions. The migrants on board the Adriana were left stranded for several hours, exposed to the elements and without assistance.\n\n# Capsizing\n\nAt around 10:00 AM local time, the Adriana capsized and sank, throwing hundreds of migrants into the water. The exact circumstances surrounding the capsize are unclear, but it is believed that the vessel was overwhelmed by the sheer number of people on board, combined with the rough seas.\n\nMany of the migrants were unable to swim or were trapped below deck, leading to a significant loss of life. Those who managed to escape the sinking vessel were left clinging to debris or swimming in the water, awaiting rescue.\n\n# Victims\n\nThe exact number of fatalities from the 2023 Messenia migrant boat disaster is still unknown, but it is estimated that between 200 to 300 people lost their lives. Many more were injured, and several dozen were reported missing in the aftermath of the tragedy.\n\nThe victims were from various countries and backgrounds, with many families and children among the dead. The disaster was widely condemned by governments, humanitarian organizations, and human rights groups, who called for increased action to prevent such tragedies in the future.\n\n# Search, Rescue, and Detention\n\nGreek authorities launched a massive search and rescue operation, involving multiple vessels, helicopters, and personnel. Survivors were taken to nearby islands and the mainland, where they received medical attention and accommodation.\n\nHowever, many of the rescued migrants were detained by Greek authorities, pending identification and processing. Human rights groups raised concerns about the conditions in which the migrants were being held, citing overcrowding, inadequate facilities, and limited access to medical care.\n\n## Protests\n\nIn the days following the disaster, protests were held in Greece and other European countries, condemning the treatment of migrants and calling for greater action to prevent such tragedies. Activists and human rights groups demanded improved search and rescue operations, increased funding for migrant support services, and more humane treatment of asylum seekers.\n\n# Response\n\nThe 2023 Messenia migrant boat disaster sparked a significant response from governments, humanitarian organizations, and civil society. Greek authorities faced criticism for their handling of the disaster, with many calling for greater action to prevent such tragedies in the future.\n\nThe European Union and other international organizations pledged support for Greece and other countries affected by the migrant crisis. Humanitarian groups, such as the Red Cross and Médecins Sans Frontières, provided assistance to survivors and called for increased funding to support migrant services.\n\n# Judicial Proceedings\n\nIn the aftermath of the disaster, Greek authorities launched an investigation into the sinking of the Adriana and the circumstances surrounding the tragedy. Several individuals, including the vessel's crew and owners, were arrested and charged with human trafficking and other offenses.\n\nThe investigation is ongoing, with many questions still unanswered about the events leading up to the disaster. It is likely that the case will take several years to come to trial, with many of the accused facing serious charges and potential prison sentences.\n\n# Investigations\n\nIn addition to the judicial investigation, several other inquiries were launched into the 2023 Messenia migrant boat disaster. The Greek parliament established a committee to examine the circumstances surrounding the tragedy, while the European Union's border agency, Frontex, conducted its own investigation into the incident.\n\nHumanitarian organizations and human rights groups also conducted their own investigations, highlighting concerns about the treatment of migrants and the need for improved search and rescue operations.\n\n# Reactions\n\nThe 2023 Messenia migrant boat disaster sparked widespread condemnation and outrage, with many governments, organizations, and individuals expressing shock and sadness at the loss of life.\n\nThe disaster highlighted the need for greater action to prevent such tragedies in the future, with many calling for improved search and rescue operations, increased funding for migrant support services, and more humane treatment of asylum seekers.\n\n# See Also\n\n* European migrant crisis\n* List of migrant vessel incidents on the Mediterranean Sea\n* Immigration to Greece\n\n# Note\n\nThis article is based on available information and may be updated as new details emerge.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Messenia_migrant_boat_disaster\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#The migrant boat, the Adriana\n#Distress calls and response\n#Capsizing\n#Victims\n#Search, rescue, and detention\n##Protests\n#Response\n#Judicial proceedings\n#Investigations\n#Reactions\n#See also\n#Note\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Jackson Women's Health Organization\n=============================================\n\nDobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization is a landmark United States Supreme Court case that overturned the constitutional right to abortion established in Roe v. Wade (1973) and Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992). The decision, announced on June 24, 2022, has far-reaching implications for reproductive rights, healthcare, and the role of the judiciary in American society.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nThe Dobbs case has its roots in the evolving landscape of abortion laws and judicial interpretations in the United States.\n\n### Common law\n\nAbortion has been a part of human society for centuries, with varying levels of acceptance and regulation. In the United States, abortion was not uncommon in the 18th and 19th centuries, but it was not until the mid-20th century that the issue gained widespread attention and controversy.\n\n### Constitutional right\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade (1973) established a woman's constitutional right to abortion, citing the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court held that the right to abortion was part of a broader right to privacy and that it was essential to a woman's autonomy and self-determination.\n\n### Evolution of the composition of the Supreme Court\n\nIn the decades following Roe, the Supreme Court's composition underwent significant changes, with the appointment of more conservative justices. This shift in the court's balance had a profound impact on its approach to abortion cases, culminating in the Dobbs decision.\n\nGestational Age Act\n-------------------\n\nIn 2018, the Mississippi Legislature passed the Gestational Age Act, which banned most abortions after 15 weeks of gestation. The law was challenged by Jackson Women's Health Organization, the only remaining abortion clinic in Mississippi, on the grounds that it was unconstitutional under Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey.\n\n### Lower courts\n\nThe district court and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals both ruled in favor of the clinic, holding that the law was indeed unconstitutional. The state of Mississippi appealed to the Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the case.\n\nSupreme Court\n-------------\n\nThe Supreme Court's consideration of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization was marked by intense scrutiny and debate.\n\n### Oral argument\n\nOn December 1, 2021, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the case. The justices questioned the lawyers for both sides, exploring the constitutional implications of the Gestational Age Act and the potential consequences of overturning Roe v. Wade.\n\n### Leaked draft opinion\n\nOn May 2, 2022, a draft opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito was leaked to the press, revealing that the court was poised to overturn Roe v. Wade. The leak sparked widespread controversy and protests, with many calling for the impeachment of the justices and others demanding greater transparency and accountability.\n\n#### Reactions\n\nThe leak of the draft opinion sparked a firestorm of reactions, with many politicians, activists, and ordinary citizens weighing in on the issue. Some hailed the potential overturning of Roe as a victory for life and the unborn, while others condemned it as a catastrophic blow to women's rights and reproductive freedom.\n\n#### Investigation\n\nThe Supreme Court launched an investigation into the leak, which is ongoing. The court's marshal, Gail Curley, has been tasked with identifying the source of the leak and determining the circumstances surrounding its release.\n\nOpinions\n--------\n\nOn June 24, 2022, the Supreme Court released its decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization.\n\n### Majority opinion\n\nThe majority opinion, written by Justice Samuel Alito, held that the constitutional right to abortion established in Roe v. Wade was no longer valid. The court found that the right to abortion was not deeply rooted in American history and tradition and that the Constitution did not explicitly protect it.\n\n### Concurrences\n\nJustices Clarence Thomas and Brett Kavanaugh wrote concurring opinions, agreeing with the majority's decision but offering additional arguments and insights. Justice Thomas argued that the court should reconsider other precedents, such as Griswold v. Connecticut (1965), which established the right to contraception. Justice Kavanaugh emphasized the importance of returning the issue of abortion to the states.\n\n### Concurrence in judgment\n\nChief Justice John Roberts wrote a concurring opinion, agreeing with the majority's decision to uphold the Gestational Age Act but disagreeing with the majority's reasoning. Chief Justice Roberts argued that the court should have taken a more incremental approach, rather than overturning Roe v. Wade entirely.\n\n### Dissent\n\nThe dissenting opinion, written by Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan, vigorously opposed the majority's decision, arguing that it was a catastrophic blow to women's rights and reproductive freedom. The dissenters warned that the decision would have far-reaching consequences, including the erosion of trust in the judiciary and the exacerbation of social and economic inequalities.\n\nImpact\n-------\n\nThe Dobbs decision has had a profound impact on American society, with far-reaching consequences for reproductive rights, healthcare, and the role of the judiciary.\n\n### Pre-decision\n\nIn the months leading up to the decision, many states passed laws restricting abortion, anticipating the potential overturning of Roe v. Wade. Some states, such as Texas, passed laws banning abortion after six weeks of gestation, while others, such as Oklahoma, passed laws making it a felony to perform an abortion.\n\n### Post-decision\n\nIn the aftermath of the decision, many states moved to restrict abortion even further. Some states, such as Missouri and South Dakota, banned abortion entirely, while others, such as Alabama and Arkansas, banned abortion after fetal heartbeat detection.\n\n#### State laws restricting abortion\n\nIn the wake of the Dobbs decision, many states have enacted laws restricting abortion. Some of these laws have been challenged in court, while others have gone into effect.\n\n##### EMTALA and federal preemption\n\nThe Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) requires hospitals to provide emergency medical treatment, including abortion, to patients in life-threatening situations. However, some states have argued that EMTALA does not preempt state laws restricting abortion. The Biden administration has taken the position that EMTALA does preempt state laws, and the issue is currently being litigated.\n\n#### State laws expanding abortion access\n\nSome states, such as California and New York, have moved to expand abortion access in the wake of the Dobbs decision. These states have passed laws protecting abortion providers and ensuring access to abortion services.\n\n#### Congressional proposals\n\nIn response to the Dobbs decision, some members of Congress have proposed legislation to codify Roe v. Wade and protect reproductive rights. However, these proposals have been met with resistance from Republicans and are unlikely to pass.\n\n#### Executive action by President Biden\n\nPresident Biden has taken executive action to protect reproductive rights, including signing an executive order protecting access to abortion medication and ensuring that federal agencies provide accurate information about abortion services.\n\n#### Medical abortion, in vitro fertilization, and other processes\n\nThe Dobbs decision has raised concerns about access to medical abortion, in vitro fertilization, and other reproductive health services. Some states have moved to restrict access to these services, while others have sought to protect them.\n\n#### Data privacy\n\nThe Dobbs decision has also raised concerns about data privacy, particularly in relation to online searches and digital health records. Some states have moved to protect data privacy, while others have sought to use data to enforce abortion restrictions.\n\n#### 2022 and 2024 United States election seasons\n\nThe Dobbs decision is likely to play a significant role in the 2022 and 2024 United States election seasons, with many candidates and political parties taking positions on reproductive rights and abortion.\n\n#### Effects on abortion rates\n\nThe Dobbs decision is likely to have a significant impact on abortion rates, particularly in states with restrictive abortion laws. Some studies have suggested that abortion rates may increase in states with more permissive laws, while others have suggested that abortion rates may decrease overall.\n\n#### Effects on infant mortality\n\nThe Dobbs decision may also have an impact on infant mortality rates, particularly in states with restrictive abortion laws. Some studies have suggested that infant mortality rates may increase in states with more restrictive laws, while others have suggested that infant mortality rates may decrease overall.\n\nReaction\n----------\n\nThe Dobbs decision has sparked a wide range of reactions, from politicians and activists to ordinary citizens.\n\n### Legal journalists\n\nMany legal journalists have commented on the Dobbs decision, analyzing its implications and potential consequences.\n\n### Political\n\n#### Support\n\nSome politicians, particularly Republicans, have hailed the Dobbs decision as a victory for life and the unborn.\n\n#### Opposition\n\nOther politicians, particularly Democrats, have condemned the Dobbs decision as a catastrophic blow to women's rights and reproductive freedom.\n\n### Religious\n\nSome religious leaders have welcomed the Dobbs decision, seeing it as a victory for their values and principles.\n\n### Civil rights\n\nMany civil rights organizations have condemned the Dobbs decision, arguing that it is a setback for social justice and equality.\n\n### Health and education\n\nSome health and education organizations have expressed concerns about the Dobbs decision, arguing that it will have far-reaching consequences for women's health and education.\n\n### International\n\nThe Dobbs decision has sparked international condemnation, with many countries expressing concern about the erosion of reproductive rights in the United States.\n\n### News organizations\n\nMany news organizations have covered the Dobbs decision, providing analysis and commentary on its implications and potential consequences.\n\n### Public\n\nThe Dobbs decision has sparked widespread public debate and discussion, with many ordinary citizens weighing in on the issue.\n\n### Corporate and celebrity\n\nSome corporations and celebrities have taken positions on the Dobbs decision, with some expressing support for reproductive rights and others expressing opposition.\n\nLegacy\n----------\n\nThe Dobbs decision is likely to have a profound and lasting impact on American society, with far-reaching consequences for reproductive rights, healthcare, and the role of the judiciary.\n\n### Cultural and political effects\n\nThe Dobbs decision may have significant cultural and political effects, including the erosion of trust in the judiciary and the exacerbation of social and economic inequalities.\n\n### Medical and sociological effects\n\nThe Dobbs decision may also have significant medical and sociological effects, including the restriction of access to reproductive health services and the exacerbation of health disparities.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Roe v.

The protests were sparked by a group of truckers who opposed the Canadian government's COVID-19 vaccine mandate for cross-border travel. The protests quickly gained momentum and spread to other parts of the country, with demonstrators blocking roads, highways, and border crossings.\n\n#Background\n\n##Protest goals\n\nThe main goal of the protest was to pressure the Canadian government to lift its COVID-19 vaccine mandate for cross-border travel. The protesters argued that the mandate was an infringement on their rights and freedoms, and that it was causing economic hardship for truckers and other individuals who relied on cross-border travel for their livelihoods.\n\n##Initial events and the start of the protest\n\nThe protest began on January 15, 2022, when a group of truckers from Vancouver, British Columbia, set out on a cross-country journey to Ottawa, the capital city of Canada. The truckers were joined by other protesters along the way, and by the time they reached Ottawa, the group had grown to thousands of people.\n\n###American influence\n\nThe protest was influenced by similar protests in the United States, where truckers and other groups had been protesting against COVID-19 vaccine mandates and other government restrictions. Some American politicians and media figures, including Donald Trump and Tucker Carlson, expressed support for the Canadian protesters.\n\n###Fundraising\n\nThe protest was funded in part through online donations, which were solicited through social media platforms and crowdfunding websites. The protest organizers claimed to have raised millions of dollars in donations, although the exact amount is not known.\n\n###Donor list hacked\n\nIn February 2022, a hacker released a list of donors to the protest, which included names, addresses, and donation amounts. The list was published online, and it sparked controversy and debate about the sources of funding for the protest.\n\n##Vaccine mandates and passports\n\nThe Canadian government had implemented a COVID-19 vaccine mandate for cross-border travel in November 2021, which required all travelers to show proof of vaccination before entering the country. The mandate was part of a broader effort to slow the spread of COVID-19 and protect public health.\n\n###Vaccination requirements for US–Canada cross-border travel\n\nThe vaccine mandate applied to all travelers, including truckers, who were required to show proof of vaccination before crossing the border from the United States. The mandate was enforced by Canadian border officials, who turned away unvaccinated travelers and imposed fines on those who failed to comply.\n\n#Convoy to Ottawa\n\nThe convoy of truckers and protesters set out from Vancouver on January 15, 2022, and traveled across the country, stopping in cities and towns along the way. The convoy was met with both support and opposition, with some people cheering them on and others protesting against them.\n\n#Ottawa protest\n\nThe convoy arrived in Ottawa on January 28, 2022, and thousands of protesters gathered on Parliament Hill, the seat of the Canadian government. The protest was peaceful at first, but it soon turned confrontational, with protesters clashing with police and blocking streets and highways.\n\n##Peak size of Parliament Hill demonstration\n\nAt its peak, the protest on Parliament Hill drew tens of thousands of people, making it one of the largest demonstrations in Canadian history.\n\n##Desecration and community harassment\n\nSome protesters desecrated war memorials and harassed local residents, which sparked widespread condemnation and outrage.\n\n##Ottawa protests and entrenchment\n\nThe protest in Ottawa continued for several weeks, with protesters setting up a makeshift camp on Parliament Hill and refusing to leave. The protest was marked by clashes between protesters and police, as well as by acts of vandalism and harassment.\n\n##After clearance\n\nAfter the police cleared the protest camp on February 19, 2022, many protesters left Ottawa, but some remained in the city, vowing to continue their fight against the vaccine mandate.\n\n#Major blockades\n\nIn addition to the protest in Ottawa, there were several major blockades of roads and highways across Canada, including at the Alberta-Montana and Ontario-Michigan border crossings.\n\n##Alberta–Montana\n\nA group of protesters blocked the Coutts border crossing in Alberta, which connects to Montana in the United States. The blockade lasted for several days, causing disruptions to trade and commerce.\n\n##Ontario–Michigan\n\nAnother group of protesters blocked the Ambassador Bridge, which connects Windsor, Ontario, to Detroit, Michigan. The blockade lasted for several days, causing disruptions to trade and commerce.\n\n#Participants and response\n\n##Groups\n\nThe protest involved a wide range of groups and individuals, including truckers, farmers, and small business owners. Some groups, such as the Freedom Convoy, were organized and had a clear set of demands, while others were more spontaneous and disorganized.\n\n##Counter-protests\n\nThere were several counter-protests against the convoy and the vaccine mandate protests, which were organized by groups that supported the government's public health measures.\n\n##Ottawa Police Service response\n\nThe Ottawa Police Service (OPS) was criticized for its handling of the protest, with some accusing the force of being too lenient and others accusing it of being too heavy-handed.\n\n##Integrated Command Centre response\n\nThe Integrated Command Centre (ICC) was established to coordinate the response to the protest, which involved the OPS, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), and other agencies.\n\n###Clearance\n\nThe ICC oversaw the clearance of the protest camp on February 19, 2022, which involved the use of riot police and other heavy-handed tactics.\n\n##Municipal response\n\nThe City of Ottawa declared a state of emergency on February 6, 2022, which gave the city additional powers to respond to the protest.\n\n##Provincial response\n\nThe Province of Ontario declared a state of emergency on February 11, 2022, which gave the province additional powers to respond to the protest.\n\n##Federal response\n\nThe federal government invoked the Emergencies Act on February 14, 2022, which gave the government additional powers to respond to the protest.\n\n###Emergencies Act\n\nThe Emergencies Act was used to give the government the power to freeze bank accounts and impose fines on protesters, as well as to deploy the military to support the police.\n\n#Related events\n\n##Other border crossing obstructions\n\nIn addition to the blockades at the Alberta-Montana and Ontario-Michigan border crossings, there were several other border crossing obstructions across Canada.\n\n###British Columbia–Washington\n\nA group of protesters blocked the
