It was originally placed atop the Ashoka Pillar at Sarnath, a site near Varanasi in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. The capital is a masterwork of ancient Indian art and a symbol of the country's rich cultural heritage.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\nThe Lion Capital of Ashoka was erected during the reign of Emperor Ashoka, who ruled the Mauryan Empire from 269 BCE to 232 BCE. Ashoka was a prominent Buddhist king who converted to Buddhism after a brutal war in Kalinga. He then devoted his life to spreading the teachings of Buddhism throughout his empire. The Lion Capital is believed to have been sculpted by skilled artisans of the Mauryan period, who were known for their expertise in stone carving.\n\nThe capital was likely built to commemorate the establishment of the Buddhist sangha, or monastic community, at Sarnath. The site was an important center of Buddhist learning and culture, and the Lion Capital was a prominent symbol of the faith.\n\nExcavation and Display\n----------------------\n\nThe Lion Capital of Ashoka was discovered in 1851 by British archaeologist Alexander Cunningham, who was excavating the site of Sarnath. The capital was found in fragments, and it took several years to reassemble the sculpture. After its discovery, the capital was moved to the Lucknow Museum, where it was put on display.\n\nIn 1997, the Indian government decided to move the Lion Capital to the Rashtrapati Bhavan, the official residence of the President of India, in New Delhi. The capital was reinstalled in the forecourt of the Rashtrapati Bhavan, where it remains on display today.\n\nDescription\n-----------\n\nThe Lion Capital of Ashoka is a magnificent sculpture that depicts four lions sitting back to back on a circular base. The lions are carved out of a single block of polished sandstone and are incredibly lifelike. Each lion is about 1.5 meters in height and is depicted in a naturalistic pose, with its legs tucked under its body.\n\nThe lions are arranged in a circular formation, with each lion facing a different direction. This arrangement is meant to symbolize the four cardinal directions: north, south, east, and west. The circular base of the capital is decorated with intricate carvings of lions, elephants, and other animals.\n\nSymbolism\n----------\n\nThe Lion Capital of Ashoka is a richly symbolic sculpture that conveys several important messages. The lions are meant to represent courage, strength, and royalty, while the circular base represents the unity and harmony of the empire.\n\nThe four directions represented by the lions are also symbolic of the four virtues of Buddhism: loving-kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity. The lions are meant to remind the viewer of the importance of cultivating these virtues in order to achieve enlightenment.\n\nInfluences\n----------\n\nThe Lion Capital of Ashoka has had a profound influence on Indian art and architecture. The capital's design and motifs have been borrowed and adapted in countless other sculptures and buildings throughout Indian history.\n\nThe capital's influence can also be seen in other Asian cultures, such as Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia, where similar lion sculptures can be found. The Lion Capital of Ashoka is a testament to the rich cultural exchange and diffusion that took place throughout ancient Asia.\n\nLegacy\n-------\n\nThe Lion Capital of Ashoka is a beloved national symbol of India and is featured on the country's national emblem. The capital's image is used on Indian currency, passports, and other official documents.\n\nThe Lion Capital is also a powerful symbol of India's rich cultural heritage and its importance in the history of Buddhism. The capital's message of peace, harmony, and unity continues to inspire people around the world today.\n\nReconstructions\n--------------\n\nSeveral reconstructions of the Lion Capital of Ashoka have been made over the years. One of the most notable reconstructions is the one located at the Sarnath Museum, which was built in the 1950s.\n\nAnother reconstruction can be found at the Rashtrapati Bhavan, where a replica of the capital is displayed in the forecourt. This replica was built in the 1990s and is made of marble.\n\nRelated Sculpture\n-----------------\n\nThe Lion Capital of Ashoka is part of a larger corpus of ancient Indian sculpture that includes other notable works such as the Buddha of Sarnath and the Yaksha sculptures of Patna.\n\nThese sculptures share similar motifs and design elements, such as the use of lions and other animals as symbols of power and royalty. They also demonstrate the high level of craftsmanship and artistry that was characteristic of ancient Indian sculpture.\n\nNotes\n-----\n\n* The Lion Capital of Ashoka is also known as the Sarnath Lion Capital or the Ashoka Pillar.\n* The capital is made of polished sandstone and is about 2.5 meters in height.\n* The lions are arranged in a circular formation, with each lion facing a different direction.\n* The circular base of the capital is decorated with intricate carvings of lions, elephants, and other animals.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n* This article does not include any references or citations.\n\nCited Works\n------------\n\n* This article does not include any cited works.\n\nFurther Reading\n---------------\n\n* For further reading on the Lion Capital of Ashoka, see the following books and articles:\n\t+ \"The Art of Ancient India\" by Stella Kramrisch\n\t+ \"The Lion Capital of Ashoka\" by Alexander Cunningham\n\t+ \"The Sarnath Lion Capital\" by the Indian Archaeological Survey\n\nExternal Links\n---------------\n\n* For more information on the Lion Capital of Ashoka, see the following websites:\n\t+ The official website of the Rashtrapati Bhavan\n\t+ The website of the Indian Archaeological Survey\n\t+ The website of the Sarnath Museum", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Lion_Capital_of_Ashoka\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n#Excavation and display\n#Description\n#Symbolism\n#Influences\n#Legacy\n#Reconstructions\n#Related sculpture\n#Notes\n#References\n#Cited works\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The election was also notable for the high number of candidates vying for various positions, with over 2,000 aspirants seeking to be elected to various offices.\n\n#Electoral system\n\nKenya uses a mixed electoral system, with a combination of first-past-the-post and proportional representation systems. The President is elected through a two-round system, where a candidate must receive at least 50% + 1 of the total votes cast to win in the first round.

The term of the current assembly is set to expire on March 22, 2023.\n\n# Background\n\nThe 2023 Tripura Legislative Assembly election is significant as it will be a test for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government, which has been in power since 2018. The election will also be crucial for the opposition parties, including the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI(M)) and the Indian National Congress (INC), which are looking to regain power in the state.\n\n## TTAADC elections\n\nIn April 2021, the Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council (TTAADC) elections were held, in which the Tipra Motha Party, a new party formed by Pradyot Kishore Deb Barman, won 18 out of 28 seats. The BJP and its ally, the Indigenous Peoples Front of Tripura (IPFT), won 9 seats. The CPI(M) and the INC failed to win any seats. The TTAADC elections were seen as a significant setback for the CPI(M) and the INC, which had traditionally enjoyed strong support in the tribal areas of the state.\n\n## Major political defections\n\nIn the run-up to the 2023 assembly election, there have been several major political defections in the state. In June 2022, Sudip Roy Barman, a senior leader of the INC, defected to the BJP. Barman was the leader of the opposition in the Tripura Legislative Assembly and had been a vocal critic of the BJP government. His defection was seen as a major blow to the INC, which has been struggling to regain its foothold in the state.\n\n# Schedule\n\nThe election schedule was announced by the Election Commission of India (ECI) on January 18, 2023. According to the schedule, the election will be held on February 16, 2023, and the counting of votes will take place on March 2, 2023.\n\n# Parties and Alliances\n\n## National Democratic Alliance\n\nThe BJP is contesting the election as part of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). The NDA also includes the IPFT, which is a tribal-based party. The BJP and the IPFT have been allies since 2018, and their alliance has been instrumental in the BJP's success in the state.\n\n## Secular Democratic Forces\n\nThe CPI(M) and the INC have formed an alliance, known as the Secular Democratic Forces (SDF), to contest the election. The SDF also includes several smaller parties, including the Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP) and the All India Forward Bloc (AIFB).\n\n## Tipra Motha Party\n\nThe Tipra Motha Party, which won the TTAADC elections in 2021, is contesting the election independently. The party has been critical of the BJP government's handling of tribal issues and has promised to work towards greater autonomy for the tribal areas of the state.\n\n## Others\n\nSeveral smaller parties, including the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), are also contesting the election.\n\n# Candidates\n\nThe BJP has fielded candidates in all 60 constituencies, while the CPI(M) and the INC have fielded candidates in 47 and 53 constituencies, respectively. The Tipra Motha Party has fielded candidates in 42 constituencies.\n\n# Issues\n\n## 10323 Teachers batch\n\nThe BJP government's decision to terminate the services of 10,323 teachers, who were recruited in 2010, has been a major issue in the election. The teachers have been protesting against the government's decision, which they claim is arbitrary and unjust.\n\n## Tipraland Movement\n\nThe Tipraland movement, which demands a separate state for the indigenous people of Tripura, has been a major issue in the election. The Tipra Motha Party has promised to work towards the creation of a separate state, while the BJP and the CPI(M) have opposed the demand.\n\n## Bru refugees\n\nThe issue of Bru refugees, who are currently living in relief camps in Tripura, has also been a major issue in the election. The BJP government has promised to resettle the refugees in the state, while the CPI(M) and the INC have criticized the government's handling of the issue.\n\n# Campaigns\n\n## Bharatiya Janata Party\n\nThe BJP has launched a high-profile campaign, which includes rallies and public meetings addressed by top leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah. The party has also used social media extensively to reach out to voters.\n\n## Communist Party of India (Marxist)\n\nThe CPI(M) has launched a grassroots campaign, which includes door-to-door canvassing and public meetings. The party has also used social media to reach out to voters.\n\n## Indian National Congress\n\nThe INC has launched a campaign, which includes public meetings and rallies. The party has also used social media to reach out to voters.\n\n## Tipra Motha Party\n\nThe Tipra Motha Party has launched a campaign, which includes public meetings and rallies.

On January 28, 2023, a Tipra Motha Party worker was attacked by alleged IPFT supporters in the Gomati district.\n\n# Surveys & Polls\n\nSeveral opinion polls have been conducted in the run-up to the election. A poll conducted by the India Today group in January 2023 predicted a close contest between the BJP and the CPI(M), with the BJP likely to win 32-35 seats and the CPI(M) likely to win 25-28 seats. A poll conducted by the ABP News group in January 2023 predicted a BJP victory, with the party likely to win 38-42 seats.\n\n# Results\n\nThe results of the election will be announced on March 2, 2023.\n\n## Results by alliance and party\n\nThe results will be announced by the ECI, which will provide a detailed breakdown of the votes polled by each alliance and party.\n\n## Results by district\n\nThe results will also be announced by district, which will provide a detailed breakdown of the votes polled by each alliance and party in each district.\n\n## Results by constituency\n\nThe results will also be announced by constituency, which will provide a detailed breakdown of the votes polled by each candidate in each constituency.\n\n# Government formation\n\nThe party or alliance that wins a majority of seats will form the government.

The mission involves crashing a spacecraft into an asteroid to alter its trajectory, providing valuable insights into the feasibility of this technique for preventing asteroid impacts on Earth.\n\n**Mission History**\n\nThe DART mission was conceived in response to the growing concern about the potential threat posed by near-Earth asteroids (NEAs). In 2015, NASA announced plans to develop a mission that would demonstrate the ability to deflect an asteroid using a kinetic impactor. The mission was initially scheduled to launch in 2020, but due to technical and funding issues, the launch was delayed to 2021.\n\n**Description**\n\n### Spacecraft\n\nThe DART spacecraft is a small, cube-shaped vehicle measuring 1.2 meters (4 feet) on each side. It is equipped with a range of instruments and systems designed to support the mission objectives.\n\n#### Camera\n\nThe DART spacecraft is equipped with a high-resolution camera called the Didymos Reconnaissance and Asteroid Camera for Optical navigation (DRACO). The camera is designed to capture images of the target asteroid, Dimorphos, and its larger companion, Didymos, during the approach phase. The images will help mission controllers to refine the spacecraft's trajectory and ensure a precise impact.\n\n#### Solar Arrays\n\nThe DART spacecraft is powered by two solar arrays, each measuring 2.4 meters (8 feet) long. The solar arrays provide the necessary power for the spacecraft's systems and instruments.\n\n#### Antenna\n\nThe DART spacecraft is equipped with a high-gain antenna that will be used to communicate with Earth during the mission. The antenna will transmit data and images back to Earth, providing mission controllers with critical information about the spacecraft's performance and the outcome of the impact.\n\n#### Ion Thruster\n\nThe DART spacecraft is equipped with an ion thruster, which is a type of electric propulsion system. The ion thruster will be used to make any necessary adjustments to the spacecraft's trajectory during the approach phase.\n\n### Secondary Spacecraft\n\nIn addition to the DART spacecraft, a secondary spacecraft called the Light Italian CubeSat for Imaging of Asteroids (LICIACube) will be launched on the same mission. LICIACube is a small, cube-shaped spacecraft developed by the Italian Space Agency (ASI). It will fly by the asteroid system and capture images of the impact, providing an independent perspective on the event.\n\n### Effect of the Impact on Dimorphos and Didymos\n\nThe impact of the DART spacecraft on Dimorphos is expected to cause a significant change in the asteroid's trajectory. The exact effect of the impact will depend on various factors, including the size and shape of the asteroid, the velocity of the impact, and the angle of incidence. Mission scientists expect that the impact will cause a change in the asteroid's orbital period of several minutes.\n\n### Observations of the Impact\n\nThe impact of the DART spacecraft on Dimorphos will be observed by a range of telescopes and spacecraft, including the Hubble Space Telescope, the James Webb Space Telescope, and the LICIACube spacecraft. The observations will provide valuable insights into the effects of the impact and the behavior of the asteroid system.\n\n### Follow-up Mission\n\nA follow-up mission, called the European Space Agency's (ESA) Hera mission, is planned to launch in 2024. The Hera mission will visit the Didymos asteroid system and conduct a detailed survey of the asteroid's shape, size, and composition. The mission will also study the effects of the DART impact on the asteroid's orbit and rotation.\n\n### AIDA Mission Architecture\n\nThe DART mission is part of a larger international collaboration called the Asteroid Impact and Deflection Assessment (AIDA) mission. The AIDA mission aims to develop a comprehensive strategy for preventing asteroid impacts on Earth. The mission involves a range of space agencies and organizations, including NASA, ESA, and ASI.\n\n**Mission Profile**\n\n### Target Asteroid\n\nThe target asteroid for the DART mission is Dimorphos, a small, near-Earth asteroid that orbits the larger asteroid Didymos. Dimorphos is a rocky, irregularly shaped asteroid measuring about 160 meters (525 feet) in diameter.\n\n### Preflight Preparations\n\nThe DART spacecraft underwent a range of preflight tests and preparations, including environmental testing, propulsion system checks, and communications tests.\n\n### Launch\n\nThe DART spacecraft was launched on November 24, 2021, aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California.\n\n### Transit\n\nThe DART spacecraft will travel through space for about 10 months, covering a distance of over 11 million kilometers (6.8 million miles). During this time, the spacecraft will conduct a range of navigation and communication checks.\n\n### Course of the Impact\n\nThe DART spacecraft will approach the Dimorphos asteroid at a speed of about 6.6 kilometers per second (14,760 miles per hour). The impact is expected to occur on September 26, 2022.\n\n#### Sequence of Operations for Impact\n\nThe sequence of operations for the impact will involve a range of critical steps, including:\n\n1. Final navigation and guidance checks\n2. Activation of the DRACO camera\n3. Transmission of images and data back to Earth\n4. Impact with the asteroid\n5. Post-impact observations and data transmission\n\n**Gallery**\n\n* DART spacecraft illustration\n* Dimorphos asteroid illustration\n* Didymos asteroid illustration\n* LICIACube spacecraft illustration\n* DART spacecraft launch image\n* DART spacecraft in transit image\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Asteroid Impact and Deflection Assessment (AIDA) mission\n* Hera mission\n* Near-Earth asteroids (NEAs)\n* Asteroid deflection and disruption missions\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The DART mission is a NASA space mission aimed at testing a method for deflecting potentially hazardous asteroids.\n* The mission involves crashing a spacecraft into an asteroid to alter its trajectory.\n* The target asteroid for the DART mission is Dimorphos, a small, near-Earth asteroid that orbits the larger asteroid Didymos.\n\n**References**\n\n* NASA DART mission website\n* European Space Agency (ESA) Hera mission website\n* Italian Space Agency (ASI) LICIACube mission website\n\n**External Links**\n\n* NASA DART mission website\n* European Space Agency (ESA) Hera mission website\n* Italian Space Agency (ASI) LICIACube mission website", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Double_Asteroid_Redirection_Test\" following this outline:\n\n#Mission history\n#Description\n##Spacecraft\n###Camera\n###Solar arrays\n###Antenna\n###Ion thruster\n##Secondary spacecraft\n##Effect of the impact on Dimorphos and Didymos\n##Observations of the impact\n##Follow-up mission\n##AIDA mission architecture\n#Mission profile\n##Target asteroid\n##Preflight preparations\n##Launch\n##Transit\n##Course of the impact\n###Sequence of operations for impact\n#Gallery\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The incident was a significant turning point in the conflict and had far-reaching implications for the Russian military and the ongoing war.\n\n#Background\n\nThe Moskva was a Slava-class cruiser commissioned in 1983 and was one of the largest warships in the Russian Navy. It was 186 meters (610 feet) long, with a displacement of 11,490 tons and a crew of over 500 sailors. The ship was equipped with a range of armaments, including anti-ship missiles, air defense systems, and guns.\n\nIn the months leading up to the sinking, the Moskva had been involved in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, taking part in the blockade of Ukrainian ports and providing naval gunfire support for Russian ground troops. The ship's presence in the Black Sea was seen as a symbol of Russian power and a key factor in the country's ability to project force in the region.\n\n#Sinking\n\n##Ukrainian account\n\nAccording to the Ukrainian military, the Moskva was struck by two Neptune anti-ship missiles fired from the coast of Odessa Oblast. The missiles, which have a range of over 280 kilometers (170 miles), were said to have hit the ship's hull, causing significant damage and fires. The Ukrainian account claimed that the ship sank several hours later, with all hands on board.\n\n##Russian account\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense initially reported that the Moskva had suffered a fire due to a malfunction of the ship's ammunition, which had exploded and caused significant damage. The ministry claimed that the crew had been evacuated and that the ship was being towed to a safe location for repairs. However, several days later, Russia acknowledged that the ship had sunk, blaming the incident on a combination of factors, including bad weather and a malfunction of the ship's systems.\n\n##Other early observations\n\nIn the hours following the sinking, there were conflicting reports about the incident, with some sources claiming that the ship had been attacked by Ukrainian forces, while others reported that it had suffered a technical malfunction. Images and video posted on social media showed the ship listing to one side and on fire, but the exact circumstances of the sinking remained unclear.\n\n##Missile strike\n\nAnalysis of satellite imagery and video footage of the sinking ship later confirmed that it had been hit by a missile strike. Experts pointed to the presence of a clear impact crater on the ship's hull, as well as the characteristic damage pattern caused by an anti-ship missile. The evidence suggested that the Ukrainian account of the sinking was accurate, and that the Moskva had been struck by one or more Neptune missiles.\n\n##Images and video of the sinking ship\n\nIn the days following the sinking, a number of images and videos emerged showing the Moskva in its final moments. The footage, which was captured by satellites and drones, showed the ship listing to one side and on fire, with smoke billowing from the hull. The images provided clear evidence of the damage caused by the missile strike and helped to confirm the circumstances of the sinking.\n\n#Casualties\n\nThe exact number of casualties resulting from the sinking of the Moskva remains unclear. The Russian military initially reported that one sailor had been killed and 27 were missing, but later acknowledged that the true number of fatalities was likely to be much higher. Ukrainian sources claimed that the entire crew of over 500 sailors had been killed, but this figure has not been officially confirmed.\n\n#Impact\n\nThe sinking of the Moskva had significant implications for the Russian military and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. The loss of the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet was a major blow to Russian naval power and prestige, and it raised questions about the country's ability to project force in the region. The incident also highlighted the effectiveness of Ukrainian anti-ship missiles and the country's ability to defend itself against Russian aggression.\n\n#Aftermath\n\nIn the aftermath of the sinking, Russia launched a series of airstrikes against Ukrainian targets, including military bases and ports. The incident also led to a significant escalation of tensions between Russia and NATO, with the alliance condemning the Russian aggression and pledging to increase support for Ukraine.\n\nThe sinking of the Moskva also had significant domestic implications for Russia, with the incident sparking widespread criticism of the country's military leadership and the handling of the conflict in Ukraine. The incident was seen as a major embarrassment for the Russian government and highlighted the need for reform and modernization of the country's military.\n\n#See also\n\n* 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* Russian Black Sea Fleet\n* Slava-class cruiser\n* Neptune anti-ship missile", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Sinking_of_the_Moskva\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Sinking\n##Ukrainian account\n##Russian account\n##Other early observations\n##Missile strike\n##Images and video of the sinking ship\n#Casualties\n#Impact\n#Aftermath\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Prigozhin's rise to prominence has been marked by controversy, including allegations of involvement in organized crime, election interference, and human rights abuses.\n\n# Early life and education\n\nPrigozhin was born on June 1, 1961, in Leningrad, Soviet Union (now Saint Petersburg, Russia). His early life is not well-documented, but it is known that he grew up in a poor family and was raised by his mother, a single parent. Prigozhin attended a local school and later studied at a technical college, where he trained to become an engineer.\n\n## Criminal history and imprisonment\n\nIn the 1980s, Prigozhin was convicted of theft and robbery and sentenced to 12 years in prison. He served 9 years before being released in 1990. After his release, Prigozhin began to build a business empire, starting with a hot dog stand in Saint Petersburg.\n\n# Early career and rise to prominence\n\nPrigozhin's early business ventures were successful, and he quickly expanded into the food industry, opening several restaurants and cafes in Saint Petersburg. In the 1990s, he began to attract the attention of Russian officials, including Vladimir Putin, who was then the city's deputy mayor. Prigozhin's business empire continued to grow, and he became known as one of Putin's favorite businessmen.\n\n# Wagner Group\n\nThe Wagner Group is a private military company founded by Prigozhin in 2014. The group is believed to be staffed by former Russian military personnel and has been involved in various conflicts around the world, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Syrian Civil War, and the Central African Republic conflict.\n\n## Russian invasion of Ukraine\n\nThe Wagner Group has been accused of playing a key role in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which began in 2014. The group has been involved in several high-profile battles, including the Battle of Debaltseve and the Battle of Donetsk Airport. Prigozhin has denied any involvement in the conflict, but evidence suggests that the Wagner Group has received significant support from the Russian government.\n\n## Conflict with Russian Ministry of Defense\n\nIn 2022, Prigozhin publicly criticized the Russian Ministry of Defense, accusing them of incompetence and corruption. The criticism sparked a public feud between Prigozhin and Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, with Prigozhin accusing Shoigu of being \"afraid of war.\"\n\n## Prigozhin as a populist critic\n\nPrigozhin's criticism of the Russian Ministry of Defense has been seen as an attempt to position himself as a populist critic of the Russian government. Prigozhin has long been known for his outspoken views, and his criticism of the government has been seen as a way to build a reputation as a straight-talking, no-nonsense leader.\n\n## June 2023 rebellion\n\nIn June 2023, Prigozhin led a rebellion against the Russian government, accusing them of corruption and incompetence. The rebellion was sparked by a dispute over the Wagner Group's role in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, with Prigozhin accusing the government of trying to take control of the group. The rebellion was ultimately put down, but not before Prigozhin had made several public statements criticizing the government.\n\n# Africa interests\n\nPrigozhin has significant business interests in Africa, including mining and energy companies. He has been accused of using his business empire to further Russian interests on the continent, including by providing military training and equipment to African governments.\n\n# Internet Research Agency\n\nThe Internet Research Agency (IRA) is a Russian troll farm founded by Prigozhin in 2013. The IRA has been accused of interfering in several elections around the world, including the 2016 US presidential election.\n\n## Spin-offs\n\nThe IRA has spawned several spin-offs, including the Federal News Agency (FAN) and the Economic News Agency (ENA). These organizations have been accused of spreading disinformation and propaganda on behalf of the Russian government.\n\n# International sanctions\n\nPrigozhin has been subject to international sanctions, including those imposed by the US, EU, and UK. The sanctions have been imposed in response to his alleged involvement in organized crime, election interference, and human rights abuses.\n\n# U.S. criminal charges\n\nIn 2018, Prigozhin was charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States for his alleged role in interfering in the 2016 US presidential election. The charges were brought by Special Counsel Robert Mueller as part of his investigation into Russian election interference.\n\n# Financial support for Maria Butina in 2019\n\nIn 2019, it was reported that Prigozhin had provided financial support to Maria Butina, a Russian spy who was convicted of infiltrating the NRA and attempting to influence US politics.\n\n# Personal life\n\nPrigozhin is known to be a fan of martial arts and has been involved in several high-profile disputes with business rivals. He has also been accused of using violence and intimidation to silence critics.\n\n# Death\n\nPrigozhin's death has not been confirmed, but there have been several reports of his demise. Some sources have suggested that he may have been killed in a plane crash or by Russian security forces.\n\n# Awards\n\nPrigozhin has received several awards from the Russian government, including the Order of Courage and the Medal of the Order of Merit for the Fatherland.\n\n# Memorials\n\nThere are no known memorials to Prigozhin, but his legacy as a businessman and mercenary leader continues to be felt around the world.\n\n# See also\n\n* Wagner Group\n* Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* Internet Research Agency\n* Maria Butina\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is based on publicly available information and has not been verified by any official sources.\n\n# References\n\nThis article does not include any references.\n\n# External links\n\nThis article does not include any external links.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Yevgeny_Prigozhin\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and education\n##Criminal history and imprisonment\n#Early career and rise to prominence\n#Wagner Group\n##Russian invasion of Ukraine\n##Conflict with Russian Ministry of Defense\n##Prigozhin as a populist critic\n##June 2023 rebellion\n#Africa interests\n#Internet Research Agency\n##Spin-offs\n#International sanctions\n#U.S. criminal charges\n#Financial support for Maria Butina in 2019\n#Personal life\n#Death\n#Awards\n#Memorials\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He was a prominent figure in American politics and played a significant role in shaping the country's development during the early 19th century. Jackson's life was marked by his military career, his presidency, and his commitment to the principles of democracy and limited government.\n\n#Early life and education\n\nAndrew Jackson was born on March 15, 1767, in Waxhaws, a region on the border of North and South Carolina. His parents, Andrew Jackson Sr. and Elizabeth Hutchinson Jackson, were Scottish-Irish immigrants who had settled in the American colonies. Jackson's father died before his birth, and his mother raised him and his two older brothers, Hugh and Robert, on their own. Jackson's early life was marked by poverty and hardship, and he received little formal education.\n\n#Revolutionary War\n\nAt the age of 13, Jackson joined the Continental Army as a courier during the American Revolutionary War. He was captured by British soldiers in 1781, along with his brother Robert, and held as a prisoner of war. Jackson's brother died in captivity, and Andrew was released after a few months. He later served as a messenger and scout for the Continental Army, participating in several battles, including the Battle of Hanging Rock.\n\n#Early career\n\n##Legal career and marriage\n\nAfter the Revolutionary War, Jackson studied law and was admitted to the North Carolina bar in 1787. He moved to Nashville, Tennessee, where he established a successful law practice and became a prominent figure in local politics. In 1797, Jackson married Rachel Donelson Robards, a divorcee with two children. The couple had no children of their own but raised Rachel's children from her previous marriage.\n\n##Early public career\n\nJackson's entry into politics began in 1796, when he was elected to the Tennessee State Legislature. He served in the legislature for several years, advocating for the rights of the common man and opposing the interests of the wealthy elite. In 1797, Jackson was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, where he served for one term before being elected to the U.S. Senate in 1798.\n\n##Planting career and slavery\n\nIn the late 1790s, Jackson began to acquire land and establish a plantation in Tennessee. He became a successful planter and slave owner, owning over 150 slaves at the height of his career. Jackson's views on slavery were complex and nuanced, and he saw it as a necessary institution in the South. However, he also believed that slavery was morally wrong and advocated for its gradual abolition.\n\n##Duel with Dickinson and adventure with Burr\n\nIn 1806, Jackson was involved in a duel with Charles Dickinson, a wealthy planter who had insulted Rachel Jackson. Jackson killed Dickinson in the duel, which cemented his reputation as a fierce and formidable opponent. In 1807, Jackson became embroiled in a scandal involving Aaron Burr, who had been accused of treason. Jackson provided Burr with financial support and helped him to escape to Europe.\n\n#Military career\n\n##War of 1812\n\nJackson's military career resumed during the War of 1812, when he was commissioned as a major general in the Tennessee militia. He played a crucial role in the war, leading troops to victory in several battles, including the Battle of Tallushatchee and the Battle of New Orleans.\n\n###Creek War\n\nIn 1813, Jackson led a campaign against the Creek Nation, a Native American tribe that had allied itself with the British. The campaign was marked by brutal violence and the forced relocation of the Creek people. Jackson's actions in the Creek War were widely criticized, but he remained unapologetic about his tactics.\n\n###Battle of New Orleans\n\nIn January 1815, Jackson led a force of American troops to victory in the Battle of New Orleans, a pivotal battle in the War of 1812. The battle was a decisive American victory, and it cemented Jackson's reputation as a brilliant military strategist.\n\n##First Seminole War\n\nIn 1817, Jackson led a campaign against the Seminole Nation, a Native American tribe that had been resisting American expansion in Florida. The campaign was marked by violence and the forced relocation of the Seminole people. Jackson's actions in the First Seminole War were widely criticized, but he remained unapologetic about his tactics.\n\n#Presidential aspirations\n\n##Election of 1824\n\nIn 1824, Jackson ran for president but lost to John Quincy Adams. The election was marked by controversy and allegations of corruption, and Jackson claimed that he had been robbed of the presidency.\n\n##Election of 1828 and death of Rachel Jackson\n\nIn 1828, Jackson ran for president again and won a decisive victory over John Quincy Adams. However, the campaign was marred by personal tragedy when Rachel Jackson died of a heart attack just days before the election. Jackson was devastated by her death and carried a locket with her picture for the rest of his life.\n\n#Presidency (1829–1837)\n\n##Inauguration\n\nJackson's inauguration in 1829 was marked by controversy and violence. A mob of supporters stormed the White House, causing damage and chaos. Jackson's opponents claimed that the inauguration was a symbol of the \"mob rule\" that would characterize his presidency.\n\n##Reforms and rotation in office\n\nJackson implemented several reforms during his presidency, including the rotation of government officials and the reduction of government spending. He believed that the government should be small and limited, and he opposed the growth of bureaucracy.\n\n##Petticoat affair\n\nIn 1831, Jackson became embroiled in a scandal involving Margaret \"Peggy\" Eaton, the wife of his Secretary of War. Eaton was accused of being a woman of loose morals, and Jackson's opponents used the scandal to attack him. The scandal became known as the \"Petticoat Affair,\" and it damaged Jackson's reputation.\n\n##Indian Removal Act\n\nIn 1830, Jackson signed the Indian Removal Act, which authorized the forced relocation of Native American tribes from their ancestral lands to Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma). The act was widely criticized, and it led to the deaths of thousands of Native Americans.\n\n##Nullification crisis\n\nIn 1832, South Carolina nullified a federal tariff, claiming that it was unconstitutional. Jackson responded by issuing a proclamation that asserted the authority of the federal government and threatened to use force to enforce the tariff. The crisis was eventually resolved through compromise, but it highlighted the growing tensions between the North and South.\n\n##Bank War and Election of 1832\n\n###Bank veto\n\nIn 1832, Jackson vetoed the re-charter of the Second Bank of the United States, claiming that it was unconstitutional and benefited the wealthy elite. The veto was widely criticized, and it led to a split in the Democratic Party.\n\n###Election of 1832\n\nIn 1832, Jackson ran for re-election and won a decisive victory over Henry Clay. The campaign was marked by controversy and violence, and Jackson's opponents claimed that he was a tyrant who was destroying the country.\n\n###Removal of deposits and censure\n\nIn 1833, Jackson ordered the removal of government deposits from the Second Bank of the United States and placed them in state banks. The move was widely criticized, and Jackson was censured by the Senate for his actions.\n\n###Panic of 1837\n\nIn 1837, a financial panic occurred, which was caused in part by Jackson's policies. The panic led to widespread economic hardship and damaged Jackson's reputation.\n\n##Physical assault and assassination attempt\n\nIn 1835, Jackson was the target of an assassination attempt when a man named Richard Lawrence attempted to shoot him. The attempt failed, and Lawrence was later institutionalized for mental illness.\n\n##Slavery\n\nJackson's views on slavery were complex and nuanced. He believed that slavery was morally wrong, but he also believed that it was a necessary institution in the South. He opposed the abolition of slavery, but he also supported the gradual emancipation of slaves.\n\n##Foreign affairs\n\nJackson's foreign policy was marked by controversy and conflict. He opposed the annexation of Texas, but he supported the annexation of Florida. He also clashed with Great Britain over trade and territory.\n\n##Judiciary\n\nJackson's views on the judiciary were critical. He believed that the judiciary had become too powerful and that it was threatening the authority of the executive branch. He opposed the Supreme Court's decision in the case of Worcester v. Georgia, which ruled that the Cherokee Nation was a sovereign entity.\n\n##States admitted to the Union\n\nDuring Jackson's presidency, two states were admitted to the Union: Arkansas and Michigan.\n\n#Later life and death (1837–1845)\n\nAfter leaving office, Jackson returned to his plantation in Tennessee, where he lived until his death in 1845. He remained active in politics, supporting the Democratic Party and opposing the Whig Party.\n\n#Personal life\n\n##Family\n\nJackson's family life was marked by tragedy and hardship. He and his wife, Rachel, had no children of their own, but they raised her two children from her previous marriage.\n\n##Temperament\n\nJackson's temperament was fiery and explosive. He was known for his quick temper and his willingness to fight. He was also known for his loyalty and his commitment to his friends and family.\n\n##Religious faith\n\nJackson's religious faith was complex and nuanced. He was a Presbyterian and believed in the principles of Christianity. However, he also believed in the separation of church and state and opposed the establishment of a national church.\n\n#Legacy\n\nJackson's legacy is complex and contested. He is remembered as a strong leader who expanded democracy and limited government. However, he is also remembered as a ruthless and brutal leader who was responsible for the deaths of thousands of Native Americans. His legacy continues to be debated by historians and scholars today.\n\n#Writings\n\nJackson's writings include his autobiography, which was published in 1835. He also wrote several letters and speeches, which were published posthumously.\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is based on a variety of sources, including biographies, histories, and primary sources.\n\n#References\n\nThis article includes a list of references, which can be found at the end of the article.\n\n#Bibliography\n\n##Biographies\n\n* Remini, Robert V.

The combination of these factors created a highly unstable atmosphere, conducive to the development of tornadoes.\n\n## April 4–5\n\nOn April 4, a strong low-pressure system developed over the southern Great Plains, driving a cold front eastward across the southern United States. As the cold front interacted with the warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico, a dry line developed, stretching from eastern Texas to southern Georgia. The dry line served as a focal point for thunderstorm development, with numerous storms forming along and ahead of the boundary.\n\n## April 6–7\n\nAs the low-pressure system continued to intensify, the cold front accelerated eastward, reaching the eastern seaboard by April 6. The dry line also shifted eastward, eventually merging with the cold front. This led to a significant increase in instability, as the warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico was forced to rise over the cooler air from Canada. The resulting updrafts and downdrafts created an environment favorable for the development of long-lived, intense tornadoes.\n\n# Confirmed tornadoes\n\nThe tornado outbreak sequence of April 4–7, 2022, produced a total of 41 confirmed tornadoes across six states. The following sections provide a summary of the confirmed tornadoes by date.\n\n## April 4 event\n\nOn April 4, five tornadoes touched down across Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas. The strongest tornado of the day occurred in Oklahoma, where an EF2 tornado caused significant damage in the town of Hugo.\n\n## April 5 event\n\nOn April 5, 11 tornadoes were reported across Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. The most significant tornado of the day occurred in Louisiana, where an EF3 tornado caused widespread damage in the city of Monroe.\n\n## April 6 event\n\nApril 6 was the most active day of the outbreak, with 15 tornadoes reported across Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina. The strongest tornado of the day occurred in Georgia, where an EF4 tornado caused catastrophic damage in the city of Pembroke.\n\n## April 7 event\n\nOn April 7, 10 tornadoes touched down across North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. The most significant tornado of the day occurred in South Carolina, where an EF3 tornado caused significant damage in the city of Orangeburg.\n\n## Pembroke–Ellabell–Black Creek, Georgia\n\nOne of the most significant tornadoes of the outbreak occurred on April 6, when an EF4 tornado touched down in Pembroke, Georgia. The tornado tracked eastward for approximately 30 miles, causing catastrophic damage in the cities of Ellabell and Black Creek. The tornado reached maximum winds of 170 mph, making it one of the strongest tornadoes of the year.\n\n# Non-tornadic impacts\n\nIn addition to the significant tornadoes, the outbreak produced numerous non-tornadic impacts, including large hail, damaging winds, and flash flooding. The most significant non-tornadic impact occurred in Alabama, where a derecho produced winds of up to 80 mph, causing widespread power outages.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe tornado outbreak sequence of April 4–7, 2022, resulted in significant damage and loss of life across the southeastern United States. A total of 12 fatalities were reported, with numerous injuries and widespread destruction. The outbreak also caused significant disruptions to daily life, with thousands of people left without power or access to basic necessities.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of tornado outbreaks\n* Tornado outbreak sequence of April 2022\n* 2022 tornado season\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a summary of the tornado outbreak sequence of April 4–7, 2022.

{"title": "Malahai", "content": "#Etymology\n#Design and materials\n#In Russia\n#See also\n#Explanatory notes\n", "lang": "en", "article": "# Malahai\n\nMalahai is a type of traditional Russian wooden spoon that has been used for centuries in various aspects of Russian life, from cooking and serving food to ceremonial and cultural practices. The malahai is an integral part of Russian heritage and continues to be an important symbol of Russian culture.\n\n# Etymology\n\nThe origin of the word \"malahai\" is unclear, but it is believed to have come from the Russian word \"maly\" meaning \"small\" or \"minor\". Another theory suggests that the term \"malahai\" may be derived from the Russian word \"malovat'\" meaning \"to stir\" or \"to mix\", which refers to the primary function of the spoon.\n\n# Design and materials\n\n## Traditional design\n\nThe traditional malahai is a long-handled, shallow-bowled wooden spoon with a flat, broad blade. The handle is typically made from a single piece of wood, often birch or beech, and is straight or slightly curved. The bowl of the spoon is shallow and wide, with a rounded or flat edge. The malahai is designed for scooping, stirring, and serving a variety of foods, including soups, stews, and cereals.\n\n## Materials\n\nMalahais are typically made from wood, with birch and beech being the most common types used. The wood is often hand-carved and finished with a natural oil or wax to protect the surface and enhance the grain. Some malahais may also be decorated with intricate carvings or inlays, adding to their aesthetic value.\n\n## Variations\n\nOver time, variations of the malahai have emerged, with different regions in Russia developing their own unique designs and styles. For example, the malahai used in the northern regions of Russia is often longer and more slender, with a smaller bowl, while the malahai used in the southern regions is often shorter and more robust, with a larger bowl.\n\n# In Russia\n\n## Traditional uses\n\nThe malahai has played a significant role in Russian cuisine and culture for centuries. It is used for a variety of tasks, including stirring and serving soups, stews, and cereals, as well as for cooking and serving traditional Russian dishes such as borscht and pelmeni.\n\n## Ceremonial uses\n\nThe malahai has also been used in various ceremonial and cultural practices in Russia. For example, the malahai is often used in traditional Russian wedding ceremonies, where it is used to serve a special sweet bread called \"korovai\" to the bride and groom. The malahai is also used in traditional Russian funeral ceremonies, where it is used to sprinkle holy water over the deceased.\n\n## Modern uses\n\nIn modern times, the malahai has become a popular souvenir and decorative item, with many Russians proudly displaying malahais in their homes as a symbol of their cultural heritage. The malahai has also become a popular tool for outdoor enthusiasts, who use it for camping and cooking in the wilderness.\n\n# See also\n\n* Russian cuisine\n* Russian culture\n* Wooden spoon\n* Traditional Russian wedding\n* Traditional Russian funeral\n\n# Explanatory notes\n\nThis article provides an overview of the malahai, a traditional Russian wooden spoon that has played a significant role in Russian cuisine and culture for centuries.

The republic was established after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and its existence was marked by tensions with Ukraine, which considered Crimea to be part of its territory.\n\n## Crimean ASSR\n\nThe Crimean Peninsula had been a part of the Russian Empire since the late 18th century, and after the Russian Revolution, it became an autonomous republic within the Soviet Union, known as the Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (ASSR). During World War II, the peninsula was occupied by Nazi Germany, and after the war, the Soviet government forcibly deported the indigenous Crimean Tatar population, accusing them of collaborating with the Germans. The Crimean ASSR was then abolished, and the peninsula was incorporated into the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic.\n\n## Name change in 1992\n\nIn the late 1980s, the Soviet Union began to experience significant political and economic changes, which ultimately led to its dissolution in 1991. In the aftermath of the Soviet collapse, the Crimean Peninsula became part of Ukraine, which declared its independence on August 24, 1991. However, the majority of the population on the peninsula, which was predominantly ethnic Russian, felt a strong affinity with Russia and began to demand greater autonomy or even independence.\n\nOn May 5, 1992, the Crimean Parliament declared the establishment of the Republic of Crimea, which was a move that was not recognized by Ukraine or the international community. The new republic adopted its own constitution, which declared Crimea to be a sovereign state with its own government, economy, and military.\n\n## Relations with Ukraine\n\nThe establishment of the Republic of Crimea created significant tensions with Ukraine, which considered the peninsula to be part of its territory. The Ukrainian government saw the declaration of independence as a challenge to its authority and began to take steps to assert its control over Crimea.\n\nIn June 1992, Ukraine's President Leonid Kravchuk and Russia's President Boris Yeltsin signed an agreement in which Russia recognized Ukraine's sovereignty over Crimea. However, the agreement also acknowledged Crimea's right to self-determination and autonomy, which created a degree of ambiguity and continued to fuel tensions between Ukraine and Russia.\n\n## Relations with Russia\n\nWhile Russia officially recognized Ukraine's sovereignty over Crimea, many Russians saw the peninsula as part of their own country's territory. The Russian government provided significant economic and military aid to Crimea, which helped to fuel the peninsula's separatist movement.\n\nIn 1993, Russia and Ukraine signed a treaty that established a Russian naval base in Sevastopol, which is a major port city on the Crimean Peninsula. The treaty gave Russia a significant degree of control over the base and its surrounding territory, which further complicated the relationship between Ukraine and Crimea.\n\n## Name change in 1995\n\nIn March 1995, Ukraine's President Leonid Kuchma signed a decree that abolished the Crimean Republic and established the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, which was a part of Ukraine. The decree was part of a broader effort to assert Ukraine's control over the peninsula and to reduce tensions with Russia.\n\nThe establishment of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea was a compromise that gave the peninsula a significant degree of autonomy while also acknowledging Ukraine's sovereignty. The new republic adopted its own constitution, which declared Crimea to be a part of Ukraine while also recognizing its right to self-determination and autonomy.\n\n## See also\n\n* Crimean Peninsula\n* History of Crimea\n* Ukraine–Russia relations\n* Autonomous Republic of Crimea\n\n## Notes\n\nThe Republic of Crimea was a short-lived and internationally unrecognized state that existed from 1992 to 1995 on the Crimean Peninsula.\n\n## References\n\nThis article does not include any citations or references.\n\n## Sources\n\nThis article does not include any sources.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Republic_of_Crimea_(1992–1995)\" following this outline:\n\n#Crimean ASSR\n#Name change in 1992\n#Relations with Ukraine\n#Relations with Russia\n#Name change in 1995\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Sources\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The film is based on the true story of Tim Ballard, a former CIA operative who founded Operation Underground Railroad, a non-profit organization dedicated to rescuing victims of human trafficking.\n\n#Plot\n\nThe film follows Tim Ballard (played by Jim Caviezel), a former CIA operative who becomes disillusioned with the agency's bureaucracy and decides to leave to start his own organization, Operation Underground Railroad. Ballard's goal is to rescue victims of human trafficking, particularly children, from the clutches of their captors. He assembles a team of experts, including his wife Katherine (played by Mira Sorvino) and a former Navy SEAL, and together they embark on a series of perilous missions to rescue victims and bring their captors to justice.\n\nAs Ballard delves deeper into the world of human trafficking, he faces numerous challenges, including resistance from law enforcement and government agencies, as well as the ever-present threat of violence from the traffickers themselves. Despite these obstacles, Ballard remains resolute in his mission, driven by his faith and his determination to protect the innocent.\n\n#Cast\n\n* Jim Caviezel as Tim Ballard\n* Mira Sorvino as Katherine Ballard\n* Bill Camp as Tom\n* Eduardo Verástegui as Paul\n* José Zúñiga as Javier\n* Kurt Fuller as Senator\n* Gary Basaraba as Detective\n\n#Production\n\n##Development\n\nThe film was developed by Alejandro Monteverde and Rodney Comrie, who were inspired by the true story of Tim Ballard and Operation Underground Railroad. Monteverde, who also directed the film, was drawn to the project because of its themes of faith, family, and redemption. The script was written in collaboration with Ballard, who served as a consultant on the film.\n\n##Filming\n\nPrincipal photography took place in 2018 in various locations, including Mexico, Utah, and Washington, D.C. The film was shot on a relatively modest budget, but the filmmakers were able to secure the cooperation of several government agencies, including the U.S. Marshals Service, which provided access to real-life law enforcement equipment and personnel.\n\n##Distribution\n\nThe film was distributed by Angel Studios, a faith-based production company that specializes in creating content for Christian audiences. The company partnered with Fathom Events to release the film in theaters across the United States, with a focus on faith-based communities.\n\n##Accuracy\n\nThe film has been praised for its accuracy in depicting the work of Operation Underground Railroad and the challenges faced by human trafficking victims. Ballard himself has endorsed the film, stating that it accurately captures the spirit of his organization's mission.\n\n#Connections to QAnon conspiracy theories\n\nSound of Freedom has been linked to QAnon conspiracy theories, which claim that a secret cabal of elites is engaged in a massive human trafficking operation. Some QAnon adherents have pointed to the film as evidence of this conspiracy, and Ballard has been accused of being a \"QAnon hero.\" However, Ballard has repeatedly denied any connection to QAnon, and the film's producers have stated that they do not endorse or support the conspiracy theory.\n\n#Pay-it-forward scheme\n\nThe film's producers launched a pay-it-forward scheme, in which viewers were encouraged to purchase tickets for others who might not be able to afford them. The scheme was designed to promote community engagement and to raise awareness about human trafficking.\n\n#Reception\n\n##Critical response\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising its powerful storyline and strong performances, while others criticized its heavy-handed approach to faith and its perceived connections to QAnon conspiracy theories. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 40% approval rating, based on 12 reviews.\n\n##Box office\n\nDespite mixed reviews, the film performed well at the box office, grossing over $1 million in its opening weekend. The film's success was driven in part by its faith-based appeal, with many Christian audiences supporting the film.\n\n##Audience reception and faith-based appeal\n\nThe film has been praised by many Christian audiences for its positive portrayal of faith and its emphasis on the importance of family and redemption. The film's faith-based themes have been seen as a major draw for audiences, with many viewers praising the film's uplifting message.\n\n##Endorsements and special screening\n\nThe film has been endorsed by several high-profile figures, including Tim Ballard himself, as well as other anti-human trafficking advocates. The film has also been screened at several special events, including a screening at the U.S. Capitol, where it was attended by lawmakers and other dignitaries.\n\n##Accolades\n\nThe film has received several awards and nominations, including a nomination for Best Faith-Based Film at the 2020 Movieguide Awards.\n\n#References\n\n#External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Sound_of_Freedom_(film)\" following this outline:\n\n#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production\n##Development\n##Filming\n##Distribution\n##Accuracy\n#Connections to QAnon conspiracy theories\n#Pay-it-forward scheme\n#Reception\n##Critical response\n##Box office\n##Audience reception and faith-based appeal\n##Endorsements and special screening\n##Accolades\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The outbreak has since spread to multiple countries and territories, with a significant increase in cases reported outside of Africa, where the virus is endemic.\n\n# Background\n\n## Emergency preparedness prior to outbreak\n\nPrior to the outbreak, the World Health Organization (WHO) had been monitoring the mpox virus, which is a zoonotic disease that can be transmitted from animals to humans. In 2018, the WHO had identified mpox as a priority disease for research and development, and had been working with countries to strengthen their preparedness and response capacities.\n\n## Endemic mpox in Africa\n\nMpox is endemic in several countries in Central and West Africa, where it is typically spread through contact with infected animals or contaminated materials. The virus is usually mild, with symptoms including fever, headache, and rash. However, in rare cases, mpox can cause severe illness and death.\n\n# Outbreak characteristics\n\n## Phylogenetics\n\nPhylogenetic analysis of the mpox virus has revealed that the outbreak is caused by a strain of the virus that is closely related to the strain that is endemic in Africa. However, the virus has undergone significant mutations, which may have contributed to its increased transmissibility.\n\n## Long incubation periods\n\nOne of the distinctive features of the 2022–2023 mpox outbreak is the long incubation period of the virus, which can range from a few days to several weeks. This has made it challenging for health authorities to track the spread of the disease and identify contacts.\n\n## Mild clinical manifestations\n\nThe clinical manifestations of mpox during the outbreak have been generally mild, with most cases presenting with fever, headache, and rash. However, some cases have reported more severe symptoms, including respiratory distress and hemorrhagic manifestations.\n\n## Fear of zoonotic spread\n\nThere is ongoing concern about the potential for zoonotic spread of the mpox virus, particularly in countries with large animal populations. While the risk of zoonotic transmission is considered low, health authorities are taking precautions to monitor animal populations and prevent potential transmission.\n\n# Chronology\n\n## Deaths outside of Africa\n\nThe first deaths outside of Africa were reported in June 2022, in the United Kingdom and Spain. Since then, there have been reports of deaths in several other countries, including the United States, Brazil, and India.\n\n# Transmission\n\n## Transmission patterns\n\nThe transmission patterns of the mpox virus during the outbreak have been characterized by person-to-person contact, primarily through close contact with an infected person. However, there is also evidence of transmission through contaminated materials, such as bedding and clothing.\n\n## Wastewater surveillance\n\nWastewater surveillance has been used to monitor the spread of the mpox virus in several countries. This has allowed health authorities to track the virus in real-time and identify areas where the virus is circulating.\n\n# Interventions\n\n## Testing and containment\n\nHealth authorities have implemented testing and containment measures to slow the spread of the virus. This has included contact tracing, testing of suspected cases, and isolation of confirmed cases.\n\n## Vaccination\n\nVaccination efforts have been underway in several countries, using vaccines that are approved for use against smallpox. While these vaccines are not specifically licensed for use against mpox, they are considered to be effective in preventing severe illness.\n\n# Social aspects\n\n## Misinformation\n\nThere has been significant misinformation about the mpox virus and the outbreak, particularly on social media. This has led to confusion and fear among the public, and has made it challenging for health authorities to communicate accurate information.\n\n# Responses\n\n## World Health Organization\n\nThe WHO has played a key role in responding to the outbreak, providing technical assistance and support to countries affected by the virus. The WHO has also worked to coordinate the global response, including the development of guidelines and recommendations for prevention and control.\n\n## Countries\n\nCountries affected by the outbreak have implemented a range of measures to control the spread of the virus, including testing and containment, vaccination, and public health education.\n\n## Dependent territories\n\nDependent territories, such as Puerto Rico and Guam, have also been affected by the outbreak. These territories have received support from their parent countries, as well as from the WHO.\n\n# Cases per country and territory\n\n## Timeline of first confirmed cases by country or territory\n\n* United Kingdom: May 6, 2022\n* Spain: May 20, 2022\n* United States: May 22, 2022\n* Canada: May 26, 2022\n* Brazil: June 8, 2022\n* India: June 23, 2022\n* Other countries: see below\n\n## Timeline of suspected cases by country or territory\n\n* Note: Suspected cases are not included in the official case count, but are reported by health authorities as part of their surveillance efforts.\n\n## Timeline of first deaths by country or territory (in countries with initial 2022 detection from 6 May onwards)\n\n* United Kingdom: June 14, 2022\n* Spain: June 17, 2022\n* United States: July 1, 2022\n* Brazil: July 21, 2022\n* India: August 1, 2022\n* Other countries: see below\n\n# See also\n\n* Mpox\n* Smallpox\n* Zoonotic diseases\n* Global health emergencies\n\n# References\n\n* Note: References are not included in this article, but can be found in the original sources.\n\n# External links\n\n* World Health Organization: Mpox\n* Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Mpox", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022–2023_mpox_outbreak\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Emergency preparedness prior to outbreak\n##Endemic mpox in Africa\n#Outbreak characteristics\n##Phylogenetics\n##Long incubation periods\n##Mild clinical manifestations\n##Fear of zoonotic spread\n#Chronology\n##Deaths outside of Africa\n#Transmission\n##Transmission patterns\n##Wastewater surveillance\n#Interventions\n##Testing and containment\n##Vaccination\n#Social aspects\n##Misinformation\n#Responses\n##World Health Organization\n##Countries\n##Dependent territories\n#Cases per country and territory\n##Timeline of first confirmed cases by country or territory\n##Timeline of suspected cases by country or territory\n##Timeline of first deaths by country or territory (in countries with initial 2022 detection from 6 May onwards)\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He is considered one of the greatest mathematicians of all time, and his work had a profound impact on the development of modern mathematics and science.\n\n# Biography\n\n## Youth and education\n\nGauss was born in Braunschweig, in the Duchy of Brunswick (now part of Lower Saxony, Germany), to a poor family. His father, Gebhard Dietrich Gauss, was a gardener and a bricklayer, and his mother, Dorothea Benze, was a housemaid. Gauss's exceptional mathematical talents were recognized from an early age. At the age of three, he corrected his father's arithmetic calculations, and by the age of seven, he was performing complex calculations in his head.\n\nGauss attended the local elementary school and later the Martino-Katharineum, a secondary school in Braunschweig. In 1792, he entered the University of Göttingen, where he studied mathematics, physics, and philosophy. Gauss's academic career was marked by his exceptional mathematical abilities, and he quickly became known for his innovative solutions to mathematical problems.\n\n## Private scholar\n\nAfter completing his studies, Gauss returned to Braunschweig and lived as a private scholar, supported by his patron, the Duke of Brunswick. During this period, he worked on his famous book, \"Disquisitiones Arithmeticae,\" which was published in 1801. This book laid the foundations for modern number theory and established Gauss as a leading mathematician of his time.\n\n## Professor in Göttingen\n\nIn 1807, Gauss was appointed as the director of the astronomical observatory in Göttingen, a position he held until his death. He also became a professor of mathematics at the University of Göttingen, where he taught mathematics and astronomy. Gauss's lectures were highly regarded, and he attracted many students from all over Europe.\n\n## Gauss's brain\n\nAfter Gauss's death, his brain was preserved and studied by the German anatomist Rudolf Wagner. Wagner's study revealed that Gauss's brain had some unusual features, including a higher-than-average number of neurons and a more developed cerebral cortex. These findings have been interpreted as evidence of Gauss's exceptional cognitive abilities.\n\n## Family\n\nGauss married Johanna Osthoff in 1805, and they had two sons, Joseph and Wilhelm. After Johanna's death in 1809, Gauss married Minna Waldeck in 1810, and they had three children together. Gauss's family life was marked by tragedy, including the death of his first wife and the loss of several children.\n\n## Personality\n\nGauss was known for his exceptional intelligence, his passion for mathematics, and his perfectionism.

It is the country's primary football competition, and it is contested by 18 clubs. The league is operated by the Football Association of Indonesia (PSSI) and is currently sponsored by Shopee.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\n### Origins\n\nThe concept of a top-flight football league in Indonesia dates back to the 1930s, when the country was still a Dutch colony. The first national football competition, the Perserikatan, was established in 1930. However, this competition was not a professional league, and it was mainly contested by amateur teams.\n\n### Foundation\n\nIn 1979, the PSSI introduced the Galatama, a semi-professional league that was the precursor to the modern-day Liga 1. The Galatama was contested by teams from various regions in Indonesia, and it was the first national football competition to feature teams from outside Java.\n\n### Dualism\n\nIn 1990, the PSSI introduced the Liga Indonesia, which was the country's first professional football league. However, the Liga Indonesia was not the only top-flight competition in Indonesia at that time. The Perserikatan, which was still contested by amateur teams, continued to exist alongside the Liga Indonesia. This led to a period of dualism in Indonesian football, with two separate competitions running concurrently.\n\n### Government intervention and FIFA suspension\n\nIn 2015, the Indonesian government intervened in the country's football affairs, leading to a crisis that resulted in the suspension of the PSSI by FIFA. The government's intervention led to the establishment of a rival league, the Indonesia Super League (ISL), which was not recognized by FIFA. The ISL was eventually disbanded, and the PSSI was reinstated by FIFA in 2016.\n\n### Name change\n\nIn 2017, the PSSI announced that the top-flight league would be rebranded as Liga 1, replacing the Indonesia Super League (ISL) name. The name change was intended to signal a new era in Indonesian football, with a focus on improving the league's competitiveness and professionalism.\n\nCompetition format\n-----------------\n\n### Competition\n\nLiga 1 is contested by 18 teams, with each team playing the others twice (home and away) during the regular season. The team with the most points at the end of the regular season is crowned the champion.\n\n### Promotion and relegation\n\nThe bottom three teams in Liga 1 are relegated to Liga 2, the country's second-tier competition. The top three teams in Liga 2 are promoted to Liga 1 for the following season.\n\n### Video assistant referee\n\nLiga 1 introduced the video assistant referee (VAR) system in 2020, becoming the first league in Southeast Asia to do so. The VAR system is used to assist referees in making decisions on goals, penalties, and direct red cards.\n\nClubs\n------\n\n### Champions\n\nThe following teams have won the Liga 1 title:\n\n* Persib Bandung (2014)\n* Persipura Jayapura (2015)\n* Persipura Jayapura (2016)\n* Bali United (2017)\n* Persija Jakarta (2018)\n* Bali United (2019)\n* Persib Bandung (2020)\n* Bali United (2021)\n* Bali United (2022)\n\n### Performance by clubs\n\nThe following table shows the performance of Liga 1 clubs in the competition:\n\n| Team | Titles | Runners-up | Third place |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Bali United | 4 | 1 | 1 |\n| Persipura Jayapura | 2 | 2 | 1 |\n| Persib Bandung | 2 | 1 | 2 |\n| Persija Jakarta | 1 | 2 | 1 |\n\n### 2024–25 season\n\nThe 2024–25 Liga 1 season will feature the following teams:\n\n* Arema FC\n* Bali United\n* Barito Putera\n* Bhayangkara FC\n* Dewa United\n* Madura United\n* Mitra Kukar\n* Persib Bandung\n* Persija Jakarta\n* Persipura Jayapura\n* Persita Tangerang\n* PSM Makassar\n* PS TNI\n* Semen Padang\n* Sriwijaya FC\n* Tira Persikabo\n* Trunojoyo FC\n\n### Maps\n\nA map showing the locations of Liga 1 teams can be found below:\n\n[Insert map]\n\n### Former clubs\n\nThe following teams have played in Liga 1 but are no longer in the competition:\n\n* Persebaya Surabaya (relegated to Liga 2)\n* Persela Lamongan (relegated to Liga 2)\n* Perseru Serui (relegated to Liga 2)\n* PSIS Semarang (relegated to Liga 2)\n\n### All-time Liga 1 table\n\nThe following table shows the all-time Liga 1 table:\n\n| Team | Seasons | Matches | Wins | Draws | Losses | Goals for | Goals against | Points |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Bali United | 8 | 192 | 93 | 44 | 55 | 334 | 242 | 323 |\n| Persipura Jayapura | 8 | 192 | 90 | 43 | 59 | 323 | 245 | 313 |\n| Persib Bandung | 8 | 192 | 83 | 52 | 57 | 293 | 246 | 301 |\n| Persija Jakarta | 8 | 192 | 78 | 52 | 62 | 283 | 257 | 286 |\n\nForeign players\n---------------\n\nLiga 1 allows each team to have a maximum of four foreign players in their squad.

This case is one of several investigations and prosecutions involving Trump since his presidency. The case involves the unauthorized retention and concealment of classified documents at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, and the alleged obstruction of justice in the investigation that followed.\n\n# Background\n\nIn January 2021, as Trump's presidency came to an end, the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) requested the return of presidential records from Trump's administration. In response, Trump returned 15 boxes of documents to NARA in January 2022. However, the agency later discovered that some of the documents were classified, and a subsequent review revealed that additional classified documents were still in Trump's possession.\n\nIn April 2022, the Department of Justice (DOJ) issued a subpoena to Trump for the return of all remaining classified documents. Trump's lawyers claimed that all documents had been returned, but in June 2022, the FBI executed a search warrant at Mar-a-Lago, recovering additional classified documents. The search warrant was obtained after the DOJ had evidence that Trump's lawyers had not been truthful about the existence of classified documents.\n\n# Indictments and Arraignments\n\n## Original Indictment\n\nOn June 8, 2023, a federal grand jury indicted Trump on 32 counts related to the mishandling of classified documents. The indictment alleged that Trump had willfully retained and concealed classified documents, and that he had obstructed justice by making false statements to investigators and attempting to intimidate witnesses.\n\n## Superseding Indictment\n\nOn August 1, 2023, a superseding indictment was filed, adding 7 new counts to the original indictment. The superseding indictment included new allegations of obstruction of justice, including Trump's alleged attempts to influence the testimony of a witness.\n\n## Assignment of District Judge\n\nThe case was assigned to District Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee. Judge Cannon's appointment to the case was met with criticism from some, who argued that her appointment by Trump created a conflict of interest.\n\n## Arraignments\n\n### Trump\n\nTrump was arraigned on June 13, 2023, at the federal courthouse in Miami, Florida. During the arraignment, Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges.\n\n### Nauta\n\nWaltine Nauta, a Trump aide, was also arraigned on June 13, 2023. Nauta was charged with conspiracy to obstruct justice and making false statements to investigators.\n\n### De Oliveira\n\nCarlos De Oliveira, a Trump employee, was arraigned on June 15, 2023. De Oliveira was charged with conspiracy to obstruct justice and making false statements to investigators.\n\n# Pretrial Proceedings\n\n## 2023\n\nIn the months following the indictment, the parties engaged in pretrial proceedings, including motions and discovery. Trump's lawyers filed several motions, including a motion to dismiss the indictment and a motion to delay the trial.\n\n## 2024\n\nIn January 2024, Trump's lawyers filed a motion to indefinitely delay the trial, citing the upcoming presidential election. The motion argued that the trial would interfere with Trump's ability to campaign and would create an unfair advantage for his opponents.\n\n### Trump's Request to Indefinitely Delay Trial\n\nThe motion to delay the trial was met with opposition from the DOJ, which argued that the trial should proceed as scheduled. The DOJ argued that Trump's request was an attempt to use the trial as a political issue, and that the trial should not be delayed simply because of the upcoming election.\n\n# Dismissal and Appeal\n\nOn February 10, 2024, Judge Cannon granted Trump's motion to dismiss the indictment. The dismissal was met with widespread criticism, with many arguing that the dismissal was a miscarriage of justice.\n\nThe DOJ appealed the dismissal to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. The appeal argued that Judge Cannon had erred in dismissing the indictment, and that the trial should proceed as scheduled.\n\n# Response\n\n## To Indictment\n\n### Trump\n\nTrump responded to the indictment by denying all allegations and attacking the DOJ and the FBI. Trump claimed that the indictment was a \"witch hunt\" and that he was being persecuted for political reasons.\n\n### Other Republicans\n\nMany Republicans came to Trump's defense, attacking the DOJ and the FBI for what they saw as a partisan prosecution. Some Republicans argued that the indictment was an attempt to interfere with the 2024 presidential election.\n\n### Democrats\n\nDemocrats responded to the indictment by calling for Trump to be held accountable for his actions. Many Democrats argued that the indictment was a necessary step in ensuring that Trump was held accountable for his alleged crimes.\n\n## To Dismissal\n\nThe dismissal of the indictment was met with widespread criticism from Democrats and many legal experts. Many argued that the dismissal was a miscarriage of justice, and that Trump had been given special treatment because of his status as a former president.\n\n# See Also\n\n* Investigations involving Donald Trump\n* Federal prosecution of Donald Trump (2020 election case)\n\n# References\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)\n\n# External Links\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Federal_prosecution_of_Donald_Trump_(classified_documents_case)\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Indictments and arraignments\n##Original indictment\n##Superseding indictment\n##Assignment of district judge\n##Arraignments\n###Trump\n###Nauta\n###De Oliveira\n#Pretrial proceedings\n##2023\n##2024\n###Trump's request to indefinitely delay trial\n#Dismissal and appeal\n#Response\n##To indictment\n###Trump\n###Other Republicans\n###Democrats\n##To dismissal\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This approach to game development has gained popularity over the years, with many successful games being released under open-source licenses.\n\nDefinition and differentiation\n-----------------------------\n\nOpen-source video games are often confused with freeware games, which are games that are available for free but do not provide access to their source code. Open-source games, on the other hand, provide the source code, allowing users to modify and customize the game to their liking. This differentiation is important, as it highlights the unique aspect of open-source games.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nThe concept of open-source software has been around for decades, with the first open-source licenses being developed in the 1980s. However, it wasn't until the 1990s that open-source software started to gain popularity, with the release of the Linux operating system. The success of Linux paved the way for other open-source projects, including video games.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### Beginnings and early games\n\nThe first open-source video games were simple text-based games, such as adventure games and interactive fiction. These games were often created by hobbyists and shared on online communities, such as bulletin board systems (BBSs) and online forums. One of the earliest open-source games is the 1970s game \"Colossal Cave Adventure,\" which was later released under an open-source license.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, open-source games started to become more complex, with the release of games such as \"NetHack\" and \"ADOM.\" These games were still text-based but featured more advanced gameplay mechanics and storytelling.\n\n### 3D games and source releases\n\nThe 1990s saw the release of the first 3D open-source games, such as \"Quake\" and \"Doom.\" These games were initially released as proprietary software but were later released under open-source licenses. The source code for these games allowed developers to create custom levels, models, and game modes.\n\nThe release of 3D game engines such as \"id Tech 3\" and \"Doom 3\" further accelerated the development of open-source games. These engines provided a foundation for developers to create their own 3D games, and many open-source games were built using these engines.\n\n### Rise in popularity and diversity\n\nIn the 2000s, open-source games started to gain more popularity, with the release of games such as \"World of Goo\" and \"Braid.\" These games were critically acclaimed and commercially successful, demonstrating that open-source games could be both fun and profitable.\n\nThe rise of digital distribution platforms such as Steam and GOG.com also made it easier for open-source games to reach a wider audience. Many open-source games were released on these platforms, and some even became best-sellers.\n\n### Greater organization\n\nAs the open-source game community grew, there was a need for greater organization and coordination. This led to the formation of organizations such as the Open Source Game Alliance (OSGA) and the Free Software Foundation (FSF).\n\nThese organizations provided resources and support for open-source game developers, including documentation, tutorials, and community forums. They also helped to promote open-source games and advocate for the benefits of open-source game development.\n\n### Hubs and development teams\n\nThe open-source game community has also given rise to hubs and development teams. These teams are often formed around a specific game or game engine and provide a way for developers to collaborate and share resources.\n\nExamples of open-source game hubs include the \"Unreal Engine\" community and the \"Godot Engine\" community. These communities provide a wealth of resources, including tutorials, documentation, and community forums.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Open-source software\n* Free and open-source software\n* List of open-source video games\n* Open-source game engine\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nExternal links\n--------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Open-source_video_game\" following this outline:\n\n#Definition and differentiation\n#Background\n#History\n##Beginnings and early games\n##3D games and source releases\n##Rise in popularity and diversity\n##Greater organization\n##Hubs and development teams\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The storm brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to several countries in the Caribbean, particularly Cuba, Florida, and the Bahamas. In this article, we will provide an overview of the meteorological history of Tropical Storm Alex, its impact on the affected areas, and the preparations made to mitigate its effects.\n\n# Meteorological history\n\nTropical Storm Alex formed on June 2, 2022, as a tropical disturbance in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico. The system slowly organized over the next few days, with a low-pressure area developing on June 4. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring the system on June 3, and by June 5, it had strengthened into a tropical depression. The depression gradually intensified, and on June 6, it became a tropical storm, earning the name Alex.\n\nAlex moved north-northeastward, influenced by a mid-level trough over the eastern United States. The storm's maximum sustained winds increased to 65 mph (105 km/h) on June 7, and it began to exhibit characteristics of a subtropical cyclone. Alex's center passed over the western part of Cuba on June 8, bringing heavy rainfall and strong winds to the island.\n\nAfter crossing Cuba, Alex moved into the Atlantic Ocean, where it encountered a more favorable environment for intensification. The storm's winds increased to 70 mph (115 km/h) on June 9, and it began to take on a more tropical appearance. However, Alex's intensification was short-lived, as it encountered increasing wind shear and dry air on June 10. The storm's winds gradually decreased, and it became a post-tropical cyclone on June 11.\n\n# Preparations and impact\n\nTropical Storm Alex brought significant impacts to several countries in the Caribbean, particularly Cuba, Florida, and the Bahamas. In this section, we will provide an overview of the preparations made and the effects of the storm on these areas.\n\n## Cuba\n\nCuba was the first country to be affected by Tropical Storm Alex. The storm's center passed over the western part of the island on June 8, bringing heavy rainfall and strong winds. The Cuban Meteorological Institute reported that the storm's maximum sustained winds reached 65 mph (105 km/h) in some areas, causing significant damage to buildings and infrastructure.\n\nThe Cuban government took extensive precautions to prepare for the storm, including evacuating over 50,000 people from low-lying areas and coastal regions. The government also closed schools, airports, and seaports, and suspended all outdoor activities.\n\nDespite these preparations, the storm still caused significant damage to the island. The Cuban government reported that over 1,000 homes were damaged or destroyed, and several roads and bridges were affected. The storm also caused widespread power outages, leaving thousands of people without electricity.\n\n## Florida\n\nTropical Storm Alex brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to southern Florida, particularly the Florida Keys. The storm's outer rain bands reached the state on June 9, causing flooding and power outages in some areas.\n\nThe National Weather Service issued a tropical storm watch for the Florida Keys and a flood watch for several counties in southern Florida. The Florida Emergency Management Division activated its emergency operations center to coordinate the state's response to the storm.\n\nDespite the storm's impacts, no major damage or casualties were reported in Florida. The state's emergency management officials praised the public's preparedness and response to the storm, noting that many residents had taken precautions to secure their homes and property.\n\n## The Bahamas\n\nTropical Storm Alex brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to the Bahamas, particularly the southern islands. The storm's center passed over the islands on June 10, causing significant flooding and damage to buildings and infrastructure.\n\nThe Bahamian government issued a tropical storm warning for the southern islands and a flood warning for several areas. The government also closed schools and airports, and suspended all outdoor activities.\n\nDespite these precautions, the storm still caused significant damage to the islands. The Bahamian government reported that over 100 homes were damaged or destroyed, and several roads and bridges were affected. The storm also caused widespread power outages, leaving thousands of people without electricity.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of tropical cyclones\n* List of tropical storms\n* Tropical cyclone\n* Hurricane\n* Tropical depression\n* Subtropical cyclone\n* Post-tropical cyclone\n\n# References\n\n*Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements.\n\n# External links\n\n* National Hurricane Center\n* National Weather Service\n* Cuban Meteorological Institute\n* Florida Emergency Management Division\n* Bahamian Government Website", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Tropical_Storm_Alex_(2022)\" following this outline:\n\n#Meteorological history\n#Preparations and impact\n##Cuba\n##Florida\n##The Bahamas\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The election was called after the dissolution of the Parliament by President Sergio Mattarella, following the collapse of the Draghi government.\n\n#Background\n\nThe 2022 Italian general election was the first national election to be held in Italy since the COVID-19 pandemic. The previous election, held in 2018, resulted in a hung parliament, with no party or coalition able to form a government. After several months of negotiations, a coalition government was formed between the Five Star Movement (M5S) and the League, led by Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. However, the government collapsed in August 2022, after a vote of no confidence was passed by the Senate.\n\n#Electoral Campaign\n\nThe electoral campaign for the 2022 Italian general election was marked by several key issues, including the economy, immigration, and the European Union. The main parties and coalitions presented their programs and candidates, and several electoral debates were held.\n\n##Main Parties' Slogans\n\n* Brothers of Italy: \"Italy First\"\n* Democratic Party: \"For a New Italy\"\n* Five Star Movement: \"We Are the Change\"\n* Forza Italia: \"With Berlusconi, Italy Will Rise Again\"\n* League: \"We Will Make Italy Great Again\"\n* Action: \"A New Generation for Italy\"\n* Italia Viva: \"Italy Will Live\"\n\n##Electoral Debates\n\nSeveral electoral debates were held during the campaign, featuring the leaders of the main parties and coalitions. The debates were broadcast on television and online, and were widely followed by the public.\n\n#Electoral System\n\nThe Italian electoral system is a mixed system, combining elements of proportional representation and first-past-the-post (FPTP). The Chamber of Deputies is elected using a proportional system, with 37% of the seats allocated to the winning party or coalition, and the remaining seats allocated to the other parties and coalitions in proportion to their vote share. The Senate is elected using a mixed system, with 74% of the seats allocated using FPTP, and the remaining seats allocated using proportional representation.\n\n#Electoral Lists\n\nThe electoral lists for the 2022 Italian general election were presented by the parties and coalitions in August 2022. The lists included the candidates for the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, as well as the leaders of the parties and coalitions.\n\n##Lists with Parliamentary Representation\n\n* Brothers of Italy\n* Democratic Party\n* Five Star Movement\n* Forza Italia\n* League\n* Action\n* Italia Viva\n\n##Lists without Parliamentary Representation\n\n* Animalist Party\n* Communist Party\n* Italian Radicals\n* South Tyrolean Freedom\n* Union of the Centre\n\n##Lists Running Only in Overseas Constituencies\n\n* Associative Movement Italians Abroad\n* Italians Abroad\n* Movement of Italians Abroad\n\n#Opinion Polls\n\nThe opinion polls for the 2022 Italian general election were published regularly during the campaign, and showed a consistent lead for the centre-right coalition, led by Brothers of Italy.
