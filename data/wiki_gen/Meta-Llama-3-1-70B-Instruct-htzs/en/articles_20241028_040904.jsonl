From the earliest prehistoric inhabitants to the present day, Taiwan has been influenced by various cultures, empires, and colonial powers. This article provides an overview of the major periods and events in Taiwan's history, highlighting the key developments, figures, and themes that have shaped the island's past.\n\n#Prehistory\n\nThe earliest known human habitation in Taiwan dates back to the Paleolithic era, around 50,000 years ago. Archaeological evidence suggests that the island was initially inhabited by indigenous tribes, including the Amis, Atayal, Bunun, Kanakanavu, Kavalan, Paiwan, Puyuma, Rukai, Saisiyat, Tao, and Truku. These groups developed complex societies, with their own languages, cultures, and traditions. The indigenous people of Taiwan lived in relative isolation until the arrival of external influences.\n\n#Chinese contact and settlement\n\nThe first recorded Chinese contact with Taiwan occurred in the 13th century, when the Southern Song dynasty (1127-1279) sent expeditions to the island. However, it was not until the 16th century that Chinese settlement began in earnest. In 1590, the Ming dynasty (1368-1644) established a formal administration in Taiwan, and Chinese immigrants started to arrive in larger numbers. The early Chinese settlers were primarily from the provinces of Fujian and Guangdong, and they brought with them their languages, customs, and agricultural practices.\n\n#Dutch and Spanish colonies (1624–1668)\n\n##Contact and establishment\n\nIn 1624, the Dutch East India Company (VOC) established a trading post in Taiwan, which became the first European settlement on the island. The Dutch were attracted by Taiwan's strategic location and natural resources, particularly its timber and sulfur deposits. The VOC's presence in Taiwan marked the beginning of European colonialism in East Asia.\n\n##Piracy\n\nDuring the early 17th century, Taiwan became a haven for pirates, who preyed on Chinese and Japanese shipping. The most notorious pirate to operate in Taiwanese waters was Zheng Zhilong, a Chinese pirate who later became a Ming dynasty admiral.\n\n##Japanese trade\n\nIn the 1620s, the Dutch established trade relations with Japan, which led to the establishment of a Japanese settlement in Taiwan. Japanese traders and fishermen arrived on the island, and Taiwan became an important center for the Japanese silk trade.\n\n##Spanish Formosa\n\nIn 1626, the Spanish Empire established a colony in northern Taiwan, which they called Formosa. The Spanish colony was short-lived, however, and was eventually expelled by the Dutch in 1642.\n\n##Dutch colonization\n\nThe Dutch colonization of Taiwan began in earnest in the 1630s, when the VOC established a series of fortifications and trading posts on the island. The Dutch brought with them their language, culture, and technology, which had a profound impact on the indigenous population.\n\n##Chinese settlers\n\nDuring the Dutch period, Chinese settlement in Taiwan increased significantly. Many Chinese immigrants arrived on the island, attracted by the economic opportunities offered by the Dutch.\n\n##End of Dutch rule\n\nIn 1662, the Dutch were expelled from Taiwan by the Ming dynasty loyalist Koxinga (Zheng Chenggong), who established the Kingdom of Tungning on the island. The end of Dutch rule marked the beginning of a new era in Taiwanese history.\n\n#Kingdom of Tungning (1661–1683)\n\n##Conquest\n\nKoxinga, a Ming dynasty loyalist, conquered Taiwan from the Dutch in 1662. Koxinga's victory marked the beginning of the Kingdom of Tungning, which lasted for 21 years.\n\n##Retreat to Taiwan\n\nAfter the fall of the Ming dynasty to the Qing dynasty in 1644, Koxinga and his followers retreated to Taiwan, where they established a base for resistance against the Qing.\n\n##Sinicization\n\nDuring the Kingdom of Tungning period, Taiwan underwent significant sinicization, as Chinese culture, language, and customs became more widespread on the island.\n\n##Shi Lang\n\nIn 1683, the Qing dynasty admiral Shi Lang conquered Taiwan, marking the end of the Kingdom of Tungning.\n\n##End of Zheng rule\n\nThe conquest of Taiwan by the Qing marked the end of the Zheng family's rule on the island. The Zheng family had played a significant role in Taiwanese history, particularly during the Kingdom of Tungning period.\n\n#Qing dynasty (1683–1895)\n\n##Annexation\n\nIn 1683, the Qing dynasty annexed Taiwan, incorporating it into the Fujian province.\n\n##Taiwan administration\n\nDuring the Qing period, Taiwan was administered as a prefecture of Fujian province. The Qing government established a series of administrative centers on the island, including Taipei and Tainan.\n\n##Settler expansion (1684–1795)\n\nDuring the early Qing period, Chinese settlement in Taiwan increased significantly, as immigrants arrived on the island attracted by economic opportunities.\n\n##Administrative expansion (1796–1874)\n\nIn the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the Qing government expanded its administrative presence in Taiwan, establishing new prefectures and counties.\n\n##Expansion in reaction to crises (1875–1895)\n\nIn the late 19th century, the Qing government responded to external crises, including the Opium Wars and the Sino-French War, by expanding its presence in Taiwan.\n\n##Rebellions\n\nDuring the Qing period, Taiwan experienced several rebellions, including the Lin Shuangwen Rebellion in 1787.\n\n##Invasions\n\nTaiwan was invaded by foreign powers on several occasions during the Qing period, including the British invasion of 1841 and the French invasion of 1884.\n\n##End of Qing rule\n\nIn 1895, the Qing dynasty was defeated by Japan in the First Sino-Japanese War, leading to the cession of Taiwan to Japan.\n\n#Japanese Empire (1895–1945)\n\n##Armed resistance\n\nAfter the Japanese conquest of Taiwan, there was a period of armed resistance, as Taiwanese rebels fought against Japanese rule.\n\n##Non-violent resistance\n\nIn addition to armed resistance, there were also non-violent movements against Japanese rule, including the Taiwanese Cultural Association.\n\n##Assimilation movement\n\nDuring the Japanese period, there was an assimilation movement, as the Japanese government attempted to promote Japanese language and culture in Taiwan.\n\n##Education\n\nThe Japanese government established a system of education in Taiwan, which promoted Japanese language and culture.\n\n##Japanization\n\nDuring the Japanese period, Taiwan underwent significant japanization, as Japanese culture and language became more widespread on the island.\n\n##Aboriginal policies\n\nThe Japanese government implemented policies aimed at assimilating Taiwan's indigenous population into Japanese culture.\n\n##Japanese colonists\n\nDuring the Japanese period, there was a significant influx of Japanese colonists to Taiwan, who settled primarily in the cities.\n\n##Industrialization\n\nThe Japanese government promoted industrialization in Taiwan, particularly in the areas of textiles and sugar production.\n\n##World War II\n\nDuring World War II, Taiwan played an important role in the Japanese war effort, serving as a base for military operations in Southeast Asia.\n\n##End of Japanese rule\n\nIn 1945, Japan was defeated in World War II, leading to the end of Japanese rule in Taiwan.\n\n#Republic of China (1945–present)\n\n##Taiwan under martial law\n\nAfter the Japanese surrender, Taiwan was occupied by the Republic of China (ROC), which imposed martial law on the island.\n\n##Economic development\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, Taiwan experienced rapid economic development, driven by foreign investment and government support.\n\n##Democratic reforms\n\nIn the 1980s, Taiwan underwent democratic reforms, including the lifting of martial law and the introduction of direct presidential elections.\n\n##Democratic period\n\nSince the 1990s, Taiwan has been a democratic country, with a president and legislature elected by popular vote.\n\n#See also\n\n* List of Taiwanese monarchs\n* Timeline of Taiwanese history\n* History of China\n* History of Japan\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is a general overview of the history of Taiwan.

It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, due to large-scale immigration from many countries. The geography and climate of the United States are also highly diverse, and the country is home to a wide variety of flora and fauna.\n\nEtymology\n-----------\n\nThe name \"United States of America\" was first used in the Declaration of Independence in 1776. The term \"United States\" was initially used to refer to the states that had declared independence from Great Britain. Over time, the name came to be used to refer to the federal government and the country as a whole.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\nThe history of the United States is a long and complex one, spanning thousands of years. From the earliest indigenous peoples to the present day, the country has undergone significant changes and developments.\n\n### Indigenous peoples\n\nThe first human habitation in the United States dates back to the Paleoindian period, around 15,000 years ago. Various Native American groups developed complex societies and cultures, with their own distinct languages, customs, and traditions. Many of these groups were forcibly removed from their lands by European colonizers, leading to significant population decline and cultural disruption.\n\n### European settlement and conflict (1607–1765)\n\nIn 1607, the English established the Jamestown settlement in present-day Virginia, marking the beginning of European colonization in the United States. Over the next several decades, other European powers, including the Spanish, French, and Dutch, also established colonies in North America. Conflict between European colonizers and Native American groups was frequent, and many Native Americans were forced to relocate or were killed by disease and violence.\n\n### American Revolution and the early republic (1765–1800)\n\nTensions between the British government and the American colonies led to the outbreak of the American Revolution in 1775. The Continental Army, led by George Washington, fought against the British Army and its allies, ultimately securing American independence with the Treaty of Paris in 1783. The United States Constitution was ratified in 1788, establishing a federal system of government and the principles of democracy.\n\n### Westward expansion and Civil War (1800–1865)\n\nThe United States experienced significant westward expansion during the 19th century, driven by the desire for land, resources, and economic growth. The Louisiana Purchase of 1803 and the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848 significantly expanded U.S. territory. However, the issue of slavery became increasingly divisive, leading to the secession of several Southern states and the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861. The war resulted in the abolition of slavery and a more centralized federal government.\n\n### Post–Civil War era (1865–1917)\n\nReconstruction and industrialization characterized the post-Civil War era in the United States. The country experienced rapid economic growth, urbanization, and immigration, leading to significant social and cultural changes. The Spanish-American War of 1898 marked the emergence of the United States as a global military power.\n\n### Rise as a superpower (1917–1945)\n\nThe United States entered World War I in 1917 and played a significant role in the Allied victory. The Roaring Twenties were marked by cultural and economic growth, but the Great Depression of the 1930s led to widespread poverty and unemployment. The United States' entry into World War II in 1941 marked a significant turning point in the country's history, as it emerged as one of the world's two superpowers.\n\n### Cold War (1945–1991)\n\nThe Cold War was a period of ideological and military tension between the United States and the Soviet Union. The United States played a significant role in the formation of international institutions, such as the United Nations and NATO, and engaged in proxy wars and espionage activities around the world. The Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s led to significant social and legislative changes, including the abolition of segregation and the passage of the Voting Rights Act.\n\n### Contemporary (1991–present)\n\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 marked the end of the Cold War and the beginning of a new era of globalization and terrorism. The United States has continued to play a significant role in international affairs, engaging in conflicts in the Middle East and North Africa, and addressing global challenges such as climate change and pandemics.\n\nGeography\n----------\n\nThe United States is a large and geographically diverse country, covering an area of approximately 3.8 million square miles. It borders Canada to the north and Mexico to the south, and has a coastline along the Atlantic, Pacific, and Arctic Oceans.\n\n### Climate\n\nThe climate of the United States varies significantly depending on the region. The country can be broadly divided into several climate zones, including the tropical south, the temperate east coast, the mountainous west, and the dry southwest. The country is prone to natural disasters, including hurricanes, tornadoes, and wildfires.\n\n### Biodiversity and conservation\n\nThe United States is home to a wide variety of flora and fauna, including many endemic species. The country has a number of national parks and wildlife refuges, which provide habitat for endangered species and protect natural ecosystems. However, the country's natural environment is also threatened by human activities, including deforestation, pollution, and climate change.\n\nGovernment and politics\n----------------------\n\nThe United States is a federal republic, with a system of government based on the principles of democracy and representation. The country is divided into fifty states, each with its own government and laws, as well as a federal district and various territories.\n\n### National government\n\nThe federal government is composed of three branches: the legislative, executive, and judicial. The legislative branch is composed of Congress, which is divided into the Senate and the House of Representatives. The executive branch is headed by the President, who is both the head of state and the head of government. The judicial branch is composed of the Supreme Court and other federal courts.\n\n### Political parties\n\nThe United States has a two-party system, with the Democratic Party and the Republican Party being the two dominant parties. Other parties, including the Libertarian Party and the Green Party, also play a role in the country's politics.\n\n### Subdivisions\n\nThe United States is divided into fifty states, each with its own government and laws. The states are further divided into counties, cities, and towns, which have varying levels of autonomy.\n\n### Foreign relations\n\nThe United States plays a significant role in international affairs, with diplomatic relations with over 180 countries. The country is a member of various international organizations, including the United Nations, NATO, and the G7.\n\n### Military\n\nThe United States has a powerful military, with a budget of over $700 billion. The country's military is divided into several branches, including the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps.\n\n### Law enforcement and criminal justice\n\nThe United States has a complex system of law enforcement and criminal justice, with multiple levels of jurisdiction and overlapping agencies. The country's prison system is one of the largest in the world, with over 2 million inmates.\n\nEconomy\n--------\n\nThe United States has a mixed economy, with a combination of public and private ownership. The country is one of the world's largest economies, with a GDP of over $22 trillion.\n\n### Science, technology, spaceflight and energy\n\nThe United States is a leader in scientific research and technological innovation, with significant investments in fields such as space exploration, renewable energy, and biotechnology.\n\n### Transportation\n\nThe United States has a comprehensive transportation system, with a network of roads, highways, airports, and seaports.

Wade by the Supreme Court of the United States. The protests, which began in May 2022, have continued into 2024, with demonstrators advocating for reproductive rights and access to abortion services.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\n### Leaked draft opinion\n\nOn May 2, 2022, a draft opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito was leaked to the media, indicating that the Supreme Court was poised to overturn Roe v. Wade, a landmark decision that had guaranteed a woman's right to abortion since 1973. The leaked draft opinion sparked widespread outrage and concern among reproductive rights advocates, who feared that the overturning of Roe v. Wade would lead to the erosion of access to abortion services across the United States.\n\n### Overturning of Roe v. Wade\n\nOn June 24, 2022, the Supreme Court officially released its decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, overturning Roe v. Wade and effectively ending the constitutional right to abortion in the United States. The decision was met with immediate protests and demonstrations across the country, as reproductive rights advocates vowed to continue fighting for access to abortion services.\n\nProtests before the ruling\n-------------------------\n\n### Midwest\n\nProtests took place in several Midwestern cities, including Chicago, Illinois, and Detroit, Michigan.

However, reproductive rights advocates have pushed back, arguing that the protests are peaceful and that the justices are public figures who should be held accountable for their actions.\n\nProtests after the ruling\n-------------------------\n\n### 2022\n\nFollowing the overturning of Roe v.

Born on January 6, 1412, in Domremy, a small village in northeastern France, Joan is considered one of the most famous women in French history. Her bravery, faith, and determination inspired a nation and have made her a legendary figure around the world.\n\n# Name\n\nJoan of Arc's name is derived from the French \"Jeanne d'Arc,\" which means \"Joan of Arc\" or \"Joan the Maid.\" She was also known as \"La Pucelle,\" which means \"The Maid\" in French. Her surname \"Arc\" refers to her father's name, Jacques Arc, and her family's connection to the village of Arc in northeastern France.\n\n# Birth and historical background\n\nJoan of Arc was born in 1412, during a time of great turmoil in France. The Hundred Years' War, a series of conflicts between England and France, had been raging for nearly 80 years, and the French monarchy was weak and divided. The country was also experiencing a period of economic and social unrest, which would later contribute to the rise of the French Revolution.\n\nJoan's birthplace, Domremy, was a small village located in the region of Lorraine, near the border with Germany. The village was surrounded by rolling hills and forests, and the local economy was based on agriculture and trade. Joan's family was considered to be of modest means, but they were well-respected in the community.\n\n# Early life\n\nJoan of Arc grew up in a devoutly Catholic family and was raised with a strong sense of faith and morality. Her parents, Jacques and Isabelle Arc, were both practicing Catholics who attended church regularly and encouraged their children to do the same. Joan's early life was marked by a series of visions and spiritual experiences, which would later become a central part of her story.\n\nAs a child, Joan helped her mother with household chores and tended to the family's animals. She also spent time playing in the surrounding countryside, where she developed a love of nature and the outdoors. Joan's family was known to be kind and generous, and they often took in travelers and strangers who were passing through the village.\n\n# Chinon\n\nIn 1429, at the age of 17, Joan of Arc traveled to the city of Vaucouleurs, where she petitioned Robert de Baudricourt, the garrison commander, for an escort to take her to the French court at Chinon. Baudricourt was skeptical of Joan's claims, but she eventually won him over and was given a small group of men to escort her to Chinon.\n\nJoan arrived at Chinon on February 23, 1429, and was granted an audience with Charles VII, the King of France. Charles was impressed by Joan's confidence and determination, and he decided to send her to the city of Orléans, which was under siege by the English.\n\n# Military campaigns\n\n## Orléans\n\nJoan of Arc arrived at Orléans on April 29, 1429, and quickly became involved in the city's defense. She led a series of successful attacks against the English, and on May 8, 1429, the English abandoned their siege and retreated from the city. The victory at Orléans was a major turning point in the war, and it marked the beginning of a series of French victories that would ultimately lead to the capture of Paris and the coronation of Charles VII as King of France.\n\n## Loire Campaign\n\nFollowing the victory at Orléans, Joan of Arc led a series of campaigns along the Loire River, where she captured several key cities and fortresses from the English. Her successes were marked by a series of victories at the battles of Jargeau, Meung-sur-Loire, and Beaugency, and she quickly became known as a brilliant and fearless military leader.\n\n## Coronation and siege of Paris\n\nIn July 1429, Joan of Arc led the French army to the city of Reims, where Charles VII was crowned King of France. The coronation was a major ceremony, and it marked the beginning of a new era in French history.\n\nFollowing the coronation, Joan of Arc led the French army to the city of Paris, where they laid siege to the city. The siege was marked by a series of brutal battles, and Joan was wounded in the fighting. Despite her injuries, she continued to lead the French army, and on September 8, 1429, the French captured the city of Paris.\n\n## Campaign against Perrinet Gressart\n\nIn the spring of 1430, Joan of Arc led a campaign against Perrinet Gressart, a French nobleman who had defected to the English. The campaign was marked by a series of battles, and Joan was eventually captured by Gressart's men.\n\n## Siege of Compiègne and capture\n\nIn May 1430, Joan of Arc led a campaign against the city of Compiègne, which was under siege by the English. The campaign was marked by a series of battles, and on May 23, 1430, Joan was captured by the English while attempting to escape from the city.\n\n# Trials and execution\n\n## Trial\n\nJoan of Arc was put on trial in the city of Rouen, where she was accused of heresy and witchcraft. The trial was marked by a series of irregularities, and Joan was subjected to intense questioning and pressure.\n\nDespite the efforts of her interrogators, Joan refused to recant her claims or deny her visions. She maintained that she had been sent by God to lead the French army to victory, and she refused to apologize for her actions.\n\n## Execution\n\nOn May 30, 1431, Joan of Arc was led to the market square in Rouen, where she was burned at the stake. The execution was a public spectacle, and it was attended by thousands of people.\n\n## Aftermath and rehabilitation trial\n\nFollowing Joan's execution, there was a public outcry in France, and many people demanded that she be rehabilitated. In 1456, a rehabilitation trial was held in Paris, where Joan's claims were vindicated and her name was cleared.\n\n# Visions\n\nJoan of Arc's visions were a central part of her story, and they played a major role in her military campaigns. She claimed to have seen visions of Saint Catherine, Saint Margaret, and the Archangel Michael, who told her to lead the French army to victory.\n\nJoan's visions were often intense and vivid, and they seemed to give her a sense of purpose and direction. She believed that she was being guided by God, and she was willing to risk her life to fulfill her mission.\n\n# Clothing\n\nJoan of Arc's clothing was simple and practical, reflecting her peasant origins and her role as a military leader. She wore a suit of armor and carried a sword, and she often wore a cloak and a hat to protect herself from the elements.\n\nDespite her practical clothing, Joan was known to be fashion-conscious, and she often wore her hair long and styled it in a fashionable way. She was also known to wear a pair of earrings and a ring, which were given to her by her parents.\n\n# Legacy\n\n## Military leader and symbol of France\n\nJoan of Arc is remembered as a brilliant and fearless military leader, who led the French army to several victories during the Hundred Years' War. She is also remembered as a symbol of France, and her image has been used to represent the country and its people.\n\n## Saint and heroic woman\n\nJoan of Arc was canonized as a saint in 1920, and she is remembered as a heroic woman who risked her life to fulfill her mission. She is also remembered as a role model for women, who has inspired countless people around the world.\n\n# See also\n\n* Hundred Years' War\n* Charles VII of France\n* English monarchy\n* French monarchy\n* Catholic Church\n\n# References\n\n## Notes\n\n* This article is based on a variety of sources, including historical accounts, biographies, and scholarly articles.\n* The article has been written in a neutral and encyclopedic style, reflecting the facts and opinions of the sources.\n\n## Citations\n\n* This article does not include any citations or references.\n* The information in the article is based on a variety of sources, including historical accounts, biographies, and scholarly articles.\n\n## Sources\n\n* This article does not include any sources.\n* The information in the article is based on a variety of sources, including historical accounts, biographies, and scholarly articles.\n\n# External links\n\n* Joan of Arc at the Encyclopædia Britannica\n* Joan of Arc at the Catholic Encyclopedia\n* Joan of Arc at the Metropolitan Museum of Art", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Joan_of_Arc\" following this outline:\n\n#Name\n#Birth and historical background\n#Early life\n#Chinon\n#Military campaigns\n##Orléans\n##Loire Campaign\n##Coronation and siege of Paris\n##Campaign against Perrinet Gressart\n##Siege of Compiègne and capture\n#Trials and execution\n##Trial\n##Execution\n##Aftermath and rehabilitation trial\n#Visions\n#Clothing\n#Legacy\n##Military leader and symbol of France\n##Saint and heroic woman\n#See also\n#References\n##Notes\n##Citations\n##Sources\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

These militias were integrated into the Russian military and played a key role in the invasion.\n\n## Reserve units of the Russian Armed Forces\n\nRussia mobilized several reserve units of the Russian Armed Forces in 2022, including units from the Territorial Defense Forces and the National Guard.

The name \"Pishdadian\" is derived from the Persian word \"pishdad,\" meaning \"benefactor\" or \"benevolent ruler.\"\n\n# Origins, etymology and sources\n\nThe term \"Pishdadian\" is derived from the Persian word \"pishdad,\" which is a combination of \"pish,\" meaning \"before\" or \"prior,\" and \"dad,\" meaning \"law\" or \"justice.\" This etymology suggests that the Pishdadian kings were seen as the first rulers to establish law and order in the world.\n\nThe primary sources for the Pishdadian dynasty are the Shahnameh, a epic poem written by Ferdowsi in the 10th century CE, and the works of Muslim historians such as Tabari (838-923 CE) and Masudi (896-956 CE). The Shahnameh is considered the most authoritative source for the Pishdadian dynasty, as it provides a detailed account of the kings and their exploits.\n\n# The Shahnameh and Zoroastrian tradition\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Shahnameh tells the story of the Pishdadian dynasty, which is said to have ruled Iran from the dawn of time to the Arab conquest in 651 CE. The epic poem describes the Pishdadian kings as heroic figures who fought against the forces of evil and established justice and order in the world.\n\n## The kings\n\nThe Shahnameh lists the following Pishdadian kings:\n\n1. Gayomarth, the first king, who is said to have established the dynasty and ruled for 30 years.\n2. Hushang, who discovered fire and introduced agriculture.\n3. Tahmuras, who defeated the evil spirit Ahriman and established the first social hierarchy.\n4. Jamshid, who built the city of Persepolis and introduced the arts and sciences.\n5. Dahhak, who was corrupted by the evil spirit Iblis and became a tyrant.\n6. Fredon, who defeated Dahhak and restored justice and order.\n7. Iraj, who was killed by his brothers and became a martyr.\n8. Manuchehr, who avenged Iraj's death and established a new order.\n9. Naudar, who was defeated by the Turks and lost the throne.\n10. Zaw, who was the last Pishdadian king and was defeated by the Arabs.\n\n# Tabari and the Muslim narratives\n\n## The first Pishdadian kings and the conflict with Iblis\n\nTabari's History of the Prophets and Kings provides a similar account of the Pishdadian dynasty, but with some differences. According to Tabari, the first Pishdadian king was Gayomarth, who was created by God to rule over the world. However, Iblis, the evil spirit, corrupted Gayomarth and led him to sin.\n\n## From Jam al-Shidh to Zaw: al-Dahhak and war with the Turks\n\nTabari's account of the Pishdadian kings is similar to the Shahnameh, but with some variations. He lists the following kings:\n\n1. Jam al-Shidh, who built the city of Babylon.\n2. al-Dahhak, who was corrupted by Iblis and became a tyrant.\n3. Fredon, who defeated al-Dahhak and restored justice and order.\n4. Iraj, who was killed by his brothers and became a martyr.\n5. Manuchehr, who avenged Iraj's death and established a new order.\n6. Naudar, who was defeated by the Turks and lost the throne.\n7. Zaw, who was the last Pishdadian king and was defeated by the Arabs.\n\n# Significance\n\nThe Pishdadian dynasty is significant in Persian mythology and history, as it represents the first rulers of Iran and the establishment of law and order in the world. The Pishdadian kings are seen as heroic figures who fought against the forces of evil and established justice and order.\n\n# Notes\n\nThe Pishdadian dynasty is not recognized as a historical dynasty by modern scholars, as there is no archaeological or historical evidence to support its existence. However, the legend of the Pishdadian dynasty remains an important part of Persian mythology and cultural heritage.\n\n# References\n\nNo references are cited in this article.\n\n# Bibliography\n\n## Translations of original sources\n\n* Ferdowsi, Shahnameh, translated by Reuben Levy (1967).\n* Tabari, History of the Prophets and Kings, translated by C.

The storm brought strong winds, heavy rainfall, and significant disruption to several regions, including Japan, the Korean Peninsula, and other areas. This article provides an overview of the meteorological history, preparations, impact, and aftermath of Typhoon Khanun.\n\n# Meteorological history\n\nTyphoon Khanun formed as a tropical depression on August 5, 2023, in the western Pacific Ocean, approximately 1,000 km (620 miles) southeast of Okinawa, Japan. The system intensified rapidly, becoming a tropical storm on August 6 and a typhoon on August 7. Khanun continued to strengthen, reaching its peak intensity on August 10 with maximum sustained winds of 220 km/h (137 mph) and a minimum central pressure of 920 hPa (27.17 inHg).\n\nThe typhoon moved northwestward, affecting the Ryukyu Islands of Japan on August 11. Khanun then turned northward, making landfall on the Korean Peninsula on August 13. The storm weakened rapidly after making landfall, becoming a tropical depression on August 14 and dissipating on August 15.\n\n# Preparations, impact, and aftermath\n\n## Japan\n\nIn Japan, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) issued warnings for strong winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surges in advance of Typhoon Khanun. Residents in the Ryukyu Islands were advised to evacuate to higher ground or shelters, while flights and ferry services were suspended. The Japanese government also deployed troops to assist with disaster relief efforts.\n\nThe typhoon brought strong winds and heavy rainfall to the Ryukyu Islands, causing widespread power outages and damage to buildings and infrastructure. The city of Naha, the capital of Okinawa Prefecture, reported winds of up to 180 km/h (112 mph). The storm also caused significant disruption to air and sea transportation, with over 100 flights canceled and several ports closed.\n\n## Korean Peninsula\n\nIn the Korean Peninsula, the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) issued warnings for strong winds, heavy rainfall, and flooding in advance of Typhoon Khanun. Residents in the southern provinces of Jeju and South Jeolla were advised to evacuate to higher ground or shelters, while flights and ferry services were suspended.\n\nThe typhoon made landfall on the Korean Peninsula on August 13, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall to the southern provinces. The city of Jeju reported winds of up to 150 km/h (93 mph), while the city of Busan reported rainfall of over 200 mm (7.9 in). The storm caused significant disruption to air and sea transportation, with over 50 flights canceled and several ports closed.\n\n## Elsewhere\n\nIn other countries, Typhoon Khanun also caused significant disruption. In Taiwan, the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) issued warnings for strong winds and heavy rainfall, while flights and ferry services were suspended. The storm also caused significant disruption to air and sea transportation in the Philippines and China.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of typhoons in 2023\n* Typhoon season\n* Tropical cyclone\n* Severe weather\n* Natural disasters\n\n# References\n\n(Note: No references are included in this article)\n\n# External links\n\n(Note: No external links are included in this article)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Typhoon_Khanun_(2023)\" following this outline:\n\n#Meteorological history\n#Preparations, impact, and aftermath\n##Japan\n##Korean Peninsula\n##Elsewhere\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The counteroffensive, which began on September 6, 2022, aimed to retake control of the region from Russian forces and marked a significant turning point in the conflict.\n\n#Background\n\nThe Kharkiv Oblast had been under partial Russian control since the early days of the invasion, with Russian forces advancing deep into the region and capturing several key cities, including Izium and Kupiansk. Ukrainian forces had been attempting to hold back the Russian advance, but had been largely unsuccessful in retaking control of the region. The situation on the ground had become increasingly dire, with reports of widespread human rights abuses and destruction of infrastructure.\n\n#Prelude\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the counteroffensive, Ukrainian forces had been quietly building up their strength in the region, with reports of significant troop movements and equipment deployments. The Ukrainian military had also been conducting a series of small-scale attacks on Russian positions, aimed at weakening their defenses and disrupting their supply lines.\n\n#Counteroffensive\n\n##First phase (6–12 September 2022)\n\n###Initial advance\n\nThe counteroffensive began on September 6, 2022, with Ukrainian forces launching a series of coordinated attacks on Russian positions across the Kharkiv Oblast. The initial advance was marked by rapid gains, with Ukrainian forces quickly retaking control of several key villages and towns. The Russian military responded with heavy artillery fire and airstrikes, but were unable to halt the Ukrainian advance.\n\n###Breakthrough\n\nOn September 8, 2022, Ukrainian forces achieved a major breakthrough, breaking through Russian defenses and advancing deep into the region. The Russian military was caught off guard, and was quickly overwhelmed by the scale and ferocity of the Ukrainian attack. Reports emerged of widespread chaos and disorganization within the Russian ranks, with many soldiers fleeing or surrendering.\n\n###Russian withdrawal from Kharkiv Oblast west of Oskil River\n\nAs the Ukrainian advance continued, Russian forces began to withdraw from the Kharkiv Oblast west of the Oskil River. The withdrawal was marked by reports of widespread destruction and looting, with Russian soldiers leaving behind significant amounts of equipment and supplies. The Ukrainian military quickly moved to secure the liberated territory, establishing new defensive positions and beginning the process of rebuilding and restoring critical infrastructure.\n\n###Other gains and casualties\n\nIn addition to the significant gains made in the Kharkiv Oblast, Ukrainian forces also reported successes in other parts of the country. The Ukrainian military announced the recapture of several key towns and villages in the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, and reported significant casualties among Russian forces. The Russian military, however, disputed these claims, and reported that their forces had inflicted heavy casualties on the Ukrainian military.\n\n##Battle of Shevchenkove\n\nThe Battle of Shevchenkove was a key engagement fought during the first phase of the counteroffensive. Ukrainian forces launched a series of attacks on Russian positions in the town of Shevchenkove, which was a key stronghold for Russian forces in the region. The battle was marked by intense fighting and heavy casualties on both sides, but ultimately ended in a Ukrainian victory.\n\n##Second phase (13 September–1 October 2022)\n\n###Oskil River crossing\n\nOn September 13, 2022, Ukrainian forces launched a major operation to cross the Oskil River, which marked the boundary between the Kharkiv and Donetsk oblasts. The operation was marked by intense fighting and heavy casualties, but ultimately ended in a Ukrainian success. The crossing of the Oskil River marked a significant milestone in the counteroffensive, and paved the way for further advances into the Donetsk Oblast.\n\n###Encirclement and recapture of Lyman\n\nOn September 30, 2022, Ukrainian forces encircled and recaptured the town of Lyman, which was a key stronghold for Russian forces in the Donetsk Oblast. The battle was marked by intense fighting and heavy casualties, but ultimately ended in a Ukrainian victory. The recapture of Lyman marked a significant turning point in the conflict, and dealt a major blow to Russian forces in the region.\n\n#Reactions\n\n##Russia\n\nThe Russian government responded to the counteroffensive with a mix of outrage and defiance. Russian President Vladimir Putin condemned the Ukrainian military's actions as \"aggressive\" and \"provocative,\" and vowed to take \"all necessary measures\" to protect Ru", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Kharkiv_counteroffensive\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Prelude\n#Counteroffensive\n##First phase (6–12 September 2022)\n###Initial advance\n###Breakthrough\n###Russian withdrawal from Kharkiv Oblast west of Oskil River\n###Other gains and casualties\n##Battle of Shevchenkove\n##Second phase (13 September–1 October 2022)\n###Oskil River crossing\n###Encirclement and recapture of Lyman\n#Reactions\n##Russia\n##Worldwide\n#Aftermath of the first phase\n##Mass graves and evidence of torture\n##Military decorations\n##Effect on Russian referendums\n##Captured Russian equipment\n#Aftermath of the second phase\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The coup was the latest in a series of military interventions in the country's history, which has experienced several coups and attempted coups since gaining independence in 1960.\n\n# Background\n\nNiger, a landlocked country in West Africa, has struggled with instability and insecurity in recent years, particularly in the north and west where extremist groups have launched frequent attacks. The country has also faced significant economic challenges, including a severe food crisis and high levels of poverty. The government of President Mohamed Bazoum, who came to power in 2021, has faced criticism for its handling of these issues.\n\nIn the months leading up to the coup, tensions had been rising between the government and the military, with some soldiers expressing dissatisfaction with the government's response to the security crisis and the country's economic woes. There were also reports of a power struggle within the military, with some officers reportedly loyal to Bazoum and others opposed to him.\n\n# Events\n\n## 26 July\n\n### Bazoum's detention\n\nOn the morning of 26 July, President Mohamed Bazoum was detained by a group of military officers at the presidential palace in Niamey, the capital city. The officers, who were reportedly led by General Abdourahamane Tchiani, a former head of the presidential guard, took control of the palace and surrounding areas.\n\n### Military mobilization\n\nFollowing Bazoum's detention, military units began to mobilize in Niamey and other parts of the country. Armored vehicles and troops were deployed on the streets, and the airport and other key installations were taken over by the military.\n\n### Announcement of Bazoum's overthrow\n\nIn the evening of 26 July, a group of military officers appeared on state television to announce that Bazoum had been overthrown. The officers, who identified themselves as the National Council for the Safeguard of the Homeland (CNSP), declared that they had taken power to restore stability and security in the country.\n\n## 27 July\n\n### Bazoum's response\n\nOn 27 July, President Bazoum, who was still being held by the military, released a statement condemning the coup and calling on his supporters to resist the new military government. Bazoum's statement was broadcast on social media and other channels, and it helped to galvanize opposition to the coup.\n\n### Military recognition of the junta\n\nDespite Bazoum's statement, the military continued to consolidate its power, and on 27 July, the CNSP was recognized as the new government by the military high command. The CNSP announced that it would establish a transitional government to rule the country until new elections could be held.\n\n## 28 July\n\nOn 28 July, the CNSP announced that it had appointed a new prime minister and government, and that it would begin to implement its program to restore stability and security in the country. The CNSP also announced that it would respect the country's international obligations and maintain good relations with its neighbors and partners.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe aftermath of the coup has been marked by a mixture of calm and tension. The military has maintained a strong presence on the streets, and there have been reports of arrests and detentions of opposition figures and journalists. However, the CNSP has also taken steps to reassure the public and the international community that it is committed to democracy and human rights.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## Domestic\n\nThe reaction to the coup within Niger has been mixed. Some people have welcomed the military takeover, seeing it as a necessary step to restore stability and security in the country. Others have condemned the coup, seeing it as a threat to democracy and human rights.\n\n## International\n\nThe international community has also been divided in its response to the coup. Some countries, such as France and the United States, have condemned the coup and called for the restoration of democratic rule. Others, such as China and Russia, have taken a more neutral stance, calling for calm and stability.\n\n# Analysis\n\nThe 2023 Nigerien coup d'état is a complex and multifaceted event that reflects the deep-seated challenges facing Niger and the wider region. The coup is a symptom of the country's chronic instability and insecurity, and it highlights the need for sustained international support and engagement to help Niger build a more stable and prosperous future.\n\nThe coup also raises important questions about the role of the military in African politics and the challenges of building democratic institutions in fragile states. As the situation in Niger continues to evolve, it is clear that the international community will need to play a careful and nuanced role in supporting the country's transition to democracy and stability.\n\n# Notes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Nigerien_coup_d'état\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Events\n##26 July\n###Bazoum's detention\n###Military mobilization\n###Announcement of Bazoum's overthrow\n##27 July\n###Bazoum's response\n###Military recognition of the junta\n##28 July\n#Aftermath\n#Reactions\n##Domestic\n##International\n#Analysis\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Banners are often decorated with the lodge's name, number, and other insignia.\n\n##Use of \"Royal\"\n\nThe RAOB is permitted to use the prefix \"Royal\" due to a grant from King Edward VII in 1906. This grant was made in recognition of the Order's charitable work and its promotion of fraternal values.\n\n##Dispensations\n\nA dispensation is a permit that allows a Minor Lodge to operate under the auspices of the RAOB.

The rebellion was led by Yevgeny Prigozhin, the founder of the Wagner Group, a Russian private military company, and was directed against the Russian government. The event marked a rare instance of open defiance against the government of President Vladimir Putin and highlighted the complex and often tense relationship between the Russian state and its various security forces.\n\n#Background\n\n##Yevgeny Prigozhin and the Wagner Group\n\nYevgeny Prigozhin, a Russian businessman and mercenary leader, founded the Wagner Group in 2014. The group was initially composed of Russian veterans of the Ukrainian conflict and was later expanded to include fighters from other countries. Wagner's primary goal was to provide military support to the Russian government in various conflicts, including the Syrian Civil War and the invasion of Ukraine. Prigozhin's relationship with the Russian government was complex, and while he was known to have close ties with Putin, he also maintained a degree of independence and autonomy.\n\n##Internal tensions during the invasion of Ukraine\n\nDuring the Russian invasion of Ukraine, tensions arose within the Wagner Group. Some members of the group were dissatisfied with the Russian military's strategy and tactics, which they saw as ineffective and too cautious. Others were frustrated with the lack of support and resources provided by the Russian government. These tensions eventually boiled over, leading to a rift between Prigozhin and the Russian Ministry of Defense.\n\n###Order to integrate Wagner\n\nIn May 2023, the Russian Ministry of Defense ordered the Wagner Group to integrate into the Russian military. This move was seen by many as an attempt to bring the group under greater government control and to limit Prigozhin's independence. However, Prigozhin resisted the order, arguing that it would undermine the group's effectiveness and autonomy.\n\n##Planning the rebellion\n\nFollowing the order to integrate, Prigozhin began secretly planning a rebellion against the Russian government. He reportedly reached out to other dissatisfied groups and individuals within the Russian security forces, seeking to build a coalition of support for his cause. Prigozhin also allegedly made contact with foreign governments and intelligence agencies, seeking financial and military support for his planned uprising.\n\n#Rebellion\n\n##Prigozhin's statements\n\nOn June 23, 2023, Prigozhin released a statement in which he rebuked the Russian government for its handling of the war in Ukraine. He also alleged that the government had launched a secret attack on the Wagner Group, seeking to destroy the organization and silence its leaders.\n\n###Rebukes of the government and allegation of an attack on Wagner\n\nIn his statement, Prigozhin accused the Russian government of corruption, incompetence, and betrayal. He claimed that the government had failed to provide adequate support to the Wagner Group, leading to unnecessary losses and suffering. Prigozhin also alleged that the government had launched a secret attack on the group, seeking to destroy it and silence its leaders.\n\n###Call to rebellion\n\nPrigozhin's statement ended with a call to rebellion, in which he urged Russians to rise up against the government and demand change. He promised that the Wagner Group would lead the charge, using its military might to bring about a new era of freedom and prosperity.\n\n##Capture of Rostov-on-Don\n\nOn June 24, 2023, the Wagner Group launched a surprise attack on the city of Rostov-on-Don, a key military hub in southern Russia. The group quickly overran the city, capturing key government buildings and infrastructure. Prigozhin declared that the city was now under the control of the Wagner Group and promised to use it as a base for further operations.\n\n##Advance towards Moscow\n\nFollowing the capture of Rostov-on-Don, the Wagner Group began to advance towards Moscow. The group's fighters moved rapidly, using their military vehicles and equipment to overcome government forces. However, the advance was eventually halted by a combination of government troops and loyalist militias.\n\n##Security measures\n\nIn response to the rebellion, the Russian government imposed a range of security measures. A state of emergency was declared, and troops were deployed to key cities and infrastructure. The government also imposed strict controls on the media, seeking to limit the spread of news about the rebellion.\n\n##Events in Syria\n\nThe rebellion also had an impact on Russia's military operations in Syria. The Wagner Group had been involved in the conflict, providing support to the Syrian government. However, following the outbreak of the rebellion, the group's fighters in Syria were reportedly ordered to return to Russia and join the fight against the government.\n\n#Resolution\n\nThe rebellion was eventually brought to an end through a combination of military force and negotiations. The Russian government launched a series of attacks on the Wagner Group's positions, using air power and artillery to weaken the group's defenses. At the same time, government officials entered into secret talks with Prigozhin, seeking to persuade him to stand down and negotiate a peaceful resolution.\n\n#Reactions\n\n##Domestic\n\n###Vladimir Putin's address\n\nOn June 25, 2023, President Vladimir Putin delivered a televised address to the nation. In his speech, Putin condemned the rebellion and promised to take tough action against those responsible. He also sought to reassure Russians that the government was in control and that the situation was under control.\n\n###Other government-aligned figures\n\nOther government-aligned figures also spoke out against the rebellion. The Russian Ministry of Defense released a statement condemning the Wagner Group's actions and promising to take action against those responsible. The Russian media also played a key role in shaping public opinion, with many outlets portraying the rebellion as a threat to national stability and security.\n\n###Anti-war opposition and anti-government armed groups\n\nThe rebellion also received support from some anti-war opposition groups and anti-government armed groups. These groups saw the uprising as an opportunity to challenge the Russian government and bring about change. However, their support was limited, and the rebellion ultimately failed to gain widespread backing.\n\n###Ultranationalists and milbloggers\n\nSome ultranationalists and milbloggers also supported the rebellion, seeing it as a way to challenge the Russian government and push for a more aggressive foreign policy. However, their support was also limited, and the rebellion ultimately failed to gain widespread backing.\n\n###Wider public\n\nThe wider public was divided in its response to the rebellion. Some Russians saw the uprising as a threat to national stability and security, while others saw it as an opportunity for change. However, the majority of Russians remained skeptical of the rebellion and its leaders.\n\n##International\n\nThe international community was also divided in its response to the rebellion. Some countries, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, condemned the uprising and expressed support for the Russian government. Others, such as China and Turkey, remained neutral, seeking to avoid taking sides in the conflict.\n\n#Aftermath\n\n##Fallout and restoring order\n\nFollowing the end of the rebellion, the Russian government sought to restore order and stability. Troops were deployed to key cities and infrastructure, and a range of security measures were imposed. The government also launched a crackdown on opposition groups and individuals, seeking to prevent further unrest.\n\n##Subsequent statements\n\nIn the aftermath of the rebellion, Prigozhin released a series of statements in which he sought to justify his actions. He claimed that the uprising had been necessary to challenge the Russian government and bring about change. However, his statements were widely criticized, and he was eventually forced to flee Russia to avoid arrest.\n\n##Fate of the Wagner Group and Yevgeny Prigozhin\n\n###Closure of criminal case and initial statements\n\nIn the aftermath of the rebellion, the Russian government launched a criminal case against Prigozhin and the Wagner Group. However, the case was eventually closed, and Prigozhin was allowed to return to Russia. In a series of initial statements, Prigozhin sought to justify his actions and claim that the uprising had been necessary to challenge the Russian government.\n\n###Crackdown on Wagner, alleged purges and related arrests\n\nHowever, the Russian government soon launched a crackdown on the Wagner Group, seeking to dismantle the organization and punish its leaders. A number of former Wagner fighters were arrested and charged with crimes related to the rebellion. There were also reports of alleged purges within the Russian military, as the government sought to root out those who had supported the uprising.\n\n###Prigozhin's return to Russia\n\nDespite the crackdown, Prigozhin was eventually allowed to return to Russia. He claimed that he had been given assurances by the Russian government that he would not be arrested or punished for his role in the rebellion. However, his return was widely seen as a sign of the government's weakness, and he was eventually forced to go into hiding to avoid arrest.\n\n###Death of Prigozhin and Utkin\n\nOn August 23, 2023, Prigozhin and Dmitry Utkin, the commander of the Wagner Group, died in a plane crash in the Tver region of Russia. The cause of the crash was unclear, but it was widely speculated that it had been orchestrated by the Russian government. The deaths marked the end of the Wagner Group's leadership and the final collapse of the organization.\n\n##Measures of NATO countries\n\nIn response to the rebellion, NATO countries took a range of measures to strengthen their military presence in Eastern Europe. Troops were deployed to key countries, and a range of security measures were imposed. The alliance also sought to increase its cooperation with Russia's neighbors, seeking to prevent further instability in the region.\n\n#Analysis\n\n##Political\n\nThe rebellion highlighted the complex and often tense relationship between the Russian state and its various security forces. It also demonstrated the willingness of some Russians to challenge the government and demand change. However, the rebellion ultimately failed to gain widespread backing, and the government was able to restore order and stability.\n\n##Military\n\nThe rebellion also highlighted the military strength and capabilities of the Wagner Group. The organization's fighters were able to capture key cities and infrastructure, and they were only eventually defeated through a combination of military force and negotiations. The rebellion demonstrated the need for the Russian government to reform its military and security forces, seeking to prevent further instability and unrest.\n\n#See also\n\n* Wagner Group\n* Yevgeny Prigozhin\n* Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* Syrian Civil War\n* Russian government\n\n#Notes\n\n#References\n\n#External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Wagner_Group_rebellion\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Yevgeny Prigozhin and the Wagner Group\n##Internal tensions during the invasion of Ukraine\n###Order to integrate Wagner\n##Planning the rebellion\n#Rebellion\n##Prigozhin's statements\n###Rebukes of the government and allegation of an attack on Wagner\n###Call to rebellion\n##Capture of Rostov-on-Don\n##Advance towards Moscow\n##Security measures\n##Events in Syria\n#Resolution\n#Reactions\n##Domestic\n###Vladimir Putin's address\n###Other government-aligned figures\n###Anti-war opposition and anti-government armed groups\n###Ultranationalists and milbloggers\n###Wider public\n##International\n#Aftermath\n##Fallout and restoring order\n##Subsequent statements\n##Fate of the Wagner Group and Yevgeny Prigozhin\n###Closure of criminal case and initial statements\n###Crackdown on Wagner, alleged purges and related arrests\n###Prigozhin's return to Russia\n###Death of Prigozhin and Utkin\n##Measures of NATO countries\n#Analysis\n##Political\n##Military\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The nonmetals are located in the upper right-hand corner of the periodic table, and they include elements such as carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, and chlorine. Nonmetals are the most abundant type of element in the universe, making up about 75% of all elements.\n\n# Definition and applicable elements\n\nThe term \"nonmetal\" was first used by the German chemist August Arfwedson in 1817 to describe elements that did not have the characteristic properties of metals. The definition of a nonmetal has evolved over time, but it is generally accepted that nonmetals are elements that do not exhibit the following properties:\n\n* Shiny appearance\n* Malleability\n* Good conductivity of electricity\n* Ability to form cations (positive ions)\n\nThere are 17 nonmetal elements in the periodic table, which include:\n\n* Carbon (C)\n* Nitrogen (N)\n* Oxygen (O)\n* Fluorine (F)\n* Neon (Ne)\n* Chlorine (Cl)\n* Argon (Ar)\n* Phosphorus (P)\n* Sulfur (S)\n* Selenium (Se)\n* Bromine (Br)\n* Krypton (Kr)\n* Iodine (I)\n* Xenon (Xe)\n* Radon (Rn)\n\n# General properties\n\nNonmetals exhibit a wide range of properties, which can be broadly classified into physical and chemical properties.\n\n## Physical\n\nNonmetals can exist in various physical states, including solid, liquid, and gas. Some nonmetals, such as carbon and sulfur, can exist in multiple allotropes, which are different physical forms of the same element.\n\n### Allotropes\n\nAllotropes are different physical forms of the same element, which can have different properties. For example, carbon can exist as diamond, graphite, and fullerene, which are all allotropes of carbon.\n\n## Chemical\n\nNonmetals exhibit a range of chemical properties, including reactivity and the ability to form compounds with other elements. Nonmetals can react with metals to form ionic compounds, and they can also react with other nonmetals to form covalent compounds.\n\n## Complications\n\nNonmetals can exhibit complications in their properties, which can make them difficult to classify.\n\n### First row anomaly\n\nThe first row anomaly refers to the fact that the elements in the first row of the periodic table (hydrogen and helium) do not follow the same trends as the other elements in their respective groups.\n\n### Secondary periodicity\n\nSecondary periodicity refers to the fact that the elements in a group can exhibit different properties due to the presence of secondary electrons, which are electrons that are not involved in bonding.\n\n### Higher oxidation states\n\nNonmetals can exhibit higher oxidation states, which are states in which the element has lost more electrons than it has gained.\n\n### Multiple bond formation\n\nNonmetals can form multiple bonds with other elements, which are bonds that involve more than one pair of electrons.\n\n### Property overlaps\n\nNonmetals can exhibit property overlaps, which are situations in which the properties of two or more elements are similar.\n\n# Types\n\nNonmetals can be classified into several types, including noble gases, halogen nonmetals, and unclassified nonmetals.\n\n## Noble gases\n\nThe noble gases are a group of nonmetals that are located in the far right-hand column of the periodic table. They are unreactive and do not readily form compounds with other elements.\n\n## Halogen nonmetals\n\nThe halogen nonmetals are a group of nonmetals that are located in the column to the left of the noble gases. They are highly reactive and readily form compounds with other elements.\n\n## Unclassified nonmetals\n\nThe unclassified nonmetals are a group of nonmetals that do not fit into any of the other categories. They include elements such as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen.\n\n# Abundance, extraction, and uses\n\nNonmetals are the most abundant type of element in the universe, making up about 75% of all elements.\n\n## Abundance\n\nNonmetals are found in a wide range of natural materials, including rocks, soil, and water.\n\n## Extraction\n\nNonmetals can be extracted from natural materials through a variety of methods, including mining, drilling, and processing.\n\n## Uses\n\nNonmetals have a wide range of uses, including:\n\n* Energy production: Nonmetals such as carbon and hydrogen are used in the production of energy.\n* Medicine: Nonmetals such as oxygen and carbon are used in medical treatments.\n* Construction: Nonmetals such as carbon and sulfur are used in the construction of buildings and roads.\n\n# Taxonomical history\n\nThe concept of nonmetals has evolved over time, and the classification of nonmetals has undergone several changes.\n\n## Background\n\nThe concept of nonmetals was first introduced by the German chemist August Arfwedson in 1817.\n\n## Organization of elements by types\n\nThe elements were first organized into types by the English chemist John Newlands in 1863.\n\n## Development of types\n\nThe development of types of nonmetals continued throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\n## Suggested distinguishing criteria\n\nSeveral criteria have been suggested for distinguishing between nonmetals and metals, including:\n\n* Shiny appearance\n* Malleability\n* Good conductivity of electricity\n* Ability to form cations (positive ions)\n\n# Comparison of selected properties\n\nThe properties of nonmetals can be compared to those of metals.\n\n## Physical properties by element type\n\nThe physical properties of nonmetals can be compared to those of metals.\n\n## Chemical properties by element type\n\nThe chemical properties of nonmetals can be compared to those of metals.\n\n# See also\n\n* Metal\n* Periodic table\n* Element\n* Compound\n\n# Notes\n\n* The classification of nonmetals is not universally agreed upon, and different sources may use different criteria to distinguish between nonmetals and metals.\n\n# References\n\n* This article does not include any references or citations.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Nonmetal\" following this outline:\n\n#Definition and applicable elements\n#General properties\n##Physical\n###Allotropes\n##Chemical\n##Complications\n###First row anomaly\n###Secondary periodicity\n###Higher oxidation states\n###Multiple bond formation\n###Property overlaps\n#Types\n##Noble gases\n##Halogen nonmetals\n##Unclassified nonmetals\n#Abundance, extraction, and uses\n##Abundance\n##Extraction\n##Uses\n#Taxonomical history\n##Background\n##Organization of elements by types\n##Development of types\n##Suggested distinguishing criteria\n#Comparison of selected properties\n##Physical properties by element type\n##Chemical properties by element type\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n##Citations\n##Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

With a career spanning over six decades, Harris established herself as a talented and versatile performer, appearing in numerous films, television shows, and stage productions.\n\n#Early life and education\n\nEstelle Harris was born on April 4, 1928, in New York City, to Isaac and Anna Nussbaum. She grew up in a low-income Jewish family in the Manhattan borough of Manhattan. Harris's early life was marked by hardship, with her family struggling to make ends meet during the Great Depression. Despite these challenges, Harris's parents encouraged her to pursue her passion for the performing arts.\n\nHarris attended the High School of Music and Art in Manhattan, where she developed her skills in singing, acting, and dancing. After graduating, she went on to study drama at the New York City College of Music. Harris's early training laid the foundation for her future success in the entertainment industry.\n\n#Career\n\nHarris began her career in the 1950s, performing in various stage productions in New York City. She made her Broadway debut in 1953, appearing in the musical \"Wonderful Town\". Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Harris worked extensively in theater, appearing in numerous Off-Broadway and Broadway productions.\n\nIn the 1970s, Harris began to transition to television, landing roles in popular sitcoms such as \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" and \"Rhoda\". Her distinctive voice and sharp wit made her a sought-after guest star, and she went on to appear in numerous television shows throughout the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nHarris's breakthrough role came in 1992, when she was cast as Estelle Costanza on the hit television series \"Seinfeld\". Her portrayal of the lovable but cantankerous mother of George Costanza (Jason Alexander) earned her widespread recognition and critical acclaim. Harris appeared in over 50 episodes of the show, becoming a fan favorite and a integral part of the series.\n\nIn addition to her work on \"Seinfeld\", Harris appeared in numerous films, including \"Toy Story 2\", \"Brother Bear\", and \"Tarzan II\". She also lent her voice to several animated television series, including \"The Wild Thornberrys\" and \"Kim Possible\".\n\n#Personal life and death\n\nHarris was married to Sy Harris, a jeweler, from 1953 until their divorce in 1963. The couple had three children together, Eric, Glen, and Taryn. Harris was known to be private about her personal life, but she was open about her struggles with weight and her experiences as a mother.\n\nOn April 2, 2022, Harris passed away at the age of 93, just two days shy of her 94th birthday. Her death was met with an outpouring of tributes from fans and fellow actors, who remembered her as a talented and beloved performer.\n\n#Filmography\n\n##Film\n\n* \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" (1970)\n* \"Wonderful Town\" (1953)\n* \"The Love Boat\" (1976)\n* \"The Golden Girls\" (1985)\n* \"Estelle Getty's Funny Ladies\" (1991)\n* \"Toy Story 2\" (1999)\n* \"Brother Bear\" (2003)\n* \"Tarzan II\" (2005)\n* \"Teacher's Pet\" (2004)\n* \"Delhi Safari\" (2012)\n\n##Television\n\n* \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" (1970-1971)\n* \"Rhoda\" (1974-1976)\n* \"The Love Boat\" (1976-1981)\n* \"The Golden Girls\" (1985-1986)\n* \"Seinfeld\" (1992-1998)\n* \"The Wild Thornberrys\" (1998-2004)\n* \"Kim Possible\" (2002-2007)\n* \"ER\" (2003-2004)\n* \"House\" (2006)\n* \" Futurama\" (2008)\n\n##Video games\n\n* \"Toy Story 2: Buzz Lightyear to the Rescue\" (1999)\n* \"Brother Bear\" (2003)\n* \"Tarzan II\" (2005)\n* \"Delhi Safari\" (2012)\n\n#Theatre\n\n* \"Wonderful Town\" (1953)\n* \"The Pajama Game\" (1954)\n* \"Gypsy\" (1959)\n* \"The Music Man\" (1960)\n* \"Funny Girl\" (1964)\n* \"Hello, Dolly!\" (1964)\n* \"Annie Get Your Gun\" (1966)\n* \"The Sound of Music\" (1966)\n* \"South Pacific\" (1967)\n* \"Fiddler on the Roof\" (1970)\n\n#References\n\n#External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Estelle_Harris\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and education\n#Career\n#Personal life and death\n#Filmography\n##Film\n##Television\n##Video games\n#Theatre\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

According to Grusch, he was recruited by a government agency in the 1990s to work on a project related to UFOs.\n\n# Grusch's Public Claims\n\nGrusch's claims about his involvement in a secret government project and his alleged encounters with extraterrestrial life have been widely publicized. According to Grusch, he was part of a team that was tasked with studying and communicating with extraterrestrial beings. He claims to have had direct interactions with these beings and to have learned about their technology and intentions.\n\nGrusch's claims include assertions about the existence of a secret government facility where UFOs are stored and studied. He also claims to have seen evidence of extraterrestrial life, including alien bodies and technology. Grusch's claims have been met with a mixture of fascination and skepticism, with some people believing him to be a credible whistleblower and others dismissing him as a hoaxer or a fantasist.\n\n# Response from Relevant Experts\n\nExperts in the fields of ufology, science, and psychology have responded to Grusch's claims with a range of opinions. Some experts have questioned the validity of Grusch's claims, citing a lack of evidence and inconsistencies in his story. Others have suggested that Grusch's claims may be the result of a psychological condition or a desire for attention.\n\nDr. Steven Novella, a neurologist and skeptic, has expressed skepticism about Grusch's claims, stating that they are \"unsubstantiated and unverifiable.\" Novella has also suggested that Grusch's claims may be the result of a psychological condition such as confabulation or the influence of suggestion.\n\n# United States Government Responses\n\nThe United States government has responded to Grusch's claims with a mixture of denial and silence. Government agencies have issued statements denying the existence of a secret project involving UFOs, and some have suggested that Grusch's claims are the result of misinformation or disinformation.\n\n## Department of Defense and NASA Statements\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) and NASA have issued statements denying the existence of a secret project involving UFOs. The DoD has stated that it has no evidence of the existence of extraterrestrial life or technology, and NASA has stated that it has no evidence of the existence of UFOs.\n\n## Congressional Action and Comments from Members\n\nMembers of Congress have also responded to Grusch's claims, with some calling for further investigation and others expressing skepticism. Representative Mike Quigley (D-IL) has introduced a bill calling for the establishment of a UFO research program, while Representative Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX) has expressed skepticism about Grusch's claims, stating that they are \"unsubstantiated and unverifiable.\"\n\n## 2023 House Committee Oversight and Accountability Hearing\n\nIn 2023, the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability held a hearing on the topic of UFOs, during which Grusch testified. The hearing was attended by several members of Congress, including Representative Quigley and Representative Jackson Lee. During the hearing, Grusch repeated his claims about the existence of a secret government project involving UFOs, and he presented evidence that he claimed supported his assertions.\n\n# Sean Kirkpatrick\n\nSean Kirkpatrick, a former Pentagon official, has also come forward with claims about the existence of a secret government project involving UFOs. Kirkpatrick's claims have been corroborated by Grusch, who has stated that Kirkpatrick was also part of the project.\n\n# Media Reporting on Grusch's Claims\n\nGrusch's claims have been widely reported in the media, with some outlets presenting them as credible and others dismissing them as a hoax. The reporting on Grusch's claims has been influenced by a range of factors, including the lack of evidence and the skepticism of experts.\n\n## Connections to Studies Funded by Robert Bigelow\n\nSome media outlets have reported on connections between Grusch's claims and studies funded by Robert Bigelow, a billionaire who has funded research into UFOs. Bigelow's company, Bigelow Aerospace, has funded research into the existence of extraterrestrial life, and some of Grusch's claims have been linked to this research.\n\n## Reporting on Psychiatric Treatment Received by Grusch\n\nSome media outlets have also reported on psychiatric treatment received by Grusch, who has stated that he has received treatment for anxiety and depression. This reporting has been used to suggest that Grusch's claims may be the result of a psychological condition.\n\n## News Stories and Commentary\n\nNews stories and commentary on Grusch's claims have been widely varied, with some outlets presenting them as credible and others dismissing them as a hoax.

The film is based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name and is set in the Sony Pictures Universe of Marvel Characters (SPUMC). The movie stars Jared Leto as the titular character, with Adria Arjona, Matt Smith, Jared Harris, and Tyrese Gibson in supporting roles.\n\nPlot\n-----\n\nThe film follows Dr. Michael Morbius, a brilliant scientist who has been suffering from a rare blood disorder since birth. Desperate to find a cure, Morbius turns to unconventional methods and experiments on himself, merging his DNA with that of a vampire bat. The procedure is successful in curing his disorder, but it also comes with a terrible cost: Morbius develops vampiric traits, including superhuman strength, speed, and agility.\n\nAs Morbius struggles to control his newfound powers, he becomes increasingly isolated from his loved ones and society. He is pursued by a group of mercenaries hired by a wealthy and powerful individual who seeks to exploit Morbius's abilities for his own gain. Along the way, Morbius must confront the darker aspects of his own nature and the monstrous creature he has become.\n\nCast\n-----\n\n* Jared Leto as Dr. Michael Morbius\n* Adria Arjona as Martine Bancroft\n* Matt Smith as Loxias Crown\n* Jared Harris as Dr. Emil Nicholas\n* Tyrese Gibson as Simon Stroud\n* Al Madrigal as Alberto Rodriguez\n* Charlie Shotwell as Young Michael Morbius\n\nProduction\n------------\n\n### Development\n\nIn 2018, Sony Pictures announced plans to develop a film based on the Marvel Comics character Morbius, with Jared Leto set to star in the title role.

The film's home media release included a number of bonus features, including deleted scenes, behind-the-scenes footage, and a featurette on the making of the film.\n\nReception\n------------\n\n### Box office\n\nMorbius opened at number one at the box office in the United States, grossing over $39 million in its opening weekend. The film went on to gross over $163 million worldwide, making it a moderate commercial success.\n\n### Critical response\n\nMorbius received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising Jared Leto's performance and the film's atmospheric visuals, while others found the story and characters to be lacking. The film holds a 57% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 212 reviews, with an average rating of 5.8/10.\n\n### Internet memes\n\nMorbius became the subject of a number of internet memes in the months leading up to its release, with many fans poking fun at the film's perceived shortcomings and Jared Leto's method acting approach. Despite this, the film's cast and crew took the memes in stride, with Jared Leto even acknowledging them in a number of interviews.\n\nFuture\n---------\n\nIn the months leading up to the release of Morbius, Sony announced plans to develop a sequel to the film, with Jared Leto set to reprise his role as the titular character.

The riots were characterized by widespread protests, vandalism, and clashes between protesters and law enforcement, resulting in significant damage to property and cultural sites.\n\n# Background\n\n## Killing of Nahel Merzouk\n\nOn June 27, 2023, Nahel Merzouk was shot and killed by a police officer during a traffic stop in Nanterre, a suburb of Paris. The incident sparked widespread outrage and protests, with many accusing the police of using excessive force and racism. The police officer involved in the shooting claimed that Merzouk had attempted to drive away, but witnesses disputed this account.\n\n## 2017 law concerning traffic stops\n\nIn 2017, France passed a law that allowed police officers to stop and search vehicles without prior authorization, which critics argued would lead to increased racial profiling and police brutality. The law was widely criticized by civil rights groups and minority communities, who argued that it would disproportionately affect people of color.\n\n## Civil unrest related to policing\n\nThe Nahel Merzouk riots were not an isolated incident, but rather part of a larger pattern of civil unrest related to policing in France. In recent years, there have been numerous high-profile cases of police brutality and racial profiling, which have sparked widespread protests and calls for reform.\n\n## Police brutality in France\n\nPolice brutality is a long-standing issue in France, with many cases of excessive force and racism reported in recent years. In 2020, the French government was forced to apologize for the police beating of a black man, which was caught on video and sparked widespread outrage.\n\n## Racial profiling and false reporting\n\nRacial profiling and false reporting are also significant problems in France. Many minority communities report being unfairly targeted by police, and there have been numerous cases of false arrests and wrongful convictions.\n\n## Social problems\n\nFrance has struggled with social problems such as poverty, unemployment, and inequality, which disproportionately affect minority communities. These social problems have contributed to widespread frustration and anger, which has fueled the riots.\n\n# Events\n\n## Metropolitan France\n\n### 27–28 June\n\nThe riots began on June 27, 2023, in Nanterre, where Nahel Merzouk was killed. Protesters clashed with police, and several vehicles were set on fire. The riots quickly spread to other suburbs of Paris, including Seine-Saint-Denis and Val-d'Oise.\n\n### 29–30 June\n\nOn June 29, 2023, the riots intensified, with protesters setting fire to buildings and cars. The police responded with tear gas and rubber bullets, but the riots continued to spread.\n\n### 1–2 July\n\nOn July 1, 2023, the government deployed the military to quell the riots. However, the situation continued to deteriorate, with protesters clashing with soldiers and police.\n\n### 3–4 July\n\nOn July 3, 2023, the government imposed a curfew in several suburbs of Paris, but the riots continued. The police reported that several officers had been injured, and several protesters had been arrested.\n\n### 8 July\n\nOn July 8, 2023, the riots subsided, but tensions remained high. The government announced that it would establish an independent commission to investigate the killing of Nahel Merzouk.\n\n### 10 July\n\nOn July 10, 2023, the government held a memorial service for Nahel Merzouk, which was attended by thousands of people. The service was marked by protests and clashes between police and protesters.\n\n## Overseas France\n\nThe riots also spread to several overseas territories of France, including Martinique and Guadeloupe. In Martinique, protesters clashed with police and set fire to buildings, while in Guadeloupe, protesters blocked roads and burned tires.\n\n## International\n\nThe Nahel Merzouk riots received international attention, with many countries condemning the police killing of Merzouk. The United Nations expressed concern about the situation, and several human rights organizations called for an independent investigation.\n\n# Damage to cultural sites\n\nThe riots resulted in significant damage to cultural sites, including museums, libraries, and historical buildings. In Paris, the famous Galeries Lafayette department store was looted, and several artworks were stolen.\n\n# Estimated cost of the riots\n\nThe estimated cost of the riots is estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of euros. The government has announced that it will establish a fund to compensate businesses and individuals affected by the riots.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## Public officials and media\n\nPublic officials and media outlets have responded to the riots with a range of opinions. Some have condemned the violence and looting, while others have expressed sympathy for the protesters and criticized the police.\n\n## Police violence\n\nThere have been reports of police violence against protesters, including beatings and arrests. The police have defended their actions, saying that they were necessary to maintain order.\n\n## Police revolt\n\nThere have been reports of a police revolt, with some officers refusing to work and others calling for the resignation of the interior minister.\n\n## Misinformation\n\nThere has been widespread misinformation about the riots, with some social media outlets spreading false reports and conspiracy theories.\n\n# See also\n\n* Police brutality in France\n* Racial profiling in France\n* Civil unrest in France\n* List of riots in France", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Nahel_Merzouk_riots\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Killing of Nahel Merzouk\n##2017 law concerning traffic stops\n##Civil unrest related to policing\n##Police brutality in France\n##Racial profiling and false reporting\n##Social problems\n#Events\n##Metropolitan France\n###27–28 June\n###29–30 June\n###1–2 July\n###3–4 July\n###8 July\n###10 July\n##Overseas France\n##International\n#Damage to cultural sites\n#Estimated cost of the riots\n#Reactions\n##Public officials and media\n##Police violence\n##Police revolt\n##Misinformation\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The path stretches from the intersection of Culver Drive and Sepulveda Boulevard in Culver City to the Pacific Ocean in Marina del Rey, passing through the cities of Los Angeles and Culver City. The bike path is a popular route for commuters, recreational cyclists, and pedestrians, offering a scenic and relatively flat ride through a variety of landscapes.\n\n# Route\nThe Ballona Creek Bike Path begins at the intersection of Culver Drive and Sepulveda Boulevard in Culver City, where it connects to the Expo Line Bike Path. From there, the path follows the course of Ballona Creek, passing through a mix of urban and natural environments. The path runs alongside the creek, which is lined with trees, bushes, and other vegetation, providing a naturalistic setting for cyclists and pedestrians.\n\n## Airport\nOne notable section of the bike path passes under the runways of Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). This section, known as the \"Airport Tunnel,\" is a 1,000-foot-long (305 m) tunnel that allows cyclists and pedestrians to safely cross under the airport's runways. The tunnel is well-lit and features a smooth, paved surface, making it a convenient and safe route for commuters and recreational cyclists alike.\n\n# Conditions\nThe Ballona Creek Bike Path is generally in good condition, with a smooth, paved surface and minimal obstacles. However, there are some sections of the path that may be prone to flooding or maintenance closures.\n\n## Rest stops\nThere are several rest stops and parks along the Ballona Creek Bike Path, providing cyclists and pedestrians with opportunities to rest, snack, and enjoy the scenery. These rest stops are typically equipped with benches, drinking fountains, and restrooms.\n\n## Homeless camping\nUnfortunately, the Ballona Creek Bike Path has experienced issues with homeless camping in the past. The path's proximity to urban areas and its relatively secluded nature have made it a magnet for homeless individuals, who often set up encampments along the creek. Efforts have been made to address this issue, including the installation of fencing and signage, as well as outreach programs aimed at providing services to homeless individuals.\n\n# Access gates\nThere are several access gates along the Ballona Creek Bike Path, allowing cyclists and pedestrians to enter and exit the path at various points. These gates are typically located at street intersections or near parking areas, making it easy for users to access the path.\n\n# History\nThe Ballona Creek Bike Path has a long history, dating back to the early 20th century. The path was originally built as a service road for the maintenance of Ballona Creek, which was used as a drainage channel for the surrounding area. Over time, the path was improved and expanded, eventually becoming a popular route for cyclists and pedestrians.\n\n# Improvements\nIn recent years, the Ballona Creek Bike Path has undergone several improvements, including the installation of new lighting, signage, and fencing. These improvements have aimed to enhance safety and accessibility along the path, making it a more enjoyable and convenient route for users.\n\n# Proposed extensions\nThere are currently several proposed extensions to the Ballona Creek Bike Path, including a potential connection to the Marvin Braude Bike Trail, also known as \"The Strand.\" This connection would allow cyclists and pedestrians to travel seamlessly from the Ballona Creek Bike Path to the Marvin Braude Bike Trail, providing a continuous route along the coast.\n\n# Gallery\n[Insert images of the Ballona Creek Bike Path]\n\n# See also\n* Expo Line Bike Path\n* Marvin Braude Bike Trail\n* Los Angeles River Bike Path\n* Ballona Creek\n* Culver City\n* Los Angeles\n\n# References\n\n# External links\n* Ballona Creek Bike Path (official website)\n* Culver City Parks and Recreation Department\n* Los Angeles County Department of Parks and Recreation\n* California Department of Transportation (Caltrans)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Ballona_Creek_Bike_Path\" following this outline:\n\n#Route\n##Airport\n#Conditions\n##Rest stops\n##Homeless camping\n#Access gates\n#History\n#Improvements\n#Proposed extensions\n#Gallery\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The earthquakes were among the strongest to hit the region in over a century, with the first quake measuring 7.8 magnitude on the moment magnitude scale. This article provides an overview of the tectonic setting, earthquake sequence, damage and casualties, aftermath, and international humanitarian efforts related to the 2023 Turkey–Syria earthquakes.\n\n# Tectonic setting\n\n## Geology\n\nThe region affected by the earthquakes is located at the boundary between the Arabian and Anatolian tectonic plates. The Arabian plate is moving northwards relative to the Anatolian plate, resulting in a zone of compression and deformation. This process has led to the formation of several major fault lines, including the East Anatolian Fault Zone (EAFZ) and the Dead Sea Rift. The EAFZ is a transform fault that runs east-west across southern Turkey and is responsible for many significant earthquakes in the region.\n\n## Seismicity\n\nThe region has a long history of seismic activity, with many earthquakes occurring along the EAFZ and other fault lines. The earthquakes are often shallow, with focal depths of less than 20 km, and are characterized by strike-slip motion. The seismicity in the region is influenced by the complex tectonic setting, with multiple fault lines interacting and producing a high level of seismic hazard.\n\n# Earthquake sequence\n\n## Aftershocks\n\nThe first earthquake, which occurred at 04:17 local time, was followed by numerous aftershocks, including several with magnitudes greater than 6.0. The aftershocks continued for several days, with the largest aftershock measuring 7.5 magnitude. The aftershock sequence was widespread, with earthquakes occurring across a broad region of southern Turkey and northern Syria.\n\n## Seismology\n\nThe earthquakes were characterized by a combination of strike-slip and normal faulting, with a significant component of vertical motion. The seismic data indicate that the earthquakes occurred on multiple fault lines, including the EAFZ and other smaller faults. The earthquakes were shallow, with focal depths of less than 20 km, and were located in a region of high seismic hazard.\n\n## Rupture propagation\n\nThe rupture propagation of the earthquakes was complex, with multiple faults interacting and producing a high level of seismic hazard. The rupture propagated east-west along the EAFZ, with a length of approximately 100 km. The rupture also propagated north-south, with a length of approximately 50 km.\n\n## Surface rupture\n\nThe earthquakes produced significant surface rupture, with multiple fault lines rupturing the surface. The surface rupture was widespread, with a length of approximately 150 km. The rupture was characterized by a combination of horizontal and vertical motion, with a maximum displacement of approximately 5 meters.\n\n## Ground motion\n\nThe earthquakes produced significant ground motion, with peak ground accelerations (PGAs) of up to 1.5 g. The ground motion was widespread, with PGAs greater than 0.5 g occurring across a broad region of southern Turkey and northern Syria.\n\n## Geological effects\n\nThe earthquakes produced significant geological effects, including landslides, rockfalls, and soil liquefaction. The landslides and rockfalls were widespread, with many occurring in mountainous regions. The soil liquefaction was significant, with many buildings and structures affected.\n\n## Tsunami\n\nThere was no tsunami associated with the earthquakes, as they were shallow and occurred in a region with a relatively low coastal elevation.\n\n## Effects on other faults\n\nThe earthquakes may have affected other faults in the region, including the Dead Sea Rift and other smaller faults. The interaction between the faults is complex, and further research is needed to understand the effects of the earthquakes on other faults.\n\n# Damage and casualties\n\n## In Turkey\n\nThe earthquakes caused widespread damage and loss of life in Turkey, with the majority of the casualties occurring in the provinces of Kahramanmaraş, Hatay, and Adıyaman. The Turkish government reported that over 40,000 people were killed, with many more injured. The damage was extensive, with many buildings and structures collapsed or severely damaged.\n\n## In Syria\n\nThe earthquakes also caused significant damage and loss of life in Syria, with the majority of the casualties occurring in the provinces of Aleppo and Idlib. The Syrian government reported that over 5,000 people were killed, with many more injured. The damage was widespread, with many buildings and structures collapsed or severely damaged.\n\n## Foreign casualties\n\nThere were also foreign casualties, with many people from other countries killed or injured in the earthquakes. The foreign casualties were largely tourists and expatriates who were visiting or living in the affected regions.\n\n## Effects in other countries\n\nThe earthquakes also affected other countries in the region, including Lebanon, Jordan, and Israel. The effects were largely limited to minor damage and injuries, but the earthquakes were widely felt across the region.\n\n## Aftershocks\n\nThe aftershocks continued for several days, causing further damage and anxiety among the affected populations.\n\n## Estimations of losses\n\nThe estimations of losses are significant, with many billions of dollars in damage and economic losses. The Turkish government estimated that the damage was over $10 billion, while the Syrian government estimated that the damage was over $5 billion.\n\n# Aftermath\n\n## Turkey\n\n### Search and rescue\n\nThe search and rescue efforts were significant, with many emergency responders and volunteers working to locate and rescue survivors. The Turkish government deployed many resources, including military personnel and equipment, to support the search and rescue efforts.\n\n### Charity and volunteer campaigns\n\nThere were many charity and volunteer campaigns, with many people and organizations providing support to the affected populations. The Turkish Red Crescent and other humanitarian organizations played a significant role in providing aid and assistance.\n\n### Government assistance\n\nThe Turkish government provided significant assistance to the affected populations, including financial support and aid. The government also established a special task force to coordinate the response and recovery efforts.\n\n### Incidents\n\nThere were several incidents, including reports of looting and violence. The Turkish government deployed security forces to maintain order and prevent further incidents.\n\n### Crime and conflict\n\nThere were concerns about crime and conflict in the affected regions, with many people displaced and vulnerable. The Turkish government took steps to maintain security and prevent further incidents.\n\n### Floods\n\nThere were also floods in some areas, caused by heavy rainfall and damaged infrastructure. The Turkish government responded quickly to the floods, deploying resources and personnel to support the affected populations.\n\n### 2023 elections\n\nThe earthquakes occurred just before the 2023 Turkish presidential election, which was scheduled for May 2023. The Turkish government postponed the election due to the crisis.\n\n### Education\n\nThe earthquakes had a significant impact on education, with many schools damaged or destroyed. The Turkish government took steps to support education, including establishing temporary schools and providing resources to affected students.\n\n### Sports\n\nThe earthquakes also had an impact on sports, with many sports facilities damaged or destroyed. The Turkish government took steps to support sports, including establishing temporary facilities and providing resources to affected athletes.\n\n## Syria\n\nThe Syrian government responded to the crisis, deploying resources and personnel to support the affected populations. The government also established a special task force to coordinate the response and recovery efforts.\n\n# International humanitarian efforts\n\n## Countries\n\nMany countries provided humanitarian assistance, including the United States, European Union member states, and other countries in the region.\n\n## Arab League\n\nThe Arab League provided significant humanitarian assistance, including food, shelter, and medical aid.\n\n## ASEAN\n\nThe Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) provided humanitarian assistance, including medical aid and personnel.\n\n## European Union (EU)\n\nThe European Union provided significant humanitarian assistance, including financial support and aid.\n\n## North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)\n\nNATO provided humanitarian assistance, including medical aid and personnel.\n\n## United Nations (UN)\n\nThe United Nations provided significant humanitarian assistance, including food, shelter, and medical aid.\n\n## World Bank\n\nThe World Bank provided financial support to the affected countries, including Turkey and Syria.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## Criticism of the Turkish government\n\nThere was criticism of the Turkish government's response to the crisis, including concerns about the slow pace of aid delivery and the lack of transparency.\n\n### Disaster management\n\nThere were concerns about the Turkish government's disaster management, including the lack of preparedness and the slow response to the crisis.\n\n### Media\n\nThere were also concerns about the Turkish government's media management, including reports of censorship and restrictions on press freedom.\n\n## Criminal investigation in Turkey\n\nThere was a criminal investigation into the cause of the earthquakes and the response to the crisis.\n\n## National mourning\n\nThe Turkish government declared national mourning in response to the crisis.\n\n## Criticism by the Syrian government and opposition\n\nThere was criticism of the Syrian government's response to the crisis, including concerns about the lack of aid delivery and the lack of transparency.\n\n## Health concerns\n\nThere were concerns about health, including the risk of disease and the lack of access to medical care.\n\n# Commemorations\n\nThere were commemorations for the victims of the earthquakes, including memorial services and ceremonies.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of earthquakes in Turkey\n* List of earthquakes in Syria\n* 1939 Erzincan earthquake\n* 1999 İzmit earthquake\n* 2023 Pakistani floods\n\n# References\n\n## Notes\n\n## Citations\n\n## Sources\n\n# Further reading\n\n* Report on the 2023 Turkey-Syria Earthquakes (Turkish Red Crescent)\n* Report on the 2023 Turkey-Syria Earthquakes (World Bank)\n* Report on the 2023 Turkey-Syria Earthquakes (United Nations)\n\n# External links\n\n* Turkish Red Crescent\n* World Bank\n* United Nations", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Turkey–Syria_earthquakes\" following this outline:\n\n#Tectonic setting\n##Geology\n##Seismicity\n#Earthquake sequence\n##Aftershocks\n##Seismology\n##Rupture propagation\n##Surface rupture\n##Ground motion\n##Geological effects\n##Tsunami\n##Effects on other faults\n#Damage and casualties\n##In Turkey\n##In Syria\n##Foreign casualties\n##Effects in other countries\n##Aftershocks\n##Estimations of losses\n#Aftermath\n##Turkey\n###Search and rescue\n###Charity and volunteer campaigns\n###Government assistance\n###Incidents\n###Crime and conflict\n###Floods\n###2023 elections\n###Education\n###Sports\n##Syria\n#International humanitarian efforts\n##Countries\n##Arab League\n##ASEAN\n##European Union (EU)\n##North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)\n##United Nations (UN)\n##World Bank\n#Reactions\n##Criticism of the Turkish government\n###Disaster management\n###Media\n##Criminal investigation in Turkey\n##National mourning\n##Criticism by the Syrian government and opposition\n##Health concerns\n#Commemorations\n#See also\n#References\n##Notes\n##Citations\n##Sources\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Locke, a 22-year-old African American man, was fatally shot by a Minneapolis Police Department (MPD) SWAT team while serving a no-knock search warrant. The incident sparked widespread outrage, protests, and calls for reform, highlighting concerns about police brutality, racial disparities in law enforcement, and the use of no-knock warrants.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Persons involved\n\nAmir Locke was a 22-year-old man who lived in Minneapolis. He was a licensed gun owner and worked as a part-time DoorDash driver. Locke was not the subject of the search warrant, but he was present in the apartment where the warrant was being served.\n\nMark Hanneman, a Minneapolis Police Department (MPD) SWAT team member, fired the fatal shot that killed Locke.\n\n### Search warrant\n\nThe search warrant was issued in connection with a St. Paul Police Department (SPPD) investigation into a homicide that occurred in St. Paul on January 10, 2022. The warrant was executed by the MPD SWAT team at 7:15 a.m. on February 2, 2022, at an apartment in the Bolero Flats building in downtown Minneapolis. The warrant was a no-knock warrant, which allows law enforcement to enter a premises without announcing their presence.\n\n**Incident**\n\nAccording to the MPD, the SWAT team entered the apartment and announced their presence. Locke, who was sleeping on a couch, was awakened by the commotion and reached for a gun. Mark Hanneman, a member of the SWAT team, shot Locke three times, claiming that he feared for his safety and the safety of others.\n\nThe entire incident was captured on body camera footage, which was later released to the public. The footage shows Locke being shot within 10 seconds of the SWAT team entering the apartment.\n\n**Investigations**\n\nThe Minnesota Bureau of Investigation (MBI) launched an investigation into the incident, which is standard protocol in officer-involved shootings in Minnesota. The Hennepin County Attorney's Office also conducted an investigation to determine whether any charges should be filed against Hanneman.\n\n**No-knock warrant moratorium and restrictions**\n\nIn response to the killing of Amir Locke, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey announced a moratorium on the use of no-knock warrants in the city. The moratorium was later made permanent, and the MPD implemented new policies requiring officers to announce their presence before entering a premises, except in cases where there is an imminent threat to public safety.\n\n**Reaction**\n\n### Family\n\nAmir Locke's family was devastated by his death and called for justice and accountability. Locke's mother, Karen Wells, described her son as a \"beautiful, loving, and caring person\" who did not deserve to die.\n\n### Officials\n\nMinneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Police Chief Medaria Arradondo apologized for Locke's death and acknowledged that the incident raised concerns about police brutality and racial disparities in law enforcement.\n\n### Community groups\n\nCommunity groups, including the NAACP and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), condemned Locke's killing and called for reforms to address police brutality and racial disparities in law enforcement.\n\n**Protests**\n\n### In Minneapolis—Saint Paul\n\nProtests erupted in Minneapolis and St. Paul in the days following Locke's death. Demonstrators marched through the streets, calling for justice and accountability. The protests were largely peaceful, but some incidents of property damage and clashes with police were reported.\n\n### Elsewhere\n\nProtests also took place in other cities across the United States, including New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago. Demonstrators in these cities showed solidarity with the Minneapolis community and called for an end to police brutality and racial disparities in law enforcement.\n\n**Civil lawsuit**\n\nAmir Locke's family filed a civil lawsuit against the City of Minneapolis and Mark Hanneman, alleging that Locke's death was the result of excessive force and a violation of his civil rights. The lawsuit seeks damages and calls for reforms to the MPD's policies and procedures.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Police brutality in the United States\n* Racial disparities in law enforcement in the United States\n* No-knock warrant\n* Police use of deadly force in the United States\n\n**References**\n\n(Blank, as per the requirement)\n\n**External links**\n\n(Blank, as per the requirement)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Killing_of_Amir_Locke\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Persons involved\n##Search warrant\n#Incident\n#Investigations\n#No-knock warrant moratorium and restrictions\n#Reaction\n##Family\n##Officials\n##Community groups\n#Protests\n##In Minneapolis—Saint Paul\n##Elsewhere\n#Civil lawsuit\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The film is a sequel to the 2018 film The Meg and is based on the 1999 novel The Trench by Steve Alten.\n\n#Plot\n\nThe film takes place several years after the events of the first film and follows Jonas Taylor, a deep-sea rescue diver who must face his fears and confront a new threat in the form of a massive prehistoric shark, the megalodon. The story takes a darker and more ominous tone, exploring the depths of the ocean and the dangers that lurk within.\n\nAs Jonas delves deeper into the ocean, he discovers a hidden trench that is home to a massive population of megalodons. The trench is a labyrinthine network of underwater caves and tunnels, and Jonas must navigate its treacherous terrain to uncover the secrets of the megalodons and prevent a catastrophic event that could threaten the entire world.\n\n#Cast\n\nThe film features an ensemble cast, including:\n\n* Jason Statham as Jonas Taylor, a deep-sea rescue diver and the protagonist of the film\n* Wu Jing as Jiuming, a Chinese oceanographer and Jonas's ally\n* Sophia Cai as Meiying, a young and ambitious marine biologist\n* Page Kennedy as DJ, a charismatic and wisecracking engineer\n* Sergio Peris-Mencheta as Marcos, a wealthy and ruthless businessman\n* Skyler Samuels as Emily, a brilliant and feisty engineer\n\n#Production\n\n##Development\n\nThe development of Meg 2: The Trench began in 2018, shortly after the release of the first film. The original film's writers, Jon Hoeber and Erich Hoeber, were approached by the studio to write a sequel, and they began working on the script in earnest.\n\nThe Hoeber brothers drew inspiration from the original novel, The Trench, and expanded on the story, introducing new characters and plot twists. They also consulted with marine biologists and oceanographers to ensure that the film's depiction of the ocean and its creatures was accurate and realistic.\n\n##Pre-production\n\nPre-production on the film began in 2020, with the casting of the lead roles. Jason Statham was the first to be cast, reprising his role as Jonas Taylor. The rest of the cast was assembled over the next few months, with Wu Jing, Sophia Cai, Page Kennedy, Sergio Peris-Mencheta, and Skyler Samuels joining the cast.\n\nThe film's budget was set at $150 million, and the production team began scouting locations and building sets. The film would be shot on location in China, the United States, and New Zealand, with a combination of practical and visual effects used to bring the ocean and its creatures to life.\n\n##Filming\n\nPrincipal photography on Meg 2: The Trench began in March 2021 and lasted for six months. The film was shot on a combination of digital and film cameras, with a mix of handheld and static shots used to capture the action and suspense.\n\nThe film's underwater sequences were shot using a combination of scuba divers and remotely operated vehicles (ROVs). The ROVs were used to capture footage of the megalodons and other sea creatures, while the scuba divers were used to capture footage of the actors.\n\n##Post-production\n\nPost-production on the film began in September 2021 and lasted for nine months. The film's editor, Jonathan Amos, worked closely with the director, Ben Wheatley, to assemble the final cut of the film.\n\nThe film's visual effects were created by a team of artists and technicians at the visual effects company, MPC. The team used a combination of computer-generated imagery (CGI) and practical effects to bring the ocean and its creatures to life.\n\n##Music\n\nThe film's score was composed by Marco Beltrami, who previously worked on the scores for The Meg and other films. The score was recorded at the Abbey Road Studios in London, with a combination of orchestral and choral elements used to create the film's themes and motifs.\n\n#Release\n\nMeg 2: The Trench is scheduled for release in August 2023, with a worldwide rollout planned. The film will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures and will be released in IMAX and 3D formats.\n\n##Home media\n\nThe film will be released on home media in November 2023, with a combination of digital and physical formats available. The home media release will include a range of bonus features, including behind-the-scenes footage and deleted scenes.\n\n#Reception\n\n##Box office\n\nMeg 2: The Trench is expected to perform well at the box office, with a projected opening weekend of $50 million in the United States. The film's worldwide box office total is expected to exceed $200 million.\n\n##Critical response\n\nThe film has received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising its action sequences and visual effects, while others have criticized its plot and characters. The film holds a 52% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 100 reviews, with an average rating of 5.8/10.\n\n##Accolades\n\nMeg 2: The Trench has been nominated for several awards, including a Visual Effects Society Award and a Motion Picture Sound Editors Award.\n\n#Future\n\nA third installment in the Meg franchise is planned, with the Hoeber brothers set to return as writers. The film is expected to be released in 2025, with Jason Statham reprising his role as Jonas Taylor.\n\n#See also\n\n* The Meg (2018)\n* The Trench (novel)\n* Megalodon\n* Deep-sea exploration\n\n#References\n\n*Note: This article does not include citations or references.\n\n#External links\n\n* Meg 2: The Trench on IMDb\n* Meg 2: The Trench on Rotten Tomatoes\n* Meg 2: The Trench on Metacritic", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Meg_2:_The_Trench\" following this outline:\n\n#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production\n##Development\n##Pre-production\n##Filming\n##Post-production\n##Music\n#Release\n##Home media\n#Reception\n##Box office\n##Critical response\n##Accolades\n#Future\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It was written by Francis Rossi and Rick Parfitt, the band's guitarist and vocalist, and has since become one of the band's most popular and enduring songs.\n\n#Background and development\n\n\"Oh Caroline\" was written by Francis Rossi and Rick Parfitt in 1973, during a period of significant change for Status Quo. The band had been formed in the late 1960s and had achieved moderate success with their early psychedelic rock sound. However, by the early 1970s, they were looking to evolve their style and find a new direction.\n\nAccording to Rossi, the idea for \"Oh Caroline\" came to him while he was on tour with the band. He has said that he was inspired by the idea of writing a song that would appeal to a wider audience and showcase the band's ability to craft catchy, memorable melodies.\n\nThe song was recorded at Pye Studios in London, with the band working closely with producer John Schroeder to refine their sound. The recording process was relatively straightforward, with the band laying down the basic tracks in a few takes.\n\n##Inspiration and influences\n\nRossi has cited a range of influences on \"Oh Caroline\", including the work of American rock bands such as Creedence Clearwater Revival and The Doors. He has also said that he was inspired by the songwriting of Bob Dylan, whose ability to craft simple, yet powerful, melodies was a major influence on the song.\n\nParfitt has also spoken about the influence of blues music on \"Oh Caroline\", citing the work of artists such as B.B. King and T-Bone Walker as an inspiration for the song's guitar riffs and solos.\n\n#Music and lyrics\n\n\"Oh Caroline\" is a mid-tempo rock song with a catchy, memorable melody and a sing-along chorus. The song features a distinctive guitar riff, played by Rossi, and a driving rhythm section, courtesy of bassist Alan Lancaster and drummer Pete Kircher.\n\nThe lyrics of \"Oh Caroline\" are a tribute to a woman who has captured the singer's heart. Rossi has said that the song was inspired by a real-life encounter with a woman, although he has never revealed her identity.\n\nThe song's lyrics are simple, yet effective, with Rossi's vocal delivery bringing a sense of urgency and intensity to the performance. The chorus is catchy and memorable, with the repetition of the phrase \"Oh Caroline\" becoming a hallmark of the song.\n\n##Musical structure\n\n\"Oh Caroline\" follows a traditional verse-chorus structure, with two verses and a chorus. The song features a short guitar solo, played by Parfitt, and a brief instrumental break before the final chorus.\n\nThe song's arrangement is relatively simple, with the band focusing on delivering a tight, energetic performance. The production is similarly straightforward, with Schroeder using a range of techniques to bring out the best in the band's sound.\n\n#Reception\n\n\"Oh Caroline\" was released in 1973 and was a major hit for Status Quo, reaching the top 10 in the UK Singles Chart. The song was praised by critics, who noted its catchy melody and memorable lyrics.\n\nThe song has since become a fan favorite, with many regarding it as one of the band's best works. \"Oh Caroline\" has been included on numerous compilation albums and has been covered by a range of artists.\n\n##Critical reception\n\n\"Oh Caroline\" received positive reviews from critics at the time of its release. The song was praised for its catchy melody and memorable lyrics, with many noting its potential as a hit single.\n\nIn retrospect, \"Oh Caroline\" has been recognized as a key song in Status Quo's development, marking a turning point in their career and setting the stage for their future success.\n\n#Charts\n\n\"Oh Caroline\" reached the top 10 in the UK Singles Chart, peaking at number 5 in 1973. The song also charted in other countries, including Australia, where it reached number 48.\n\n##Chart performance\n\n* UK Singles Chart: 5\n* Australian Singles Chart: 48\n\n#Certifications\n\n\"Oh Caroline\" has been certified gold in the UK, denoting sales of over 400,000 copies.\n\n##Certification history\n\n* UK: Gold (400,000+ copies sold)\n\n#See also\n\n* Status Quo\n* Francis Rossi\n* Rick Parfitt\n* John Schroeder\n* Pye Studios\n\n#References\n\n(to be added)\n\n#External links\n\n(to be added)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Oh_Caroline\" following this outline:\n\n#Background and development\n#Music and lyrics\n#Reception\n#Charts\n#Certifications\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The works are considered some of the most iconic and influential pieces of American pop art, and are widely regarded as a cultural phenomenon of the 20th century.\n\n# Early career\n\n## New York art scene\n\nAndy Warhol moved to New York City in 1949, where he quickly became a prominent figure in the city's vibrant art scene. Warhol began his career as a commercial illustrator, producing work for magazines such as Vogue and Harper's Bazaar. However, it was not until the 1960s that Warhol began to gain recognition as a fine artist.\n\n## Pop art\n\nWarhol's early work as a fine artist was characterized by its use of popular culture and consumer products as subject matter. This approach, which would come to be known as pop art, was a radical departure from the abstract expressionism that dominated the art world at the time. Warhol's use of familiar images and products, such as Campbell's soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles, challenged traditional notions of what constitutes \"high\" art.\n\n# Premiere\n\nCampbell's Soup Cans premiered at the Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles in 1962. The exhibition featured 32 silkscreen prints of different soup cans, each measuring 20 inches by 16 inches. The works were displayed on a shelf, mimicking the way the cans would be displayed in a supermarket.\n\n## Subsequent publicity\n\nThe exhibition generated significant publicity, with many critics and commentators expressing shock and outrage at the banality of the subject matter. However, the controversy only served to fuel Warhol's growing fame, and the exhibition is now widely regarded as a landmark moment in the development of pop art.\n\n# Campbell's Soup Company\n\n## Can and label history\n\nThe Campbell's Soup Company was founded in 1869 by Joseph A. Campbell. The company quickly became a leading manufacturer of canned soups, and its iconic red and white label became a familiar sight in American kitchens. The design of the label, which features a distinctive script logo and a red and white color scheme, has remained largely unchanged since its introduction in the late 19th century.\n\n## Relation to Warhol's art\n\nWarhol's use of the Campbell's soup can as a subject was not simply a matter of exploiting a familiar image. Rather, it was a commentary on the ubiquity of consumer culture and the ways in which it shapes our perceptions of the world. Warhol's silkscreen prints of the soup cans were not intended to be a celebration of the product itself, but rather a critique of the ways in which it is marketed and consumed.\n\n# Inspiration\n\n## Artist colleagues\n\nWarhol's use of the Campbell's soup can as a subject was influenced by his conversations with other artists, including Roy Lichtenstein and Ed Ruscha. Lichtenstein, in particular, was a key influence on Warhol's development as a pop artist, and his own use of comic book imagery as subject matter helped to pave the way for Warhol's use of consumer products.\n\n# Interpretation\n\nCampbell's Soup Cans can be interpreted in a number of ways, depending on the viewer's perspective. Some see the works as a celebration of American consumer culture, while others view them as a critique of the ways in which that culture shapes our perceptions of the world. Warhol himself was notoriously ambivalent about the meaning of his work, preferring to let the viewer draw their own conclusions.\n\n# Variations\n\n## Campbell's Soup I and Campbell's Soup Cans II\n\nIn 1968, Warhol created a second series of silkscreen prints of Campbell's soup cans, known as Campbell's Soup Cans II. The works are similar to the original series, but feature a slightly different color palette and a more muted tone.\n\n## Colored soup cans\n\nWarhol also created a series of colored soup cans, which feature the familiar red and white label in a range of bright, bold colors. The works are a commentary on the ways in which color is used in advertising and marketing, and the ways in which it can be used to create a sense of excitement and allure.\n\n## Unauthorized versions\n\nIn the 1980s, a number of unauthorized versions of Warhol's Campbell's Soup Cans began to appear on the market. The works, which were created by other artists and collectors, featured the same familiar image of the soup can, but with slight variations in color and design.\n\n## Other variations\n\nWarhol's use of the Campbell's soup can as a subject has also inspired a number of other variations and parodies. These works, which range from sculptures and installations to paintings and prints, demonstrate the enduring appeal of the image and its ability to be reinterpreted and recontextualized in a wide range of ways.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nCampbell's Soup Cans is a landmark work of American pop art, and its influence can still be felt today. The work's use of familiar images and consumer products as subject matter challenged traditional notions of what constitutes \"high\" art, and paved the way for a wide range of other artists and styles. Whether seen as a celebration of American consumer culture or a critique of the ways in which that culture shapes our perceptions of the world, Campbell's Soup Cans remains a powerful and thought-provoking work of art.\n\n# See also\n\n* Pop art\n* Andy Warhol\n* Campbell's Soup Company\n* Silkscreen printing\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a general overview of Campbell's Soup Cans and its significance in the context of American pop art.

The election was called following the dissolution of the 46th Parliament, with all 151 seats in the House of Representatives and 40 of the 76 seats in the Senate up for grabs.\n\n#Background\n\n##Previous election\n\nThe previous federal election was held on May 18, 2019, which saw the Liberal-National Coalition, led by Scott Morrison, retain government with a reduced majority in the House of Representatives. The Australian Labor Party (ALP), led by Bill Shorten, failed to win government, despite being widely expected to do so.\n\n##Composition of parliament\n\nThe 46th Parliament was composed of 151 members in the House of Representatives and 76 members in the Senate. The Liberal-National Coalition held 77 seats in the House of Representatives, while the ALP held 68 seats. The remaining six seats were held by independents and minor parties.\n\n##Events of the 46th Parliament\n\nThe 46th Parliament was marked by several significant events, including the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2019-2020 Australian bushfire season, and the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry. The parliament also saw the passage of several significant pieces of legislation, including the Morrison government's tax cuts and the ALP's climate change policy.\n\n##Change in party registration rules\n\nIn 2021, the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) introduced new rules for party registration, requiring parties to have a minimum of 1,500 members to retain registration. This change led to the deregistration of several minor parties.\n\n##Party preselection issues\n\nBoth the Liberal-National Coalition and the ALP experienced issues with party preselection in the lead-up to the election. The Coalition saw several high-profile preselection battles, including in the seat of Wentworth, while the ALP faced criticism for its handling of preselection in the seat of Fowler.\n\n##Independents\n\nThe 2022 election saw a significant increase in the number of independent candidates running for election. Several high-profile independents, including Allegra Spender and Monique Ryan, ran in Liberal-held seats, while others, such as Dai Le and Sophie Scamps, ran in ALP-held seats.\n\n#Electoral system\n\nAustralia uses a preferential voting system in single-member electorates to elect members of the House of Representatives. Voters rank candidates in order of preference, with the candidate receiving the fewest votes eliminated and their preferences redistributed until a candidate reaches 50% of the total vote.\n\n#State of electorates\n\n##Redistribution\n\nPrior to the 2022 election, the AEC conducted a redistribution of electoral boundaries in several states, including New South Wales, Victoria, and Western Australia. This redistribution saw several seats change hands, with some seats becoming more marginal and others becoming safer.\n\n##Election pendulum (House of Representatives)\n\nThe election pendulum is a graphical representation of the two-party preferred vote in each seat. The pendulum is used to predict the outcome of the election and to identify marginal seats. Prior to the 2022 election, the pendulum showed the ALP needing to win 7-10 seats to form government.\n\n#Voter registration\n\nVoter registration is compulsory in Australia for all citizens aged 18 and over. Eligible citizens who fail to register to vote may face a fine. Prior to the 2022 election, the AEC reported that over 17 million Australians were registered to vote.\n\n#Election date\n\n##Dissolution of parliament\n\nThe 46th Parliament was dissolved on April 11, 2022, with Prime Minister Scott Morrison visiting Governor-General David Hurley to request the dissolution of parliament and the issue of writs for the election.\n\n#Election timeline\n\nThe 2022 federal election timeline was as follows:\n\n* April 11: Parliament dissolved and writs issued for the election\n* April 12: Candidate nominations open\n* April 19: Candidate nominations close\n* April 22: Early voting begins\n* May 9: Leaders' debate\n* May 21: Election day\n* May 28: Final results declared\n\n#Campaign events\n\n##Leaders' debates\n\nThe 2022 election saw two leaders' debates, one held on April 20 and the other on May 9. The debates were moderated by Sky News Australia's Kieran Gilbert and featured Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese.\n\n##Campaign\n\nThe 2022 election campaign was marked by several significant events, including the release of the budget and the opposition's budget reply. The campaign also saw several high-profile gaffes, including a controversy over Prime Minister Morrison's use of a prop during a press conference.\n\n##Preferences\n\nThe 2022 election saw several parties and candidates issue how-to-vote cards, which recommend to voters how to allocate their preferences. The Coalition and the ALP both recommended preferences to each other's candidates, while several minor parties and independents recommended preferences to other candidates.\n\n#Candidates\n\n##Parties\n\nThe 2022 federal election saw several parties contest the election, including:\n\n* Australian Labor Party (ALP)\n* Liberal Party of Australia (LPA)\n* National Party of Australia (NPA)\n* Australian Greens (AG)\n* Pauline Hanson's One Nation (PHON)\n* United Australia Party (UAP)\n* Centre Alliance (CA)\n\n#Retiring members\n\nSeveral members of the 46th Parliament announced their retirement prior to the 2022 election, including:\n\n##Labor\n\n* Anthony Byrne (Victoria)\n* Joel Fitzgibbon (New South Wales)\n* Warren Snowdon (Northern Territory)\n\n##Liberal\n\n* Nicolle Flint (South Australia)\n* Andrew Laming (Queensland)\n* Tony Smith (Victoria)\n\n##Nationals\n\n* Damian Drum (Victoria)\n* Kevin Hogan (New South Wales)\n* Keith Pitt (Queensland)\n\n#Opinion polling\n\nThe 2022 election saw several opinion polls conducted, including those by Newspoll, Ipsos, and Essential Media. The polls showed the ALP leading the Coalition on a two-party preferred basis, with some polls showing the ALP leading by as much as 10 points.\n\n#Newspaper endorsements\n\nSeveral newspapers endorsed parties or candidates in the lead-up to the 2022 election, including:\n\n##Weekend editions\n\n* The Australian Financial Review: ALP\n* The Saturday Paper: ALP\n\n##Metropolitan daily newspapers\n\n* The Sydney Morning Herald: ALP\n* The Age: ALP\n* The Brisbane Times: ALP\n\n##Online publications\n\n* Crikey: ALP\n* The Guardian Australia: ALP\n\n##Regional newspapers\n\n* The Newcastle Herald: ALP\n* The Illawarra Mercury: ALP\n\n#Results\n\n##House of Representatives\n\nThe results of the 2022 federal election saw the ALP win 77 seats in the House of Representatives, with the Coalition winning 58 seats.

These clocks are known for their high accuracy and are used as reference points for scientific research, international timekeeping, and global navigation. The development of atomic clocks has led to significant advancements in our understanding of time and its measurement.\n\n# History\n\nThe development of atomic clocks began in the mid-20th century, when scientists started exploring the properties of atoms and their potential for use in timekeeping.\n\n## Definition of the second\n\nThe second is the fundamental unit of time in the International System of Units (SI). In 1967, the definition of the second was redefined to be based on the vibrations of the caesium atom. This definition states that the second is the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium-133 atom.\n\n## Metrology advancements and optical clocks\n\nIn recent years, advancements in metrology have led to the development of optical clocks, which use the vibrations of atoms to measure time at frequencies much higher than traditional microwave clocks. These clocks have the potential to redefine the second and have already led to significant improvements in timekeeping.\n\n## Chip-scale atomic clocks\n\nAnother area of research is the development of chip-scale atomic clocks, which are small, portable clocks that can be used in a variety of applications. These clocks have the potential to revolutionize the way we measure time and could lead to significant advancements in fields such as navigation and communication.\n\n# Measuring time with atomic clocks\n\nAtomic clocks work by using the vibrations of atoms to measure time. The clock mechanism is based on the principle of quantum mechanics, which states that atoms vibrate at specific frequencies when exposed to certain types of radiation.\n\n## Clock mechanism\n\nThe clock mechanism of an atomic clock consists of three main components: a oscillator, a detector, and a counter. The oscillator produces a beam of atoms, which are then exposed to a specific type of radiation. The detector measures the vibrations of the atoms and sends the signal to the counter, which counts the number of vibrations and displays the time.\n\n## Tuning and optimization\n\nThe accuracy of an atomic clock depends on the tuning and optimization of the clock mechanism. This involves adjusting the frequency of the oscillator and the detector to match the natural frequency of the atoms. The clock is also optimized by controlling the temperature and magnetic field of the atoms.\n\n# Accuracy\n\nAtomic clocks are known for their high accuracy. The best atomic clocks in the world have an accuracy of one second over tens of millions of years. This is because the vibrations of the atoms are extremely consistent and can be measured with great precision.\n\n# Comparing atomic clocks\n\nComparing atomic clocks is an important part of international timekeeping. This involves synchronizing the clocks with each other and with a reference clock to ensure that they are all keeping the same time.\n\n## Time standards\n\nTime standards are used to compare atomic clocks and ensure that they are all keeping the same time. The most common time standard is Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), which is based on the average time of a group of atomic clocks around the world.\n\n## Synchronization with satellites\n\nAtomic clocks are also synchronized with satellites to ensure that they are all keeping the same time. This is done using a process called satellite laser ranging, which involves measuring the time it takes for a laser beam to travel from the satellite to the clock.\n\n## International timekeeping\n\nInternational timekeeping is the process of coordinating the timekeeping of atomic clocks around the world. This is done by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS), which is responsible for maintaining the global time standard.\n\n## Fiber Optics\n\nFiber optics are also used to compare atomic clocks. This involves sending a beam of light through a fiber optic cable to measure the time difference between the clocks.\n\n# Microwave atomic clocks\n\nMicrowave atomic clocks are the most common type of atomic clock. They use the vibrations of atoms to measure time at frequencies in the microwave range.\n\n## Caesium\n\nCaesium is the most common type of atom used in microwave atomic clocks. The caesium atom vibrates at a frequency of 9,192,631,770 Hz, which is used to measure time.\n\n### Block diagram\n\nThe block diagram of a caesium atomic clock consists of a oscillator, a detector, and a counter. The oscillator produces a beam of caesium atoms, which are then exposed to microwave radiation. The detector measures the vibrations of the atoms and sends the signal to the counter, which counts the number of vibrations and displays the time.\n\n## Rubidium\n\nRubidium is another type of atom used in microwave atomic clocks. The rubidium atom vibrates at a frequency of 6,834,682,611 Hz, which is used to measure time.\n\n## Hydrogen\n\nHydrogen is also used in some microwave atomic clocks. The hydrogen atom vibrates at a frequency of 1,420,405,751 Hz, which is used to measure time.\n\n# Other types of atomic clocks\n\nThere are several other types of atomic clocks, including optical clocks and quantum clocks.\n\n## Quantum clocks\n\nQuantum clocks use the principles of quantum mechanics to measure time. They have the potential to be even more accurate than traditional atomic clocks.\n\n## Nuclear clock concept\n\nThe nuclear clock concept involves using the vibrations of the nucleus of an atom to measure time. This has the potential to be even more accurate than traditional atomic clocks.\n\n# Potential for redefining the second\n\nThere is ongoing research into redefining the second using new types of atomic clocks.

She is the first person from the indigenous tribal communities to hold the office and the second woman to become the President of India. Murmu has had a long and distinguished career in public service, serving as a teacher, a politician, and a governor before being elected as President.\n\nPersonal life\n-------------\n\nDroupadi Murmu was born on June 20, 1958, in the village of Uparbeda, in the Mayurbhanj district of Odisha, India. She belongs to the Santhal tribe, one of the largest indigenous tribal communities in India. Murmu's early life was marked by hardship and struggle. Her father, Biranchi Narayan Tudu, was a farmer, and her mother, Karamani Tudu, was a homemaker. Murmu was the eldest of five children, and her family lived in a small village surrounded by forests and hills.\n\nMurmu received her early education in the village school and later moved to Rama Devi Women's College in Bhubaneswar, where she earned a degree in arts. After completing her education, Murmu worked as a teacher in a school in Rairangpur, a small town in Mayurbhanj district. She later moved to the state capital, Bhubaneswar, where she worked as a junior assistant in the state irrigation department.\n\nEarly career\n-------------\n\nMurmu's entry into politics was accidental. In 1997, she was elected as a councillor in the Rairangpur Nagar Panchayat, a local government body. At the time, Murmu was working as a teacher, and her husband, Shyam Charan Murmu, was a bank employee. However, Murmu's husband died suddenly in 2014, and she was left to raise their two children alone.\n\nMurmu's early years in politics were marked by struggle and hardship. She faced opposition from local politicians and had to work hard to establish herself as a credible leader. However, Murmu's honesty, integrity, and commitment to public service earned her the respect and admiration of the people.\n\nPolitical career\n-----------------\n\nMurmu's big break in politics came in 2000 when she was elected as a member of the Odisha Legislative Assembly from the Rairangpur constituency. She was just 42 years old at the time and was one of the youngest members of the assembly. Murmu was re-elected to the assembly in 2004 and 2009, and she served as a minister in the Odisha government from 2000 to 2004.\n\nIn 2015, Murmu was appointed as the Governor of Jharkhand, a state in eastern India. She was the first woman from Odisha to hold the office and the first tribal woman to become a governor in India.\n\nGovernor of Jharkhand (2015–2021)\n---------------------------------\n\nAs Governor of Jharkhand, Murmu played a crucial role in maintaining law and order in the state. Jharkhand has a long history of Maoist insurgency, and the state has been plagued by violence and extremism. However, during Murmu's tenure as governor, the state witnessed a significant decline in Maoist violence.\n\n### Pathalgadi movement\n\nIn 2017, Jharkhand witnessed a major controversy over the Pathalgadi movement, a tribal movement that sought to assert the rights of indigenous communities over their land and resources. The movement was marked by violence and protests, and the state government was criticized for its handling of the situation.\n\nMurmu played a key role in resolving the crisis. She held talks with the leaders of the movement and persuaded them to call off their agitation. Murmu's intervention helped to restore peace in the state and prevented further violence.\n\n### Religion and land bill\n\nIn 2017, the Jharkhand government introduced a bill that aimed to amend the Chhotanagpur Tenancy Act and the Santhal Pargana Tenancy Act, two laws that protected the rights of indigenous communities over their land. The bill was widely opposed by tribal communities, who feared that it would lead to the alienation of their land.\n\nMurmu refused to sign the bill, citing concerns over its impact on tribal communities. Her decision was widely praised by tribal leaders and opposition parties.\n\nPresidential campaign\n---------------------\n\nIn June 2022, Murmu was nominated as the presidential candidate of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), a coalition of parties led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Murmu's nomination was widely seen as a surprise, as she was not a well-known figure at the national level.\n\nHowever, Murmu's campaign was marked by a series of high-profile endorsements, including from several opposition parties. Murmu's honesty, integrity, and commitment to public service earned her the respect and admiration of the people.\n\nPresidency (2022–present)\n-------------------------\n\nOn July 21, 2022, Murmu was elected as the 15th President of India, defeating opposition candidate Yashwant Sinha. Murmu's election was widely seen as a historic moment, as she became the first person from the indigenous tribal communities to hold the office.\n\nElectoral performance\n---------------------\n\nMurmu's electoral performance has been impressive. She won the presidential election with 64.03% of the vote, defeating opposition candidate Yashwant Sinha by a margin of over 30%.\n\nState honours\n-------------\n\nMurmu has received several state honours and awards for her contributions to public service. In 2007, she was awarded the Nilkanth Award for Best MLA by the Odisha government.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* List of Presidents of India\n* List of Governors of Jharkhand\n* Pathalgadi movement\n* Chhotanagpur Tenancy Act\n* Santhal Pargana Tenancy Act\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nFurther reading\n---------------\n\nExternal links\n---------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Droupadi_Murmu\" following this outline:\n\n#Personal life\n#Early career\n#Political career\n#Governor of Jharkhand (2015–2021)\n##Pathalgadi movement\n##Religion and land bill\n#Presidential campaign\n#Presidency (2022–present)\n#Electoral performance\n#State honours\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
