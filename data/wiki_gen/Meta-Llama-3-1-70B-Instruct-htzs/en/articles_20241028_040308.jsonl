It is the longest-running noontime variety show in the Philippines, airing on television for over 43 years. The show features a mix of entertainment, comedy, public service, and social awareness, making it a staple in Filipino television.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\n### RPN (1979–1989)\n\nEat Bulaga! premiered on July 30, 1979, on RPN as a noontime variety show created by Television and Production Exponents Inc.

During its early years, the show focused on comedy sketches, musical numbers, and public service segments.\n\n### ABS-CBN (1989–1995)\n\nIn 1989, Eat Bulaga! transferred to ABS-CBN, where it continued to air as a noontime variety show.

However, the show's popularity began to decline during this period.\n\n### GMA Network (1995–2024)\n\nIn 1995, Eat Bulaga! moved to GMA Network, where it experienced a resurgence in popularity. The show's hosts, including Tito Sotto, Vic Sotto, and Joey de Leon, became household names. The show's format was revamped, with the addition of new segments and games. Eat Bulaga! became a ratings success, and it remained as one of the top-rated noontime variety shows in the Philippines.\n\n### TVJ - TAPE Inc. conflict (2023–2024)\n\nIn 2023, a conflict arose between the show's hosts, collectively known as TVJ (Tito, Vic, and Joey), and TAPE Inc. over the ownership of the Eat Bulaga! trademark. The conflict led to a split between the two parties, with TVJ launching a new show called E.A.T. and TAPE Inc. continuing to air Eat Bulaga! with a new set of hosts.\n\n#### E.A.T. and TAPE's Eat Bulaga!\n\nE.A.T.

Meanwhile, TAPE Inc. continued to air Eat Bulaga! with a new set of hosts, including new-comers and veteran television personalities.\n\n#### Eat Bulaga! trademark battle: TVJ emerges victorious\n\nIn 2024, the Intellectual Property Office of the Philippines ruled in favor of TVJ, granting them ownership of the Eat Bulaga! trademark. The ruling effectively allowed TVJ to use the Eat Bulaga! name, and the show was subsequently renamed Eat Bulaga!.\n\n### TV5 and RPTV (since 2024)\n\nIn 2024, Eat Bulaga! transferred to TV5 and RPTV, where it continues to air as a noontime variety show.

The term \"anti-Zionism\" can be applied to individuals, groups, and ideologies that reject the idea of a Jewish homeland, question the legitimacy of the State of Israel, or criticize the actions of the Israeli government. This article will explore the history and development of anti-Zionism, from its early roots to its current forms and manifestations.\n\nAnti-Zionism before 1948\n----------------------\n\n### Early Jewish anti-Zionism\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many Jewish leaders and intellectuals opposed the idea of Zionism. Some argued that a Jewish state would be incompatible with the principles of socialism, while others believed that it would lead to the segregation of Jewish communities from the rest of society. Theodor Herzl, the founder of modern Zionism, faced significant opposition from within the Jewish community, with some critics labeling his ideas as \"utopian\" or \"dangerous.\"\n\n### Early Arab anti-Zionism\n\nArab opposition to Zionism began to emerge in the early 20th century, as the Zionist movement gained momentum. Many Arabs saw Zionism as a threat to their own national aspirations and feared that a Jewish state would lead to the displacement of Arab populations. The 1917 Balfour Declaration, which expressed British support for the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine, sparked widespread protests and opposition across the Arab world.\n\n### Reactions to the Balfour Declaration\n\nThe Balfour Declaration was met with fierce opposition from Arab leaders and intellectuals, who saw it as a betrayal of Arab interests and a threat to their own national aspirations. The declaration sparked widespread protests and demonstrations across the Arab world, with many calling for the rejection of British rule and the establishment of an independent Arab state.\n\n### Anti-Zionism in the 1920s–1930s\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, anti-Zionism became a major force in Arab politics, with many leaders and intellectuals advocating for the rejection of Zionism and the establishment of an independent Arab state. The 1920 Nebi Musa riots, which broke out in Jerusalem, marked a turning point in Arab-Jewish relations, with many Arabs seeing Zionism as a direct threat to their own national aspirations.\n\n### The Biltmore programme and its anti-Zionism fall-out\n\nIn 1942, the Zionist movement adopted the Biltmore programme, which called for the establishment of a Jewish commonwealth in Palestine. The programme sparked widespread opposition from Arab leaders and intellectuals, who saw it as a direct threat to their own national aspirations. The programme also sparked opposition from within the Jewish community, with some critics arguing that it was too extreme and would lead to conflict with the Arab population.\n\n### Religious\n\nReligious anti-Zionism has been a significant force in both Jewish and Muslim communities. Some Jewish leaders and intellectuals have argued that Zionism is incompatible with Jewish tradition and that the establishment of a Jewish state is a form of idolatry. In the Muslim world, some leaders and intellectuals have argued that Zionism is a form of colonialism and that the establishment of a Jewish state is a threat to Islamic values and principles.\n\nAnti-Zionism after World War II and the creation of Israel\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n### 1947–1948\n\nIn the aftermath of World War II, the Zionist movement gained significant momentum, with many Jews seeking to establish a homeland in Palestine. The 1947 UN Partition Plan, which called for the division of Palestine into Jewish and Arab states, was met with widespread opposition from Arab leaders and intellectuals, who saw it as a threat to their own national aspirations. The establishment of the State of Israel in 1948 sparked widespread conflict and opposition across the Arab world.\n\n### Soviet Union\n\nIn the aftermath of World War II, the Soviet Union emerged as a major opponent of Zionism, viewing it as a form of imperialism and a threat to Arab national aspirations. The Soviet Union provided significant support to Arab states, including Egypt and Syria, in their opposition to Israel.\n\n### Arab and Palestinian anti-Zionism\n\nArab and Palestinian anti-Zionism has been a significant force in the region, with many leaders and intellectuals advocating for the rejection of Zionism and the establishment of a Palestinian state. The 1967 Six-Day War, which resulted in Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, marked a turning point in Arab-Israeli relations, with many Arabs seeing Zionism as a direct threat to their own national aspirations.\n\n### Perception of Zionism as racism\n\nThe perception of Zionism as a form of racism has been a significant theme in anti-Zionist discourse. Many critics argue that Zionism is a form of apartheid, with Israel's treatment of Palestinian Arabs being compared to the treatment of black South Africans under apartheid.\n\n#### During the Cold War\n\nDuring the Cold War, anti-Zionism became a major force in international politics, with many countries and organizations opposing Israel's existence and viewing Zionism as a form of imperialism.\n\n#### After the Cold War\n\nIn the aftermath of the Cold War, anti-Zionism has continued to evolve, with many critics arguing that Zionism is a form of colonialism and that Israel's treatment of Palestinian Arabs is a form of apartheid.\n\n### Islamic perspectives\n\nIslamic perspectives on Zionism have been complex and varied, with some leaders and intellectuals viewing Zionism as a form of colonialism and others seeing it as a threat to Islamic values and principles.\n\n### Left-wing politics\n\nLeft-wing politics has been a significant force in anti-Zionist discourse, with many critics arguing that Zionism is a form of imperialism and that Israel's treatment of Palestinian Arabs is a form of apartheid.\n\n### Christian anti-Zionism\n\nChristian anti-Zionism has been a significant force in both Protestant and Catholic communities, with many leaders and intellectuals advocating for the rejection of Zionism and the establishment of a Palestinian state.\n\n#### Protestants\n\nProtestant anti-Zionism has been a significant force, with many leaders and intellectuals advocating for the rejection of Zionism and the establishment of a Palestinian state.\n\n#### Catholics\n\nCatholic anti-Zionism has been a significant force, with many leaders and intellectuals advocating for the rejection of Zionism and the establishment of a Palestinian state.\n\n### Haredi Judaism\n\nHaredi Judaism has been a significant force in anti-Zionist discourse, with many leaders and intellectuals arguing that Zionism is incompatible with Jewish tradition and that the establishment of a Jewish state is a form of idolatry.\n\nAllegations of antisemitism\n-------------------------\n\n### Jewish right to a state\n\nThe question of whether Jews have a right to a state has been a significant theme in anti-Zionist discourse, with many critics arguing that Zionism is a form of colonialism and that Israel's treatment of Palestinian Arabs is a form of apartheid.\n\n### Equating and correlating anti-Zionism with antisemitism\n\nSome critics have argued that anti-Zionism is a form of antisemitism, with many anti-Zionist activists and organizations being accused of promoting antisemitic views.\n\n### View that the two are not interlinked\n\nOthers have argued that anti-Zionism and antisemitism are not interlinked, with many anti-Zionist activists and organizations advocating for the rights of Palestinian Arabs and opposing Israel's treatment of them.\n\n### Shifting positions on the Zionist/Anti-Zionist spectrum\n\nThe Zionist/anti-Zionist spectrum has been complex and varied, with many individuals and organizations shifting their positions over time.\n\n### Far-right politics\n\nFar-right politics has been a significant force in anti-Zionist discourse, with many leaders and intellectuals advocating for the rejection of Zionism and the establishment of a white nationalist state.\n\n### Conspiracy theories\n\nConspiracy theories have been a significant theme in anti-Zionist discourse, with many critics arguing that Zionism is a form of colonialism and that Israel's treatment of Palestinian Arabs is a form of apartheid.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Zionism\n* Antisemitism\n* Israel-Palestine conflict\n* Palestinian nationalism\n* Arab nationalism\n\nNotes\n-----\n\n* This article is a general overview of

Born in 1978 in Odessa, Ukraine, Ovsyannikova worked for Channel One Russia, one of the country's most prominent state-owned television channels, before her public dissent.\n\n#Early life and career\n\nMarina Ovsyannikova was born in 1978 in Odessa, Ukraine, to a Ukrainian mother and a Russian father. She grew up in a multicultural family and moved to Russia at a young age. Ovsyannikova studied journalism at the Moscow State University and began her career in television as an intern at Channel One Russia. She quickly rose through the ranks, becoming an editor and eventually a producer for the channel's flagship news program, Vremya.\n\nDuring her tenure at Channel One, Ovsyannikova worked on various high-profile projects, including coverage of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi and the 2018 FIFA World Cup. She was known for her professionalism and attention to detail, earning the respect of her colleagues and superiors.\n\n#Anti-war protests\n\nOn March 14, 2022, Ovsyannikova made headlines around the world when she appeared on live television holding a sign that read \"NO WAR\" and \"Russians against war.\" The bold protest occurred during a broadcast of Vremya, and Ovsyannikova's message was seen by millions of viewers.\n\n##Pre-recorded message\n\nIn addition to her live protest, Ovsyannikova had also pre-recorded a video message in which she spoke out against the war in Ukraine and criticized the Russian government's propaganda efforts. In the video, she stated that she was ashamed of her country's actions and called on Russians to take a stand against the war.\n\nOvsyannikova's video message was released on social media and quickly went viral, with many praising her courage and conviction. The video was also translated into multiple languages, allowing it to reach a wider audience and further amplify its impact.\n\n##Reactions\n\nOvsyannikova's protest sparked a range of reactions, both within Russia and internationally. Many Russians praised her bravery and echoed her calls for an end to the war, while others criticized her for being unpatriotic and disloyal to the government.\n\nInternationally, Ovsyannikova was hailed as a hero and a symbol of resistance against the Russian government's authoritarianism. World leaders and human rights organizations praised her courage and condemned the Russian government's actions in Ukraine.\n\n##Persecutions and activism\n\nFollowing her protest, Ovsyannikova faced persecution and harassment from the Russian authorities. She was detained and questioned by police, and her social media accounts were suspended. Ovsyannikova's family also faced intimidation and threats, with her father reportedly being visited by security agents.\n\nDespite these challenges, Ovsyannikova continued to speak out against the war and advocate for human rights in Russia. She joined forces with other anti-war activists and organizations, using her platform to raise awareness and mobilize support for the cause.\n\n##Criticism\n\nWhile Ovsyannikova's protest was widely praised, some critics argued that her actions were too little, too late. They pointed out that she had worked for a state-owned television channel for many years, helping to disseminate the government's propaganda and lies.\n\nOthers criticized Ovsyannikova for her perceived privilege and elitism, arguing that she had benefited from her position in the media and had only spoken out when it was convenient for her.\n\n#Personal life\n\nOvsyannikova is married with two children. She has stated that her family has faced significant challenges and risks as a result of her activism, but that she is committed to continuing her work.\n\nIn an interview, Ovsyannikova spoke about the emotional toll of her experience, saying that she had faced significant stress and anxiety in the aftermath of her protest. However, she also expressed a sense of pride and purpose, stating that she had found a new sense of meaning in her life through her activism.\n\n#See also\n\n* 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* Anti-war movement\n* Human rights in Russia\n* Russian propaganda\n* State-owned media\n\n#Notes\n\n* This article is based on publicly available information and does not include any citations or references.\n\n#References\n\n* This article does not include any references.\n\n#Further reading\n\n* \"Marina Ovsyannikova: The Russian journalist who took a stand against the war\" (The Guardian)\n* \"Russia's anti-war movement: A glimmer of hope\" (The New York Times)\n* \"The propaganda machine: How Russia's state-owned media shapes public opinion\" (The Economist)\n\n#External links\n\n* Marina Ovsyannikova on Twitter\n* Marina Ovsyannikova on Facebook\n* Anti-war movement in Russia (BBC News)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Marina_Ovsyannikova\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and career\n#Anti-war protests\n##Pre-recorded message\n##Reactions\n##Persecutions and activism\n##Criticism\n#Personal life\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The DPR and LPR declared independence from Ukraine in 2014, following a period of unrest in the Donbass region. Since then, the international community has been divided on the question of whether to recognize these entities as independent states.\n\n# History\n\nThe Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic declared independence from Ukraine on April 7 and April 27, 2014, respectively. The declarations of independence were made in response to the Ukrainian government's decision to remove Viktor Yanukovych as President of Ukraine, which was seen as a coup by many in the Donbass region. The DPR and LPR were established with the support of Russia, which has been accused of providing military and economic aid to the separatist movements.\n\nIn the years following the declarations of independence, the DPR and LPR have established their own governments, military forces, and economic systems. However, they are not recognized as independent states by the international community, except for Russia, which recognized them as independent states on February 21, 2022.\n\n# Aftermath of Russian recognition\n\nRussia's recognition of the DPR and LPR as independent states has been widely condemned by the international community. The United States, the European Union, and other countries have imposed sanctions on Russia in response to its actions.

Rowling's full name is Joanne Kathleen Rowling. She was born on July 31, 1965, in Yate, Gloucestershire, England. She adopted the pen name J.K. Rowling for her writing career, using her initials instead of her full name.\n\n# Life and career\n\n## Early life and family\n\nRowling was born to Peter James Rowling and Anne Volant Rowling. Her father was a Rolls-Royce aircraft engineer, and her mother was a science technician. She has a younger sister, Dianne.

During her time at university, she developed a passion for writing and began to write stories in her spare time.\n\n## Inspiration and mother's death\n\nRowling's mother, Anne, was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1990, and Rowling became her primary caregiver.

Tolkien, Philip Pullman, and Ursula K. Le Guin. She has also been influenced by mythology and folklore, particularly in her depiction of magical creatures.\n\n# Style and themes\n\n## Style and allusions\n\nRowling's writing style is characterized by her use of descriptive language and her ability to create vivid characters and settings. She has also been praised for her use of allusions, particularly in her references to mythology and literature.\n\n## Themes\n\nRowling's work often explores themes of friendship, love, and the struggle between good and evil. She has also written about social issues, such as poverty, prejudice, and the impact of war on civilians.\n\n# Reception\n\n## Gender and social division\n\nRowling's work has been praised for its portrayal of strong female characters and its exploration of social issues, such as poverty and prejudice. However, some critics have argued that her work reinforces traditional gender roles and social divisions.\n\n## Religious reactions\n\nRowling's depiction of magic and the wizarding world has been criticized by some religious groups, who have accused her of promoting occultism and Satanism. However, Rowling has stated that her work is not intended to promote any particular religion or worldview.\n\n# Legacy\n\nRowling's work has had a significant impact on popular culture, inspiring a generation of readers and writers.

From the early days of the Russian Empire to the modern era, Russian cinema has made significant contributions to the world of film. This article provides an overview of the development of Russian cinema, from its early beginnings to the present day.\n\n# Cinema of the Russian Empire\n\nThe cinema of the Russian Empire began to take shape in the late 19th century, with the first film screenings taking place in 1896. The early years of Russian cinema were marked by experimentation and innovation, with filmmakers such as Vladimir Romashkov and Vasily Goncharov producing short films that showcased the country's natural beauty and cultural heritage.\n\nOne of the most notable filmmakers of the Russian Empire was Yakov Protasanov, who directed the 1913 film \"The Queen of Spades,\" based on the novella by Alexander Pushkin. The film was a critical and commercial success, and helped establish Protasanov as one of the leading figures of Russian cinema.\n\n# Cinema of the Soviet Union\n\nThe Russian Revolution of 1917 had a profound impact on the country's film industry. The new Soviet government recognized the potential of cinema as a tool for propaganda and education, and invested heavily in the development of the industry.\n\n## Early Soviet cinema (1917–1953)\n\nThe early years of Soviet cinema were marked by a focus on propaganda and ideological correctness. Filmmakers such as Sergei Eisenstein and Dziga Vertov produced films that promoted the ideals of socialism and communism, and helped to shape the country's cultural identity.\n\nOne of the most notable films of this period was Eisenstein's \"Battleship Potemkin,\" released in 1925. The film was a masterpiece of montage editing and told the story of the mutiny on the Battleship Potemkin during the Russian Revolution. It was a critical and commercial success, and helped to establish Eisenstein as one of the leading figures of Soviet cinema.\n\n## Late Soviet cinema (1953–1990)\n\nThe late Soviet period saw a relaxation of censorship and a growth in creative freedom for filmmakers. Directors such as Andrei Tarkovsky and Nikita Mikhalkov produced films that explored the complexities of Soviet life and culture.\n\nOne of the most notable films of this period was Tarkovsky's \"Andrei Rublev,\" released in 1966. The film was a biographical drama about the life of the famous Russian icon painter, and explored themes of art, faith, and creativity. It was a critical and commercial success, and helped to establish Tarkovsky as one of the leading figures of Soviet cinema.\n\n# New Russian cinema\n\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 had a profound impact on the Russian film industry. The new Russian government was forced to adapt to a market-based economy, and the industry faced significant challenges in terms of funding and distribution.\n\n## 1990s\n\nThe 1990s saw a growth in independent filmmaking in Russia, with directors such as Alexander Sokurov and Pavel Lungin producing films that explored the complexities of post-Soviet life and culture.\n\nOne of the most notable films of this period was Sokurov's \"The Days of the Eclipse,\" released in 1988. The film was a drama about a young doctor who becomes embroiled in a mystery in a remote Siberian village. It was a critical and commercial success, and helped to establish Sokurov as one of the leading figures of new Russian cinema.\n\n## 2000s\n\nThe 2000s saw a growth in mainstream filmmaking in Russia, with directors such as Timur Bekmambetov and Fyodor Bondarchuk producing films that explored the complexities of post-Soviet life and culture.\n\nOne of the most notable films of this period was Bekmambetov's \"Night Watch,\" released in 2004. The film was a supernatural thriller about a group of people who must protect Moscow from a group of vampires. It was a critical and commercial success, and helped to establish Bekmambetov as one of the leading figures of new Russian cinema.\n\n## 2010s\n\nThe 2010s saw a growth in international co-productions in Russia, with directors such as Andrey Zvyagintsev and Alexei German producing films that explored the complexities of post-Soviet life and culture.\n\nOne of the most notable films of this period was Zvyagintsev's \"Leviathan,\" released in 2014.

The case, which began in 2018, involves allegations of falsifying business records and other crimes related to Trump's dealings with adult film actress Stormy Daniels.\n\n# Background\n\n## Stormy Daniels–Donald Trump scandal\n\nIn 2006, Donald Trump had an affair with adult film actress Stormy Daniels. Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, arranged a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) with Daniels, which required her to keep the affair confidential in exchange for a payment of $130,000. The payment was made just before the 2016 presidential election.\n\n## Manhattan DA investigation and grand jury\n\nIn 2018, the Manhattan District Attorney's Office launched an investigation into Trump's dealings with Daniels, including the NDA and the payment. The investigation, led by District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr., also examined whether Trump's company, the Trump Organization, had falsified business records related to the payment.\n\nIn 2020, a grand jury was convened to investigate the allegations. The grand jury heard testimony from several witnesses, including Cohen, who pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the NDA and the payment.\n\n## Eligibility for president\n\nThe prosecution of Trump in New York has raised questions about his eligibility to serve as president.

The motion was denied.\n\n## Request for removal to federal court\n\nIn August 2023, Trump's lawyers filed a motion to remove the case to federal court, arguing that the case involved federal issues and that the federal court had jurisdiction. The motion was denied.\n\n## Trial scheduling\n\nIn September 2023, the trial was scheduled to begin on October 2, 2023.\n\n## Gag order\n\nIn September 2023, the trial judge issued a gag order, prohibiting Trump and his lawyers from making public statements about the case.\n\n## Statute of limitations\n\nIn October 2023, Trump's lawyers argued that the statute of limitations had expired on some of the charges. The prosecution argued that the statute of limitations had been tolled due to Trump's alleged concealment of the crimes.\n\n# Overview of witnesses\n\nThe prosecution identified several witnesses who would testify at trial, including:\n\n* Michael Cohen, Trump's former personal attorney\n* Stormy Daniels, adult film actress\n* David Pecker, CEO of American Media, Inc.\n* Hope Hicks, former White House communications director\n* Keith Davidson, former attorney for Daniels\n* Douglas Daus, former employee of the Trump Organization\n\n# Trial\n\n## Jury selection and opening statements\n\nThe trial began on October 2, 2023, with jury selection.

The group was initially composed of ultranationalist and neo-Nazi individuals, but it has since evolved into a more complex organization with multiple branches and ideologies.\n\n# History\n\n## Background and founding, February–April 2014\n\nThe Azov Brigade was formed in February 2014, during the Ukrainian Revolution, by a group of ultranationalist activists led by Andriy Biletsky. The group's initial goal was to defend Ukraine against Russian aggression and to promote Ukrainian nationalism. The Azov Brigade was one of several volunteer militias that emerged during this time, but it quickly gained notoriety due to its neo-Nazi ideology and symbols.\n\n## Special Tasks Patrol Police, May 2014\n\nIn May 2014, the Azov Brigade was officially recognized by the Ukrainian government as a Special Tasks Patrol Police unit, which gave the group official status and access to government resources. This move was seen as an attempt by the Ukrainian government to co-opt the group and bring it under its control. However, the Azov Brigade continued to maintain its independence and its neo-Nazi ideology.\n\n## Reorganisation and incorporation into the National Guard of Ukraine, November 2014\n\nIn November 2014, the Azov Brigade was reorganized and incorporated into the National Guard of Ukraine, a paramilitary force that is responsible for maintaining public order and defending the country against external threats. The group's neo-Nazi ideology was officially renounced, and its leadership was restructured to include more moderate individuals. However, many of the group's original members continued to hold neo-Nazi views, and the group's ideology remained a subject of controversy.\n\n## Battle of Shyrokyne, January 2015\n\nIn January 2015, the Azov Brigade played a key role in the Battle of Shyrokyne, a fierce clash between Ukrainian government forces and Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. The group's performance in the battle was widely praised, and it helped to establish the Azov Brigade as a major player in the Ukrainian military.\n\n## 2016–2019\n\nBetween 2016 and 2019, the Azov Brigade continued to play a major role in the conflict in eastern Ukraine. The group was involved in numerous battles against Russian-backed separatists, and it suffered significant casualties. However, the group's ideology and activities continued to be a subject of controversy, both within Ukraine and internationally.\n\n## Russian invasion of Ukraine\n\nIn 2022, Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine, which led to a significant escalation of the conflict. The Azov Brigade played a key role in the defense of Ukraine, particularly in the city of Mariupol, which was besieged by Russian forces.\n\n### Defense of Mariupol\n\nThe Azov Brigade was one of the main groups defending Mariupol, which was a key strategic location in eastern Ukraine. The group's fighters were involved in fierce battles against Russian forces, and they suffered significant casualties. However, the group's defense of the city helped to slow down the Russian advance and gave the Ukrainian government time to mobilize its forces.\n\n### Other 'Azov' units\n\nIn addition to the Azov Brigade, there are several other units that use the 'Azov' name. These units are often associated with the Azov movement, which is a broader ideological and political movement that promotes Ukrainian nationalism and far-right ideology. Some of these units have been involved in the conflict in eastern Ukraine, while others have been involved in domestic politics and social activism.\n\n# Leadership and organisation\n\n## Commanders\n\nThe Azov Brigade has had several commanders since its founding in 2014. Some of the most notable commanders include Andriy Biletsky, who was the group's founder and first commander, and Maxym Shynkarenko, who was the group's commander during the Battle of Shyrokyne.\n\n## Status\n\nThe Azov Brigade is currently a part of the National Guard of Ukraine, which is a paramilitary force that is responsible for maintaining public order and defending the country against external threats. The group's status within the National Guard is complex, and it has been the subject of controversy and debate.\n\n## Foreign fighters\n\nThe Azov Brigade has attracted foreign fighters from around the world, including from Europe, North America, and Australia. Many of these fighters have been drawn to the group's ideology and its involvement in the conflict in eastern Ukraine. However, the presence of foreign fighters has also been a subject of controversy, particularly in Russia and other countries that have been critical of the Azov Brigade.\n\n# Azov movement\n\n## Azov Civil Corps\n\nThe Azov Civil Corps is a social and political organization that is associated with the Azov Brigade. The group was founded in 2015, and it has been involved in a range of activities, including social activism, charity work, and political organizing.\n\n## National Corps\n\nThe National Corps is a political party that is associated with the Azov movement. The party was founded in 2016, and it has been involved in Ukrainian politics, including in the 2019 parliamentary elections.\n\n## Youth Corps\n\nThe Youth Corps is a youth organization that is associated with the Azov movement. The group was founded in 2015, and it has been involved in a range of activities, including social activism, charity work, and political organizing.\n\n## National Militia, 2017–2020\n\nThe National Militia was a paramilitary organization that was associated with the Azov movement. The group was founded in 2017, and it was involved in a range of activities, including maintaining public order and defending the country against external threats. However, the group was disbanded in 2020 due to controversy and criticism.\n\n## Centuria\n\nCenturia is a social and cultural organization that is associated with the Azov movement.

Many of the group's members have been associated with far-right ideology, and the group's symbols and insignia have been criticized for their resemblance to Nazi imagery.\n\n## Connection to antisemitism\n\nThe Azov Brigade has also been accused of promoting antisemitism.

The JWST is designed to conduct infrared astronomy, observing the universe in the infrared spectrum, and is the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope. The telescope is named after James E. Webb, the second administrator of NASA.\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n### Location and orbit\n\nThe JWST is located in a halo orbit around the L2 (Lagrange point 2), a gravitationally stable location approximately 1.5 million kilometers (930,000 miles) from Earth. This location allows the telescope to maintain a constant distance from the Earth and Sun, keeping its instruments at a stable temperature.\n\n### Sunshield protection\n\nThe JWST has a large sunshield that protects its instruments from the heat and light of the Sun. The sunshield is made of five layers of a material called Kapton, which is designed to reflect sunlight and keep the instruments cool. The sunshield is 22 meters (72 feet) in diameter and is shaped like a kite.\n\n### Optics\n\nThe JWST has a 6.5-meter (21-foot) primary mirror made of 18 hexagonal mirrors that are made of beryllium. The mirrors are designed to be extremely lightweight and are coated with a thin layer of gold to reflect infrared radiation. The telescope also has a secondary mirror that is used to focus the light from the primary mirror.\n\n### Scientific instruments\n\nThe JWST has four scientific instruments:\n\n* The Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) is designed to observe the universe in the near-infrared spectrum.\n* The Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) is designed to analyze the light from distant objects.\n* The Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) is designed to observe the universe in the mid-infrared spectrum.\n* The Fine Guidance Sensor (FGS) is used to guide the telescope and maintain its position.\n\n### Spacecraft bus\n\nThe JWST has a spacecraft bus that provides power, communication, and navigation for the telescope. The spacecraft bus is equipped with solar panels, batteries, and a communication antenna.\n\n### Servicing\n\nThe JWST is designed to be serviced by astronauts, but it is not planned to be serviced in the near future. The telescope has a number of features that make it difficult to service, including its location at L2 and its complex instrument suite.\n\n### Software\n\nThe JWST has a sophisticated software system that controls the telescope and its instruments. The software is designed to be highly reliable and fault-tolerant, and is capable of operating the telescope in a variety of modes.\n\nComparison with other telescopes\n-------------------------------\n\nThe JWST is one of the most advanced space telescopes ever built, and is designed to conduct a wide range of scientific observations. It is more powerful than the Hubble Space Telescope, and has a number of features that make it unique, including its sunshield and its ability to observe the universe in the infrared spectrum.\n\nDevelopment history\n-------------------\n\n### Background (development to 2003)\n\nThe JWST was first proposed in 1996, and was originally designed to be a successor to the Hubble Space Telescope. The telescope was designed to be a general-purpose observatory, and was intended to conduct a wide range of scientific observations.\n\n### Early development and replanning (2003–2007)\n\nIn 2003, NASA began to develop the JWST in earnest, and the telescope was redesigned to be more focused on infrared astronomy. The telescope's instrument suite was also changed, and the sunshield was added to the design.\n\n### Detailed design and construction (2007–2021)\n\nThe JWST was built by a team of scientists and engineers from NASA, the European Space Agency, and the Canadian Space Agency. The telescope was constructed at a number of different locations, including the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland and the Northrop Grumman facility in California.\n\n### Cost and schedule issues\n\nThe JWST was originally estimated to cost $3.5 billion and was scheduled to be launched in 2011. However, the telescope experienced a number of delays and cost overruns, and its final cost was estimated to be around $8.7 billion.\n\n### Partnership\n\nThe JWST was built in partnership with the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency. The telescope was launched on an Ariane 5 rocket, which was provided by the European Space Agency.\n\n### Naming concerns\n\nThe JWST was originally going to be named the Next Generation Space Telescope, but it was later renamed in honor of James E. Webb, the second administrator of NASA. There were some concerns about the naming of the telescope, with some scientists arguing that Webb was not a suitable namesake due to his role in the Lavender Scare.\n\nMission goals\n-------------\n\n### Orbit design\n\nThe JWST is designed to operate in a halo orbit around L2, which is a gravitationally stable location that allows the telescope to maintain a constant distance from the Earth and Sun.\n\n### Infrared astronomy\n\nThe JWST is designed to conduct infrared astronomy, observing the universe in the infrared spectrum.

The site is shrouded in mystery, and its history and significance have been the subject of much debate among scholars. This article aims to provide an overview of the geography, history, and society of Dzuluinicob, as well as its legacy and scholarly significance.\n\n# Geography\n\n## Physical\n\nDzuluinicob is situated in a dense jungle region, characterized by lush vegetation and rugged terrain. The site is nestled between two rivers, which provided a reliable source of water and facilitated trade and communication with neighboring regions. The geography of the area is dominated by a series of hills and valleys, with the site itself situated on a plateau overlooking the surrounding landscape.\n\n## Political\n\nDzuluinicob is located in a region that has been subject to various forms of governance throughout history. In pre-Columbian times, the site was part of a larger network of city-states and regional powers. Following the arrival of European colonizers, the region was absorbed into the Spanish Empire, and later became part of the Mexican Republic. Today, the site is located within the borders of a modern nation-state, and is subject to the laws and regulations of that country.\n\n# History\n\n## Pre-Columbian\n\nThe pre-Columbian history of Dzuluinicob is not well documented, but archaeological evidence suggests that the site was occupied from at least the Classic period (200-900 CE). During this time, the site was likely a major center of trade and commerce, with connections to other regional powers. The site's strategic location and access to natural resources would have made it an attractive location for settlement and trade.\n\n## Columbian\n\nThe arrival of European colonizers in the 16th century had a profound impact on the region and the site of Dzuluinicob. The site was likely affected by the devastating effects of disease, violence, and forced labor that characterized the early colonial period. Many of the site's inhabitants would have been forced to adapt to new forms of governance, economy, and culture, leading to significant changes in the site's social and cultural landscape.\n\n# Society\n\nThe society of Dzuluinicob is not well understood, but archaeological evidence suggests that the site was home to a complex and stratified society. The site's inhabitants would have been organized into different social classes, with different levels of access to resources, power, and prestige. The site's strategic location and access to natural resources would have made it an attractive location for settlement and trade, leading to a diverse and cosmopolitan population.\n\n# Legacy\n\n## Scholarly\n\nDzuluinicob has been the subject of much scholarly interest and debate, with many researchers seeking to understand the site's history, significance, and cultural context. The site's enigmatic nature and lack of documentation have made it a challenging subject for study, but its unique location and cultural significance make it an important area of research.\n\n# Notes and references\n\n## Explanatory footnotes\n\nThis section is intentionally left blank, as the article does not include any citations or references.\n\n## Short citations\n\nThis section is intentionally left blank, as the article does not include any citations or references.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Dzuluinicob\" following this outline:\n\n#Geography\n##Physical\n##Political\n#History\n##Pre-Columbian\n##Columbian\n#Society\n#Legacy\n##Scholarly\n#Notes and references\n##Explanatory footnotes\n##Short citations\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This concept has been explored by various composers throughout history, resulting in some of the most iconic and enduring works in the classical music repertoire. This article will delve into notable sets that cover all 24 keys, variants, keys, order of keys, history, and notable composers who have contributed to this tradition.\n\n# Notable sets that cover all 24 keys\n\nSeveral composers have written sets of pieces that cover all 24 major and minor keys. These sets often showcase a composer's mastery of harmony, counterpoint, and composition.\n\n## Composers who wrote multiple sets\n\nSome notable composers who wrote multiple sets of pieces covering all 24 keys include:\n\n* Johann Sebastian Bach: Bach wrote two sets of preludes and fugues, known as \"The Well-Tempered Clavier,\" which cover all 24 major and minor keys.\n* Frédéric Chopin: Chopin wrote two sets of etudes, Opp. 10 and 25, which cover all 24 major and minor keys.\n* Franz Liszt: Liszt wrote a set of etudes, \"Etudes d'execution transcendante,\" which cover all 24 major and minor keys.\n* Sergei Rachmaninoff: Rachmaninoff wrote two sets of etudes, Opp. 33 and 39, which cover all 24 major and minor keys.\n\n# Variants\n\nWhile sets of pieces covering all 24 keys are the most common, there are other variants that explore similar concepts.\n\n## Single pieces that modulate through many keys\n\nSome pieces, such as Chopin's \"Fantaisie-Impromptu\" and Liszt's \"La campanella,\" modulate through multiple keys, often covering a significant portion of the 24 keys.\n\n## Works covering all eight church modes\n\nThe eight church modes, also known as the Gregorian modes, were used in early Christian music. Some composers, such as Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, wrote works that cover all eight church modes.\n\n## Other sets of 24 pieces\n\nSome composers have written sets of 24 pieces that do not necessarily cover all 24 major and minor keys. For example, Antonín Dvořák's \"Slavonic Dances\" and Johannes Brahms's \"Hungarian Dances\" are sets of 24 pieces that explore folk music traditions.\n\n# Keys\n\nThe order in which keys are presented in published works can vary.\n\n## Order of keys in published works\n\nSome common orders include:\n\n* The \"circle of fifths,\" which arranges keys in a circle based on their tonal relationships.\n* The \"chromatic order,\" which arranges keys in a linear sequence based on their pitch.\n* The \"tonal order,\" which arranges keys based on their tonal relationships.\n\n# History\n\nThe concept of writing music in all major or minor keys has a rich history.\n\n## Bach and his precursors\n\nJohann Sebastian Bach's \"The Well-Tempered Clavier\" is one of the most famous sets of pieces covering all 24 keys. However, Bach was not the first composer to explore this concept. Earlier composers, such as Giovanni Maria Bononcini and Alessandro Scarlatti, wrote sets of pieces that covered multiple keys.\n\n## After Bach\n\nAfter Bach, many composers wrote sets of pieces covering all 24 keys. Some notable examples include:\n\n### 18th and 19th centuries\n\n#### 1750–1850\n\n* Christian Gottlob Neefe: Neefe wrote a set of preludes and fugues that cover all 24 major and minor keys.\n* Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart: Mozart wrote a set of preludes and fugues that cover all 24 major and minor keys.\n\n#### 1851–1900\n\n* Frédéric Chopin: Chopin wrote two sets of etudes, Opp. 10 and 25, which cover all 24 major and minor keys.\n* Franz Liszt: Liszt wrote a set of etudes, \"Etudes d'execution transcendante,\" which cover all 24 major and minor keys.\n\n### 20th century\n\n#### 1901–1950\n\n* Sergei Rachmaninoff: Rachmaninoff wrote two sets of etudes, Opp. 33 and 39, which cover all 24 major and minor keys.\n* Béla Bartók: Bartók wrote a set of piano pieces, \"Mikrokosmos,\" which cover all 24 major and minor keys.\n\n#### 1951–2000\n\n* Olivier Messiaen: Messiaen wrote a set of piano pieces, \"Vingt regards sur l'enfant-Jésus,\" which cover all 24 major and minor keys.\n* György Ligeti: Ligeti wrote a set of piano pieces, \"Musica ricercata,\" which cover all 24 major and minor keys.\n\n### 21st century\n\n* Thomas Adès: Adès wrote a set of piano pieces, \"The Tempest,\" which cover all 24 major and minor keys.\n* Daníel Bjarnason: Bjarnason wrote a set of piano pieces, \"Over Light Earth,\" which cover all 24 major and minor keys.\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article has provided an overview of music written in all major or minor keys. From Bach's \"The Well-Tempered Clavier\" to modern sets of pieces, this concept has been explored by many composers throughout history.\n\n# References\n\nNone\n\n# External links\n\nNone", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Music_written_in_all_major_or_minor_keys\" following this outline:\n\n#Notable sets that cover all 24 keys\n##Composers who wrote multiple sets\n#Variants\n##Single pieces that modulate through many keys\n##Works covering all eight church modes\n##Other sets of 24 pieces\n#Keys\n##Order of keys in published works\n#History\n##Bach and his precursors\n##After Bach\n###18th and 19th centuries\n####1750–1850\n####1851–1900\n###20th century\n####1901–1950\n####1951–2000\n###21st century\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born on November 23, 1985, in Seoul, South Korea, An has had a storied career, marked by numerous accolades and controversies. As one of the most successful short track speed skaters in history, An has won multiple Olympic and World Championship titles, as well as a record number of World Cup medals.\n\nEarly Life and Education\n-------------------------\n\nAn was born in Seoul, South Korea, where he began skating at a young age. He was trained by the Korea Skating Union (KNSU) and quickly rose through the ranks, becoming a promising young skater. An's early life was marked by intense training and dedication to his craft, which would eventually pay off in his successful career.\n\nCareer\n--------\n\n### 2000s\n\n#### Early Career and the 2002 Winter Olympics\n\nAn's international career began in the early 2000s, when he was just a teenager. He quickly made a name for himself, winning multiple World Junior Championship titles. In 2002, An represented South Korea at the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, where he won his first Olympic gold medal in the 1000m event.\n\n#### National Team 'Recommendation System'\n\nDuring this period, An was also part of the KNSU's \"recommendation system,\" which allowed top skaters to receive preferential treatment and support. This system has been criticized for creating a culture of favoritism and corruption within the KNSU.\n\n#### 2002–2005, KNSU and Non-KNSU\n\nBetween 2002 and 2005, An continued to compete for South Korea, winning multiple World Championship titles and World Cup medals. However, he also began to experience conflicts with the KNSU, which would eventually lead to his departure from the organization.\n\n#### 2005, Conflict with Korea Skating Union\n\nIn 2005, An had a public falling out with the KNSU, which he accused of corruption and favoritism. The conflict ultimately led to An's departure from the KNSU and his decision to compete as an independent athlete.\n\n#### 2006 Winter Olympics\n\nAt the 2006 Winter Olympics in Torino, An competed as an independent athlete, winning multiple gold medals and cementing his status as one of the world's top short track speed skaters.\n\n#### After Torino\n\nAfter the 2006 Winter Olympics, An continued to compete at the highest level, winning multiple World Championship titles and World Cup medals. However, he also began to experience conflicts with the KNSU, which he accused of trying to sabotage his career.\n\n#### Injury in Early 2008\n\nIn early 2008, An suffered a serious injury that kept him out of competition for several months. The injury forced An to reevaluate his career and consider retirement.\n\n### 2010s\n\n#### 2010, Conflict with Korea Skating Union\n\nIn 2010, An had another public falling out with the KNSU, which he accused of corruption and favoritism. The conflict ultimately led to An's decision to naturalize to Russia and compete for the Russian national team.\n\n#### Naturalization to Russia\n\nIn 2011, An naturalized to Russia and began competing for the Russian national team. The decision was met with controversy, with some accusing An of betraying his native South Korea.\n\n#### 2011, Conflict with the South Korean Coaches\n\nIn 2011, An had a public falling out with the South Korean coaches, who he accused of trying to sabotage his career. The conflict ultimately led to An's decision to sever ties with the South Korean skating community.\n\n#### Heading to Sochi\n\nAt the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, An competed for Russia, winning multiple gold medals and cementing his status as one of the world's top short track speed skaters.\n\n#### 2014 Winter Olympics\n\nAt the 2014 Winter Olympics, An won multiple gold medals, including the 1000m and 500m events. The victories cemented An's status as one of the greatest short track speed skaters in history.\n\n#### After Sochi\n\nAfter the 2014 Winter Olympics, An continued to compete at the highest level, winning multiple World Championship titles and World Cup medals. However, he also began to experience conflicts with the Russian skating community, which he accused of favoritism and corruption.\n\n#### Retirement\n\nIn 2018, An announced his retirement from competitive skating, citing a desire to pursue other interests and spend more time with his family.\n\n### 2020s\n\n#### 2022 Winter Olympics\n\nAt the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, An competed as a member of the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) team, winning multiple gold medals and cementing his status as one of the greatest short track speed skaters in history.\n\n#### Failure to Return to South Korea for Coaching\n\nIn 2022, An was offered a coaching position with the South Korean national team, but he declined, citing a desire to remain in Russia and pursue other interests.\n\n#### South Korean Leadership Activities\n\nIn 2022, An became involved in South Korean leadership activities, including work with the Korea Sports Promotion Foundation.

Ron Hubbard, was an American author, philosopher, and the founder of Scientology. Born on March 13, 1911, in Tilden, Nebraska, Hubbard's life was marked by a series of transformations, from a young science fiction writer to a self-help author, and eventually to the founder of a global religious movement.\n\n# Life\n\n## Before Dianetics\n\n### Pre-war fiction\n\nHubbard's early life was marked by a passion for writing. He began writing science fiction stories in his teenage years and published his first stories in 1934. Throughout the 1930s, Hubbard wrote prolifically, producing numerous short stories, novels, and screenplays. His writing career was interrupted by World War II, during which he served in the US Navy.\n\n### Military career\n\nIn 1941, Hubbard joined the US Navy, where he served on various ships and eventually became the commanding officer of a patrol boat. Hubbard's military career was marked by controversy, with some questioning the accuracy of his war stories and the extent of his injuries. Despite this, Hubbard was awarded several medals for his service.\n\n### After the war\n\nAfter the war, Hubbard returned to writing, producing works such as \"Fear\" (1940) and \"Typewriter in the Sky\" (1940). He also became involved in the Los Angeles science fiction community, befriending authors such as Robert A. Heinlein and Arthur C. Clarke.\n\n## In the Dianetics era\n\nIn 1949, Hubbard began developing his self-help system, Dianetics. He drew on his experiences as a science fiction writer, as well as his interests in psychology and philosophy, to create a system that aimed to help people overcome their mental and emotional traumas. Hubbard's book \"Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health\" (1950) became a bestseller, and Dianetics quickly gained a following.\n\n## Pivot to Scientology\n\nAs Hubbard continued to develop Dianetics, he began to incorporate spiritual and philosophical elements into his teachings. In 1952, he founded the first Scientology church in Wichita, Kansas. Hubbard's new movement, Scientology, aimed to help individuals achieve spiritual enlightenment and freedom from the constraints of the material world.\n\n## In the Church of Scientology era\n\nThroughout the 1950s and 1960s, Hubbard expanded Scientology, establishing churches and training centers around the world. He also developed a range of spiritual practices, including auditing, which aimed to help individuals overcome their past traumas and achieve spiritual enlightenment.\n\n## In the Sea Org era\n\nIn 1967, Hubbard founded the Sea Organization (Sea Org), a paramilitary organization within Scientology. The Sea Org aimed to provide a more disciplined and dedicated group of followers, who would help Hubbard to expand Scientology and protect it from external threats.\n\n## In hiding\n\nIn the 1970s, Hubbard's personal life became increasingly reclusive. He lived on a ship, the Apollo, which sailed around the world, and eventually settled in a secret location in California. Hubbard's health declined in the 1980s, and he died on January 24, 1986, at the age of 74.\n\n# Sources and doctrines\n\nHubbard's teachings drew on a range of sources, including science fiction, philosophy, psychology, and spirituality. His doctrines, as outlined in his numerous books and lectures, emphasized the importance of self-improvement, spiritual growth, and the attainment of spiritual freedom.\n\n# False biographical claims\n\nThroughout his life, Hubbard made several false claims about his biography, including his military service and his academic achievements. These claims have been extensively debunked by critics and scholars.\n\n# Legacy\n\n## In Scientology\n\nHubbard's legacy within Scientology is deeply contested. To his followers, he is revered as a spiritual leader and a visionary. However, critics have questioned the accuracy of his teachings and the authoritarian nature of the Scientology organization.\n\n## In popular culture\n\nHubbard's influence can be seen in popular culture, particularly in the science fiction genre. His ideas about spiritual growth and self-improvement have also influenced the self-help movement.\n\n# Select works\n\n* \"Fear\" (1940)\n* \"Typewriter in the Sky\" (1940)\n* \"Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health\" (1950)\n* \"Science of Survival\" (1951)\n* \"Self-Analysis\" (1951)\n\n# See also\n\n* Scientology\n* Dianetics\n* Sea Organization\n* E-meter\n\n# Notes\n\n* This article is based on publicly available information and does not reflect the views of any individual or organization.\n\n# References\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements.)\n\n# Works cited\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements.)\n\n# Further reading\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements.)\n\n# External links\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements.)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"L._Ron_Hubbard\" following this outline:\n\n#Life\n##Before Dianetics\n###Pre-war fiction\n###Military career\n###After the war\n##In the Dianetics era\n##Pivot to Scientology\n##In the Church of Scientology era\n##In the Sea Org era\n##In hiding\n#Sources and doctrines\n#False biographical claims\n#Legacy\n##In Scientology\n##In popular culture\n#Select works\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Works cited\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The reforms aim to significantly alter the powers and structure of the Israeli judiciary, sparking intense debate and controversy within Israeli society and internationally.\n\n# Background\n\n## Israeli Supreme Court and judicial review\n\nThe Israeli Supreme Court, also known as the High Court of Justice (HCJ), is the highest court in the Israeli judicial system. Established in 1948, the Court has played a crucial role in shaping the country's constitutional law and ensuring the protection of individual rights. One of the Court's key powers is its ability to conduct judicial review, which enables it to review and strike down laws and government decisions that it deems unconstitutional or unreasonable.\n\n## 1992 Constitutional Revolution and its discontents\n\nIn 1992, the Israeli Supreme Court underwent a significant transformation, known as the Constitutional Revolution. During this period, the Court adopted a more activist approach to judicial review, striking down several laws and government decisions that it deemed inconsistent with Israel's Basic Laws. While the Constitutional Revolution was hailed by some as a significant step forward for Israeli democracy, others criticized the Court for overstepping its authority and undermining the power of the elected branches of government.\n\n## 2018–2022 Israeli political crisis and 2022 legislative election\n\nBetween 2018 and 2022, Israel experienced a prolonged period of political instability, marked by four inconclusive elections and a succession of caretaker governments. In the 2022 legislative election, the right-wing Likud party, led by Benjamin Netanyahu, emerged as the largest party, but failed to secure a majority. Netanyahu ultimately formed a coalition government with several right-wing and ultra-Orthodox parties, which included several ministers who had long been critical of the Israeli judiciary.\n\n# Legislative history\n\n## HCJ 5658/23 Movement for Quality Government in Israel v. Knesset (2024)\n\nIn response to the proposed reforms, several petitioners, including the Movement for Quality Government in Israel, filed a petition with the High Court of Justice, challenging the constitutionality of the reforms. The case, known as HCJ 5658/23, is ongoing, and a decision is expected in 2024.\n\n# Proposed changes\n\n## Judicial selection\n\n### Current system\n\nUnder the current system, judges are selected by the Judicial Selection Committee, a nine-member panel consisting of three Supreme Court justices, two cabinet ministers, two Knesset members, and two representatives of the Israel Bar Association. The Committee operates by consensus, and its recommendations are typically adopted by the government.\n\n### Proposed system\n\nThe proposed reforms would significantly alter the composition of the Judicial Selection Committee, increasing the number of politicians on the panel and reducing the number of judges. Under the new system, the Committee would consist of 11 members, including four politicians, three judges, and four representatives of the Israel Bar Association.\n\n### Arguments in favor of the reform\n\nProponents of the reform argue that the current system is too opaque and allows the judiciary to select its own members, leading to a lack of diversity and a narrow range of perspectives. By increasing the number of politicians on the Committee, the reform aims to introduce more diverse perspectives and ensure that judges are more accountable to the elected branches of government.\n\n### Arguments against the reform\n\nCritics of the reform argue that it would undermine the independence of the judiciary and allow politicians to pack the courts with sympathetic judges. By reducing the number of judges on the Committee, the reform would also reduce the ability of the judiciary to ensure that new judges have the necessary qualifications and experience.\n\n## Government legal advisors\n\nThe proposed reforms would also give the government greater control over the appointment of government legal advisors, including the Attorney-General. Under the current system, the Attorney-General is appointed by the government, but is also responsible for advising the government on the legality of its actions. The reform would allow the government to appoint a new Attorney-General who is more sympathetic to its views.\n\n## Constitutional review\n\nThe proposed reforms would limit the ability of the High Court of Justice to conduct constitutional review, restricting its ability to strike down laws and government decisions that are deemed unconstitutional. The reform would also introduce a new \"override clause,\" which would allow the Knesset to override a High Court decision striking down a law, provided that a majority of 61 Knesset members support the override.\n\n## Override clause\n\nThe override clause would allow the Knesset to override a High Court decision striking down a law, provided that a majority of 61 Knesset members support the override. Proponents of the reform argue that this would ensure that the elected branches of government have the final say on matters of policy, while critics argue that it would undermine the ability of the judiciary to protect individual rights and the rule of law.\n\n## Abolition of \"unreasonableness\" grounds\n\nThe proposed reforms would also abolish the \"unreasonableness\" grounds for judicial review, which allows the High Court of Justice to strike down government decisions that are deemed unreasonable. Proponents of the reform argue that this would reduce the ability of the judiciary to micromanage government decision-making, while critics argue that it would allow the government to make arbitrary and unreasonable decisions without accountability.\n\n### Arguments in favor of the reform\n\nProponents of the reform argue that the abolition of the \"unreasonableness\" grounds would allow the government to make decisions without fear of judicial interference, and would reduce the number of frivolous petitions filed with the High Court of Justice.\n\n### Arguments against the reform\n\nCritics of the reform argue that the abolition of the \"unreasonableness\" grounds would allow the government to make arbitrary and unreasonable decisions without accountability, and would undermine the ability of the judiciary to protect individual rights and the rule of law.\n\n## Status of the Attorney-General\n\nThe proposed reforms would also give the Attorney-General greater independence and autonomy, allowing him to make decisions without fear of government interference. However, critics argue that this would also reduce the ability of the Attorney-General to advise the government on the legality of its actions, and would create a conflict of interest between the Attorney-General's role as a government advisor and his role as an independent law enforcement officer.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## National\n\nThe proposed reforms have sparked intense debate within Israeli society, with supporters arguing that they are necessary to restore the balance of power between the judiciary and the elected branches of government, while critics argue that they would undermine the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law.\n\n## International\n\nThe proposed reforms have also sparked international concern, with several countries and international organizations expressing concerns about the impact of the reforms on the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law in Israel.\n\n## Connection to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict\n\nSome critics of the reforms have argued that they are connected to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and that they would allow the government to pursue policies that are detrimental to the rights of Palestinians without fear of judicial review.

Kennedy\n\nThe assassination of John F. Kennedy, the 35th President of the United States, occurred on November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas. Kennedy was shot while riding in an open-top car in a motorcade through Dealey Plaza, a public park in downtown Dallas. The event shocked the nation and led to a wave of grief, speculation, and investigation that continues to this day.\n\n# Background\n\n## Kennedy\n\nJohn F. Kennedy was born on May 29, 1917, in Brookline, Massachusetts. He served in the U.S. Navy during World War II and later became a congressman and senator from Massachusetts. In 1960, he was elected President, defeating Republican candidate Richard Nixon in a close election. Kennedy's presidency was marked by significant events, including the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Bay of Pigs invasion, and the early stages of the Vietnam War.\n\n## Oswald\n\nLee Harvey Oswald was born on October 18, 1939, in New Orleans, Louisiana. He grew up in a troubled home and dropped out of high school. Oswald served in the U.S. Marine Corps and later defected to the Soviet Union, where he lived for several years. He returned to the United States in 1962 and began working at the Texas School Book Depository in Dallas.\n\n# November 22\n\n## Kennedy's arrival in Dallas and route to Dealey Plaza\n\nOn November 22, 1963, President Kennedy arrived at Love Field in Dallas, Texas, on a campaign trip to boost his re-election chances. He was accompanied by First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy, Texas Governor John Connally, and Senator Ralph Yarborough. After a brief speech at the airport, the presidential motorcade began its journey through downtown Dallas, with the President and First Lady riding in an open-top 1961 Lincoln Continental limousine.\n\n## Shooting\n\nAt around 12:30 pm, the motorcade entered Dealey Plaza, a public park in downtown Dallas. As the limousine turned onto Elm Street, shots rang out from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository building. One bullet struck Kennedy in the neck, and another bullet hit him in the head. The President slumped forward, and the limousine sped away to Parkland Memorial Hospital.\n\n## Aftermath in Dealey Plaza\n\nPanic broke out in Dealey Plaza as people realized what had happened. Witnesses pointed to the Texas School Book Depository building, and police officers rushed to the scene. Lee Harvey Oswald, who had been watching the motorcade from the sixth floor, fled the building and left his rifle behind.\n\n## Oswald's flight, killing of J. D. Tippit, and arrest\n\nOswald walked to the nearby Greyhound bus station and boarded a bus, but he got off a few blocks away. He then walked to the Texas Theatre, a movie theater in the Oak Cliff neighborhood of Dallas. At around 1:45 pm, Oswald shot and killed Dallas police officer J. D. Tippit, who had stopped him for questioning. After a brief struggle, Oswald was arrested by police", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Kennedy\n##Oswald\n#November 22\n##Kennedy's arrival in Dallas and route to Dealey Plaza\n##Shooting\n##Aftermath in Dealey Plaza\n##Oswald's flight, killing of J.

The protests, which were sparked by Amini's death, quickly evolved into a broader movement against the Islamic Republic's government and its policies, particularly those related to women's rights and freedoms.\n\n# Background\n\n## Condition of women and the Islamic Republic\n\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran has been criticized for its treatment of women, who face strict laws and regulations governing their behavior, dress, and movement. Women in Iran are required to wear the hijab, a headscarf, in public, and are subject to strict dress codes. They are also barred from certain professions and are restricted in their ability to travel and obtain education.\n\n## Protest movements under the Islamic Republic\n\nThe Islamic Republic has faced numerous protest movements since its establishment in 1979, with many of these movements focusing on issues related to democracy, human rights, and women's rights. The most notable of these protests was the 2009 Green Movement, which was sparked by allegations of electoral fraud and saw widespread demonstrations against the government.\n\n## Mahsa Amini's arrest and death in custody\n\nOn September 13, 2022, Mahsa Amini was arrested by Iran's morality police in Tehran for allegedly violating the country's dress code. Amini was taken to a police station, where she was beaten and suffered a heart attack. She was taken to a hospital, where she died on September 16, 2022. The government claimed that Amini had died from a pre-existing medical condition, but her family and eyewitnesses disputed this, saying that she had been beaten by police.\n\n# Protests\n\n## Slogans and grievances\n\nThe protests that followed Amini's death were marked by slogans and chants calling for an end to the Islamic Republic and its policies. Protesters also called for the resignation of President Ebrahim Raisi and the release of all political prisoners. The protests were fueled by widespread anger and frustration with the government's treatment of women, as well as its handling of the economy, education, and healthcare.\n\n## Iranian public opinion\n\nThe protests were widely supported by the Iranian public, with many people taking to social media to express their outrage and solidarity with the protesters. According to a survey conducted by the Iranian Students' Polling Agency, 80% of Iranians believed that the government was responsible for Amini's death, and 75% believed that the protests were justified.\n\n## Protest techniques\n\nProtesters used a variety of techniques to evade the police and security forces, including the use of social media to coordinate their movements and the use of proxy servers to avoid internet shutdowns. They also used traditional protest tactics, such as chanting slogans, waving flags, and blocking streets.\n\n## Civil boycotts\n\nMany Iranians participated in civil boycotts, refusing to buy goods or services from companies that were seen as supporting the government. They also called for international companies to boycott Iran and for governments to impose sanctions on the country.\n\n## Media Western coverage\n\nThe protests received widespread coverage in Western media, with many outlets focusing on the bravery and resilience of the protesters. The coverage was seen as largely sympathetic to the protesters, with many outlets condemning the government's response to the protests.\n\n# Casualties, government response\n\n## Casualties\n\nAccording to human rights groups, at least 500 people were killed in the protests, including protesters, security forces, and bystanders. Many more were injured, and thousands were arrested.\n\n### Government casualties", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Mahsa_Amini_protests\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Condition of women and the Islamic Republic\n##Protest movements under the Islamic Republic\n##Mahsa Amini's arrest and death in custody\n#Protests\n##Slogans and greviances\n##Iranian public opinion\n##Protest techniques\n##Civil boycotts\n##Media Western coverage\n#Casualties, government response\n##Casualties\n###Government casualties\n##Arrests and death sentences\n###Executions\n##Suspected food poisoning\n###University students\n###Schoolgirls\n##Statements by officials\n##Government strategy and tactics\n##Communications blackouts\n##Response by regime supporters\n##Government campaign for public opinion\n#Aftermath\n##Lack of head covering\n###Crackdown\n###Surveillance of protesters and dissidents\n#Analysis\n#International reactions\n##International organizations\n##Diplomatic ties\n##Human rights advocates\n##Sanctions\n#In popular culture\n##Music\n##Sports\n###2022 FIFA World Cup\n###Commercialism\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is based on the popular video game series of the same name by Naughty Dog. The film stars Tom Holland, Mark Wahlberg, and Antonio Banderas.\n\nPlot\n\nThe film follows the story of Nathan Drake (Tom Holland), a young and charismatic treasure hunter who is recruited by Victor Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg), a seasoned adventurer, to find a long-lost treasure. The two embark on a perilous journey to find the treasure, which is also being sought after by the wealthy and ruthless Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas). Along the way, Nathan and Sully encounter various obstacles and challenges, including treacherous terrain, rival treasure hunters, and historical puzzles.\n\nAs they navigate through the jungle, Nathan and Sully develop a bond and learn to trust each other. They also discover that the treasure is linked to a historical event and that Moncada's true intentions are far more sinister than they initially thought. The film's plot is full of twists and turns, keeping the audience engaged and invested in the characters' journey.\n\nCast\n\n* Tom Holland as Nathan Drake\n* Mark Wahlberg as Victor Sullivan\n* Antonio Banderas as Santiago Moncada\n* Tati Gabrielle as Braddock\n* Sophia Ali as Chloe Frazer\n\nProduction\n\nDevelopment\n\nThe film has been in development since 2008, with various directors and writers attached to the project over the years.

However, Levy left the project in 2018, and Ruben Fleischer was brought on board to direct.\n\nPre-production\n\nPre-production began in 2020, with the cast undergoing training and rehearsals. Tom Holland performed most of his stunts, which added to the film's authenticity. The film's script was also finalized during this period, with the writers making sure to stay true to the spirit of the video game series.\n\nFilming\n\nPrincipal photography began in March 2020 and lasted for several months. The film was shot on location in various countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Spain. The crew faced several challenges during filming, including inclement weather and COVID-19 restrictions. Despite these challenges, the film was completed on schedule, and post-production began soon after.\n\nMusic\n\nThe film's score was composed by Ramin Djawadi, who is known for his work on the Iron Man and Game of Thrones franchises. The score is a mix of action-packed themes and more emotional, character-driven pieces. The film also features several popular songs, including \"Maps\" by the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and \"Best Day of My Life\" by American Authors.\n\nRelease\n\nTheatrical\n\nUncharted was released in the United States on February 18, 2022, by Sony Pictures Releasing.

The ban was met with criticism from fans and the film's cast, who felt that it was unfair and unjustified.\n\nHome media\n\nUncharted was released on digital platforms on April 26, 2022, and on DVD and Blu-ray on May 10, 2022. The home media release includes several bonus features, including deleted scenes, behind-the-scenes footage, and a making-of documentary.\n\nMarketing\n\nThe film's marketing campaign began in 2021, with the release of the first trailer.

The film performed well in several countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. The film's box office performance was seen as a positive sign for the video game film genre, which has struggled in recent years.\n\nCritical response\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the film's action sequences and the chemistry between the leads but criticized the film's plot and characters. The film holds a 68% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 222 reviews, with an average rating of 6.2/10.\n\nSequel\n\nA sequel to Uncharted was announced in February 2022, with Tom Holland set to reprise his role as Nathan Drake.

The history of women's cinema is a long and complex one, spanning multiple continents and decades. This article will provide an overview of the history of women's cinema, its impact on society, and notable female filmmakers from around the world.\n\nFamous Women in Film History\n-----------------------------\n\n### Silent Films\n\nDuring the silent film era, women played a significant role in the development of cinema. One of the most notable female filmmakers of this era was Alice Guy-Blaché, a French director who made over 700 films between 1896 and 1922. Guy-Blaché was not only a prolific director but also a pioneer in the use of special effects and narrative storytelling. Another notable female filmmaker of the silent era was Lois Weber, an American director who made over 40 films between 1911 and 1934. Weber was known for her socially conscious films that explored themes of poverty, addiction, and women's rights.\n\n### Classical Hollywood\n\nDuring the classical Hollywood era, women continued to play a significant role in the film industry. One of the most notable female filmmakers of this era was Dorothy Arzner, an American director who made over 20 films between 1927 and 1943. Arzner was known for her work on films such as \"The Wild Party\" (1929) and \"Dance, Girl, Dance\" (1940). Another notable female filmmaker of this era was Ida Lupino, an American actress and director who made over 10 films between 1949 and 1966. Lupino was known for her work on films such as \"The Bigamist\" (1953) and \"The Trouble with Angels\" (1966).\n\n### Experimental and Avant-Garde Cinema\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, women began to make a significant impact on the experimental and avant-garde film movement. One of the most notable female filmmakers of this era was Maya Deren, an American director who made over 10 films between 1943 and 1961. Deren was known for her experimental films that explored themes of identity, culture, and the human condition. Another notable female filmmaker of this era was Shirley Clarke, an American director who made over 10 films between 1953 and 1987. Clarke was known for her experimental films that explored themes of identity, politics, and social justice.\n\nImpact on Society\n------------------\n\n### Impact of Second-Wave Feminism\n\nThe women's liberation movement of the 1960s and 1970s had a significant impact on the film industry. Women began to demand greater representation and opportunities in the industry, and films began to reflect the changing roles of women in society. One of the most notable films of this era was \"A Question of Silence\" (1982), a Dutch film directed by Marleen Gorris that explored the theme of female silence and oppression.\n\n### Representing Sexuality\n\nWomen's cinema has also played a significant role in representing female sexuality on screen. One of the most notable films of this era was \"Daughters of Darkness\" (1971), a Belgian-French-German film directed by Harry Kümel that explored the theme of female desire and pleasure. Another notable film of this era was \"The Piano\" (1993), a New Zealand film directed by Jane Campion that explored the theme of female creativity and desire.\n\n### Fear of Entering Cinematography\n\nDespite the progress made by women in the film industry, many women still face significant barriers to entry. One of the most significant barriers is the fear of entering a male-dominated industry. Many women are discouraged from pursuing careers in film because of the lack of female role models and the perception that the industry is hostile to women.\n\n### Statistics\n\nDespite the progress made by women in the film industry, women still make up a small percentage of filmmakers. According to a 2020 report by the Sundance Institute, women made up only 24% of filmmakers at the Sundance Film Festival. Another report by the USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative found that women made up only 15% of directors and 20% of writers on the 100 top-grossing films of 2019.\n\n### Documentaries\n\nWomen's cinema has also played a significant role in the documentary film movement. One of the most notable documentary filmmakers is Barbara Kopple, an American director who has made over 10 films on subjects such as labor rights, social justice, and human rights. Another notable documentary filmmaker is Laura Poitras, an American director who has made over 10 films on subjects such as surveillance, national security, and human rights.\n\n#### Female Filmmakers as Feminists\n\nMany female filmmakers identify as feminists and use their films to explore themes of interest to women. One of the most notable feminist filmmakers is Agnès Varda, a French director who has made over 50 films on subjects such as female identity, culture, and politics. Another notable feminist filmmaker is Ava DuVernay, an American director who has made over 10 films on subjects such as racial justice, social justice, and human rights.\n\n### Celluloid Ceiling\n\nThe celluloid ceiling refers to the barriers that prevent women from advancing in the film industry. One of the most significant barriers is the lack of opportunities for women to direct and produce films. According to a 2020 report by the Sundance Institute, women made up only 24% of filmmakers at the Sundance Film Festival. Another report by the USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative found that women made up only 15% of directors and 20% of writers on the 100 top-grossing films of 2019.\n\nNorth America\n------------\n\n### Canada\n\nCanada has a thriving film industry, and women have played a significant role in its development.

SVB was a leading bank in the technology and startup sector, providing financial services to many prominent companies and venture capital firms. The bank's collapse had far-reaching effects on its customers, shareholders, and the broader financial system.\n\n#Background\n\nSilicon Valley Bank was founded in 1983 and was headquartered in Santa Clara, California. The bank specialized in providing financial services to technology and life science companies, as well as venture capital and private equity firms. SVB was known for its expertise in serving the unique financial needs of these industries, offering services such as cash management, lending, and investment banking.\n\nOver the years, SVB grew rapidly, expanding its operations to include offices in the United States, Europe, and Asia. The bank became a major player in the technology and startup ecosystem, serving many prominent companies, including Airbnb, Uber, and Tesla. SVB also had strong relationships with venture capital firms, providing financing to many startups and early-stage companies.\n\n#Collapse\n\nThe collapse of SVB was triggered by a combination of factors, including losses on its investment portfolio, instability in the financial markets, and a decline in the bank's deposits.\n\n##Losses\n\nSVB's investment portfolio, which included a significant amount of long-term bonds, suffered losses due to rising interest rates. As interest rates increased, the value of the bonds declined, resulting in significant losses for the bank. Additionally, SVB's investment in tech stocks and other venture capital-backed companies also declined in value, further exacerbating the bank's losses.\n\n##Instability\n\nThe financial markets became increasingly unstable in the months leading up to SVB's collapse. The COVID-19 pandemic had created economic uncertainty, and the Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates to combat inflation had led to a decline in the value of many assets. This instability, combined with SVB's losses, created a perfect storm that ultimately led to the bank's collapse.\n\n##Receivership\n\nOn March 10, 2023, the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation closed SVB and placed it into receivership. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) was appointed as the receiver, and it immediately took control of the bank's operations. The FDIC's primary goal was to stabilize the bank's operations and protect its depositors.\n\n##Acquisition\n\nOn March 26, 2023, the FDIC announced that it had sold SVB's assets to First Citizens Bank & Trust Company. The acquisition included SVB's deposits, loans, and investment portfolio. The deal was structured to minimize disruption to SVB's customers and employees, with First Citizens Bank committing to retain many of SVB's employees and maintain its operations in the technology and startup sector.\n\n#Effects\n\nThe collapse of SVB had significant effects on its customers, shareholders, and the broader financial system.\n\n##Customers\n\nSVB's customers, many of whom were technology and startup companies, were affected by the bank's collapse. Some companies experienced difficulties accessing their funds, while others were forced to seek alternative banking arrangements. However, the FDIC's quick action in stabilizing the bank's operations and the subsequent acquisition by First Citizens Bank minimized the disruption to SVB's customers.\n\n##Shareholders\n\nSVB's shareholders suffered significant losses as a result of the bank's collapse. The bank's stock price declined sharply in the days leading up to its collapse, and many shareholders were left with significant losses. The acquisition by First Citizens Bank did not provide any compensation to SVB's shareholders, further exacerbating their losses.\n\n##Financial system\n\nThe collapse of SVB had broader implications for the financial system. The event highlighted the risks associated with banks that specialize in serving specific industries, such as technology and startups. It also raised concerns about the stability of the financial system and the potential for future bank failures.\n\n##Legal actions\n\nIn the aftermath of SVB's collapse, several legal actions were initiated. The FDIC filed a lawsuit against the bank's former executives and directors, alleging that they had engaged in reckless and negligent behavior that contributed to the bank's collapse. Additionally, several shareholder class-action lawsuits were filed, alleging that the bank's executives and directors had made false and misleading statements about the bank's financial condition.\n\n#Reactions\n\nThe collapse of SVB sparked a range of reactions from government officials, industry experts, and the broader public.\n\n##Official responses\n\nGovernment officials, including the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, responded quickly to SVB's collapse. The FDIC's prompt action in stabilizing the bank's operations and the subsequent acquisition by First Citizens Bank helped to minimize the disruption to SVB's customers and the broader financial system.\n\n##Debate over government intervention\n\nThe collapse of SVB sparked a debate over the role of government intervention in the financial system. Some argued that the government should have done more to prevent the bank's collapse, while others argued that the government's actions were sufficient and that the bank's failure was a necessary consequence of its reckless behavior.\n\n##Debate about causes\n\nThere was also a debate about the causes of SVB's collapse. Some attributed the bank's failure to its reckless investment strategies and poor risk management, while others argued that the bank was a victim of broader economic trends and instability in the financial markets.\n\n#See also\n\n* List of bank failures in the United States\n* Financial crisis of 2007-2008\n* Silicon Valley Bank\n* First Citizens Bank & Trust Company\n* Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Collapse_of_Silicon_Valley_Bank\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Collapse\n##Losses\n##Instability\n##Receivership\n##Acquisition\n#Effects\n##Customers\n##Shareholders\n##Financial system\n##Legal actions\n#Reactions\n##Official responses\n##Debate over government intervention\n##Debate about causes\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

L. Zissu\n\nA. L. Zissu was a prominent Hasidic scholar, journalist, and Jewish leader in Romania during the interwar period and the early years of communism. His life was marked by his dedication to Jewish causes, his resistance to Nazi persecution, and his eventual imprisonment and death at the hands of the communist authorities.\n\n#Biography\n\n##Hasidic scholar and journalistic debut\n\nA. L. Zissu was born in 1888 in the town of Vijnita, in the province of Bukovina, which was then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He came from a family of Hasidic Jews and was educated in the traditional manner, studying Talmud and other Jewish texts from a young age. Zissu's intellectual talents and passion for learning quickly set him apart, and he became a respected scholar within the Hasidic community.\n\nIn addition to his scholarly pursuits, Zissu was also drawn to journalism. He began writing for local Jewish newspapers and eventually became the editor of the influential publication \" Hatikvah\" (The Hope). Through his writing, Zissu aimed to promote Jewish culture and interests, as well as to provide a voice for the Jewish community in Romania.\n\n##Religious Zionism\n\nZissu's involvement in journalism also led him to become increasingly interested in the Zionist movement. He was particularly drawn to the ideology of Religious Zionism, which sought to combine traditional Jewish faith with the goal of establishing a Jewish homeland in Palestine. Zissu saw Zionism as a way to revitalize Jewish life and to provide a safe haven for Jews facing persecution in Europe.\n\nAs a prominent figure within the Jewish community, Zissu played a key role in promoting Religious Zionism in Romania. He worked closely with other Zionist leaders, including Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook, who would later become the Chief Rabbi of Palestine. Through his writings and public speeches, Zissu helped to galvanize support for the Zionist cause among Romanian Jews.\n\n##Nazi persecution\n\nThe rise of Nazi Germany in the 1930s posed a significant threat to Jewish communities across Europe. In Romania, the fascist Iron Guard movement, led by Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, began to gain popularity, promoting anti-Semitic policies and violence against Jews. Zissu, as a prominent Jewish leader, was a vocal critic of the Iron Guard and its ideology.\n\nAs the Nazi threat grew, Zissu became increasingly involved in efforts to resist persecution. He worked with other Jewish leaders to establish self-defense organizations and to provide support for Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi-occupied territories. Zissu's activism, however, also made him a target for the authorities, and he faced harassment and intimidation from the Romanian police.\n\n##Resistance movement\n\nFollowing the invasion of Romania by Nazi Germany in 1940, Zissu became involved in the resistance movement. He worked closely with other anti-Nazi activists, including members of the Romanian Communist Party, to disrupt German operations and to provide support for Jewish partisans.\n\nZissu's involvement in the resistance movement was marked by bravery and cunning. He used his knowledge of the Jewish community and his journalistic skills to gather intelligence and to spread propaganda against the Nazi occupiers. Zissu's efforts, however, were not without risk, and he was eventually arrested by the Gestapo in 1943.\n\n##Jewish leadership\n\nFollowing his release from prison, Zissu continued to play a leading role in Jewish affairs in Romania. He worked closely with other Jewish leaders to provide support for Jewish communities and to promote Jewish causes. Zissu's leadership was marked by wisdom and compassion, and he earned the respect of Jews and non-Jews alike.\n\n##Against communism\n\nAs the war drew to a close, Zissu became increasingly concerned about the spread of communism in Eastern Europe. He saw the Soviet Union as a threat to Jewish autonomy and to the values of democracy and freedom. Through his writings and public speeches, Zissu spoke out against communism, advocating for a more democratic and pluralistic approach to governance.\n\n##Securitate set-up and imprisonment\n\nZissu's anti-communist stance, however, made him a target for the authorities. In 1948, he was arrested by the Securitate, the Romanian secret police, on charges of espionage and subversion. The charges were trumped up, and Zissu's imprisonment was a clear attempt to silence him.\n\n##Trial, reprieve, and death\n\nZissu's trial was a sham, with the outcome predetermined. He was sentenced to life imprisonment, but his health was already deteriorating. In 1954, Zissu was released from prison, reportedly due to international pressure.

He was the chairman of Action Aviation, a company that specializes in aircraft sales and leasing. Harding was also a renowned explorer who had traveled to some of the most remote and inhospitable regions of the world. His passion for adventure and exploration led him to undertake numerous expeditions, including a record-breaking dive to the bottom of the Mariana Trench.\n\n#Early life and education\n\nHamish Harding was born on February 23, 1964, in England. He grew up in a family of modest means and was the youngest of three siblings. Harding's parents encouraged his sense of adventure from an early age, and he spent much of his childhood exploring the outdoors. He developed a passion for aviation at the age of 10, when he first saw a plane take off from a nearby airfield.\n\nHarding attended the University of London, where he studied economics and politics. During his time at university, he became involved in various extracurricular activities, including the university's flying club. He earned his private pilot's license at the age of 20 and went on to fly for several airlines before starting his own aviation company.\n\n#Career and adventures\n\nAfter graduating from university, Harding worked as a pilot for several airlines, including British Airways and Virgin Atlantic. However, he soon became disillusioned with the routine of commercial flying and decided to start his own aviation company. In 1993, Harding founded Action Aviation, which specialized in aircraft sales and leasing.\n\nThrough Action Aviation, Harding was able to pursue his passion for adventure and exploration. He undertook numerous expeditions, including a trip to the North Pole, a crossing of the Sahara Desert, and a dive to the bottom of the Red Sea. Harding's adventures took him to some of the most remote and inhospitable regions of the world, including Antarctica, the Amazon rainforest, and the Gobi Desert.\n\n##Titan expedition\n\nIn 2019, Harding embarked on one of his most ambitious expeditions to date: a dive to the bottom of the Mariana Trench, the deepest point in the ocean. Harding partnered with Victor Vescovo, a businessman and explorer, to undertake the expedition. The two men used a submersible vehicle called the Five Deeps to reach the bottom of the trench, which is located in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe expedition was a groundbreaking achievement, as it marked the first time that two people had reached the bottom of the Mariana Trench together. Harding and Vescovo spent several hours at the bottom of the trench, collecting samples and conducting scientific experiments. The expedition was documented by a team of filmmakers, who captured stunning footage of the dive.\n\n#Titan expedition and death\n\nTragically, Harding's life was cut short on June 18, 2023, when he died during a dive to the bottom of the Titan submersible vehicle. Harding was on a research expedition to the ocean floor, accompanied by four other crew members. The submersible vehicle imploded while descending to the ocean floor, resulting in the deaths of all five crew members.\n\nThe incident was met with shock and sadness from the exploration community, who remembered Harding as a pioneering adventurer and explorer. Harding's death was a tragic reminder of the risks involved in exploration and the importance of safety protocols.\n\n#Personal life\n\nHarding was married to his wife, Linda, and had two children, a son and a daughter. He was a private person who kept his personal life out of the spotlight. However, he was known to be a devoted family man who cherished time with his loved ones.\n\nHarding was also a philanthropist who supported several charitable causes, including the Royal Geographical Society and the Explorers Club. He was a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and a member of the Explorers Club, and he often spoke at events and conferences about his adventures and expeditions.\n\n#Awards and recognition\n\nHarding received several awards and honors for his contributions to exploration and aviation.

The storm brought heavy snowfall, high winds, and low visibility, causing widespread disruptions and loss of life. It remains one of the most significant winter storms of the 20th century in terms of its impact on the affected regions.\n\n# Meteorological history\n\nThe Great Snowstorm of 1944 developed on December 26, 1944, over the Great Plains of the United States. A low-pressure system formed over the Rocky Mountains and began to move eastward, intensifying as it interacted with a cold front from Canada. As the storm system moved into the Midwest, it encountered a mass of cold air from the north, causing the snowfall to become heavy and widespread.\n\nThe storm's trajectory took it through the Ohio River Valley, where it merged with a second low-pressure system moving northward from the Gulf of Mexico. This interaction caused the storm to strengthen further, with snowfall rates reaching up to 2-3 inches per hour in some areas. Sustained winds of 30-40 mph and gusts of up to 60 mph contributed to the storm's severity, leading to significant drifting and blowing snow.\n\n# Overall impact\n\nThe Great Snowstorm of 1944 had a profound impact on the regions it affected, with widespread disruptions to transportation, communication, and daily life. The storm's effects were felt from the Midwest to the East Coast, with the worst of the conditions reported in Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, New York, Ontario, and Quebec.\n\nThe storm's severity was exacerbated by the fact that it occurred during the holiday season, when many people were traveling or had made plans for social gatherings. The resulting disruptions and cancellations caused significant inconvenience and hardship for many individuals and families.\n\n# Fatalities and injuries\n\nThe Great Snowstorm of 1944 was responsible for a significant number of fatalities and injuries, primarily due to the hazardous travel conditions and the resulting accidents. According to reports, at least 77 people lost their lives as a direct result of the storm, with many more injured or stranded.\n\nThe causes of death were varied, but included hypothermia, asphyxiation from carbon monoxide poisoning, and injuries sustained in vehicle accidents. The storm's impact was felt particularly hard by vulnerable populations, such as the elderly and young children, who were more susceptible to the harsh conditions.\n\n# Impacts on most affected areas\n\n## Ohio\n\nOhio was one of the states most severely affected by the Great Snowstorm of 1944. The storm brought heavy snowfall and high winds to the entire state, with drifts reaching up to 20 feet in some areas. The Ohio Turnpike, a major transportation artery, was closed due to the hazardous conditions, stranding thousands of travelers.\n\nThe city of Cleveland was particularly hard hit, with snowfall totals reaching up to 30 inches. The city's airport was closed, and the streets were impassable, with many residents forced to abandon their vehicles and seek shelter elsewhere.\n\n## Pennsylvania\n\nPennsylvania was also severely affected by the Great Snowstorm of 1944, with widespread disruptions reported across the state. The storm brought heavy snowfall and high winds, causing significant drifting and blowing snow.\n\n### Erie\n\nThe city of Erie, located in northwestern Pennsylvania, was one of the hardest hit areas in the state. The storm brought sustained winds of up to 50 mph and snowfall totals of over 30 inches, causing widespread power outages and property damage.\n\n### Pittsburgh\n\nThe city of Pittsburgh, located in western Pennsylvania, was also severely affected by the storm. The city's airport was closed, and the streets were impassable, with many residents forced to seek shelter elsewhere.\n\n## West Virginia\n\nWest Virginia was another state severely affected by the Great Snowstorm of 1944. The storm brought heavy snowfall and high winds, causing significant disruptions to transportation and daily life.\n\nThe city of Charleston, the state capital, was particularly hard hit, with snowfall totals reaching up to 20 inches. The city's airport was closed, and the streets were impassable, with many residents forced to abandon their vehicles and seek shelter elsewhere.\n\n## New York\n\nNew York was also affected by the Great Snowstorm of 1944, with widespread disruptions reported across the state. The storm brought heavy snowfall and high winds, causing significant drifting and blowing snow.\n\n### Rochester\n\nThe city of Rochester, located in western New York, was one of the hardest hit areas in the state. The storm brought sustained winds of up to 40 mph and snowfall totals of over 20 inches, causing widespread power outages and property damage.\n\n## Ontario\n\nOntario, Canada, was also severely affected by the Great Snowstorm of 1944. The storm brought heavy snowfall and high winds, causing significant disruptions to transportation and daily life.\n\n### Toronto\n\nThe city of Toronto, the provincial capital, was particularly hard hit, with snowfall totals reaching up to 20 inches. The city's airport was closed, and the streets were impassable, with many residents forced to seek shelter elsewhere.\n\n### Hamilton and Niagara\n\nThe cities of Hamilton and Niagara, located in southern Ontario, were also severely affected by the storm. The storm brought heavy snowfall and high winds, causing significant disruptions to transportation and daily life.\n\n## Quebec\n\nQuebec, Canada, was also affected by the Great Snowstorm of 1944, with widespread disruptions reported across the province. The storm brought heavy snowfall and high winds, causing significant drifting and blowing snow.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of blizzards\n* Great Blizzard of 1888\n* Great Lakes Blizzard of 1977\n* Blizzard of 1993\n\n# References\n\n(To be added)\n\n# Notes\n\n(To be added)\n\n# External links\n\n(To be added)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Great_Snowstorm_of_1944\" following this outline:\n\n#Meteorological history\n#Overall impact\n#Fatalities and injuries\n#Impacts on most affected areas\n##Ohio\n##Pennsylvania\n###Erie\n###Pittsburgh\n##West Virginia\n##New York\n###Rochester\n##Ontario\n###Toronto\n###Hamilton and Niagara\n##Quebec\n#See also\n#References\n#Notes\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The blockade has resulted in a humanitarian crisis, with the region's population facing severe shortages of food, medicine, and other essential supplies.\n\n# Background\n\n## First blockade (1989–2023) and isolation from Armenia (1989–1992)\n\nThe first blockade of Nagorno-Karabakh began in 1989, during the dissolution of the Soviet Union, when the region declared independence from Azerbaijan. The blockade was imposed by Azerbaijan, with the support of Turkey, and resulted in the isolation of Nagorno-Karabakh from Armenia, its primary economic and cultural partner. The blockade was partially lifted in 1992, after the signing of the Bishkek Protocol, which established a ceasefire between Armenia and Azerbaijan.\n\n## Threats to public utility infrastructure and entry\n\nIn the years following the signing of the Bishkek Protocol, there were repeated threats to the public utility infrastructure and entry points of Nagorno-Karabakh. The region's main road, the Lachin corridor, which connects Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia, has been subject to repeated closures and blockades, resulting in shortages of food and medicine.\n\n## Prelude\n\nIn the years leading up to the current blockade, there were increasing tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan, particularly following the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war. The war resulted in significant losses for Armenia and the displacement of thousands of people from Nagorno-Karabakh. The current blockade is seen by many as an attempt by Azerbaijan to exert control over the region and to pressure Armenia into making concessions.\n\n# Blockade timeline\n\n## 2022 events\n\nThe current blockade of Nagorno-Karabakh began on December 12, 2022, when a group of Azerbaijani protesters, claiming to be environmental activists, blocked the Lachin corridor, the main road connecting Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia. The protesters claimed that they were protesting against the alleged exploitation of natural resources in the region by Armenia.\n\n## 2023 events\n\nIn January 2023, the blockade was reinforced by Azerbaijani police and military forces, who set up checkpoints and restricted the movement of people and goods into and out of Nagorno-Karabakh. The blockade has resulted in severe shortages of food, medicine, and other essential supplies, with the region's population facing a humanitarian crisis.\n\n# Humanitarian crisis\n\n## Lack of access to supplies and medical care\n\nThe blockade has resulted in a severe shortage of food, medicine, and other essential supplies in Nagorno-Karabakh. The region's population, which is largely dependent on imports from Armenia, is facing a humanitarian crisis, with many people unable to access basic necessities such as food and medicine.\n\n### Limited supplies transported by the Red Cross and the Russian peacekeepers\n\nDespite the efforts of the Red Cross and Russian peacekeepers to transport limited supplies into Nagorno-Karabakh, the blockade has resulted in a significant shortage of essential goods. The Russian peacekeepers, who have been deployed in the region since the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war, have been unable to effectively address the humanitarian crisis.\n\n## Damage to infrastructure\n\nThe blockade has also resulted in significant damage to the region's infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and public buildings. The lack of access to essential supplies has resulted in a decline in the region's economy, with many businesses forced to close.\n\n# Genocide risk factors\n\nThe blockade of Nagorno-Karabakh has raised concerns about the risk of genocide, with many experts warning that the humanitarian crisis could lead to a catastrophic outcome for the region's population. The blockade has resulted in a severe shortage of food, medicine, and other essential supplies, which could lead to a significant increase in mortality rates.\n\n# Inaction of the Russian peacekeepers\n\nThe inaction of the Russian peacekeepers has been widely criticized, with many experts arguing that they have failed to effectively address the humanitarian crisis in Nagorno-Karabakh. The Russian peacekeepers have been deployed in the region since the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war, but have been unable to prevent the blockade or provide adequate assistance to the region's population.\n\n# Proposed solutions\n\nSeveral proposed solutions have been put forward to address the humanitarian crisis in Nagorno-Karabakh, including the establishment of a humanitarian corridor to allow for the transportation of essential supplies into the region. However, these proposals have been met with resistance from Azerbaijan, which has insisted that the blockade will remain in place until its demands are met.\n\n# Authenticity of the environmental activism claims\n\nThe authenticity of the environmental activism claims made by the Azerbaijani protesters has been widely questioned, with many experts arguing that the blockade is a pretext for Azerbaijan to exert control over the region.\n\n## Involvement of the Azerbaijani government\n\nThere are concerns that the Azerbaijani government is involved in the blockade, with some experts arguing that the protesters are being supported and funded by the government.\n\n## Involvement of state employees and civil servants\n\nThere are also concerns that state employees and civil servants are involved in the blockade, with some reports suggesting that they are being forced to participate in the protests.\n\n## Inaccessibility of Nagorno-Karabakh to the public and independent journalists\n\nThe inaccessibility of Nagorno-Karabakh to the public and independent journalists has made it difficult to verify the authenticity of the environmental activism claims, with many experts arguing that the blockade is a pretext for Azerbaijan to exert control over the region.\n\n## Scrutiny of the \"protesters\" and their alleged environmental concerns\n\nThe \"protesters\" and their alleged environmental concerns have been subject to scrutiny, with many experts arguing that their claims are unfounded and that the blockade is a pretext for Azerbaijan to exert control over the region.\n\n# Lawsuits\n\nSeveral lawsuits have been filed in relation to the blockade of Nagorno-Karabakh, including a lawsuit filed by Armenia against Azerbaijan at the International Court of Justice.\n\n## International Court of Justice\n\nThe lawsuit filed by Armenia against Azerbaijan at the International Court of Justice alleges that Azerbaijan has breached its obligations under international law, including the prohibition on the use of force and the protection of human rights.\n\n## European Court of Human Rights\n\nA lawsuit has also been filed at the European Court of Human Rights, alleging that Azerbaijan has breached its obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights, including the right to life and the prohibition on torture.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## Involved parties\n\nThe involved parties, including Armenia and Azerbaijan, have made statements in relation to the blockade, with Armenia condemning the blockade and Azerbaijan insisting that it will remain in place until its demands are met.\n\n## International\n\nThe international community has condemned the blockade, with many countries and organizations calling for a peaceful resolution to the conflict.\n\n## Supranational\n\nSupranational organizations, including the European Union and the United Nations, have made statements in relation to the blockade, calling for a peaceful resolution to the conflict.\n\n## Non-governmental organizations\n\nNon-governmental organizations, including human rights groups and humanitarian organizations, have condemned the blockade and called for a peaceful resolution to the conflict.\n\n# See also\n\n* Nagorno-Karabakh conflict\n* 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war\n* Armenia-Azerbaijan relations\n* Humanitarian crisis\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a general overview of the blockade of Nagorno-Karabakh.

Known for their distinctive white coat and massive size, polar bears are a symbol of the Arctic and its harsh, icy environment. These majestic creatures have adapted to their surroundings in remarkable ways, developing unique characteristics and behaviors that enable them to thrive in one of the most inhospitable regions on the planet.\n\n# Naming\n\nThe name \"polar bear\" is a translation of the Norwegian word \"isbjørn,\" which means \"ice bear.\" The scientific name, Ursus maritimus, is derived from the Latin words \"ursus,\" meaning bear, and \"maritimus,\" meaning of the sea. The polar bear is also known as the Arctic bear, white bear, or sea bear.\n\n# Taxonomy\n\n## Evolution\n\nPolar bears are members of the Ursidae family, which includes all bears. They are most closely related to brown bears (Ursus arctos) and are thought to have shared a common ancestor with them around 200,000 years ago. Over time, the polar bear evolved from a smaller, more omnivorous species into the large, carnivorous animal we know today.\n\nThe earliest known fossils of polar bears date back to the Pleistocene era, around 100,000 years ago. Since then, the species has undergone significant changes in response to its environment. For example, the polar bear's white coat is an adaptation to its snowy and icy surroundings, helping it to blend in and sneak up on prey.\n\n# Characteristics\n\nPolar bears are massive animals, with adult males weighing up to 1,700 pounds (770 kg) and reaching lengths of up to 9 feet (2.7 meters). They have a stocky build and a short, rounded head, with a distinctive hump on their shoulders. Their fur is white and double-layered, consisting of a thick undercoat and a longer, guard hair layer. This fur helps to keep them warm in freezing temperatures and also provides camouflage in their snowy environment.\n\nPolar bears have large paws, with five toes and non-retractable claws. Their paws act as snowshoes, allowing them to move easily across the snow and ice. They are also excellent swimmers, using their powerful front paws to propel themselves through the water.\n\n# Distribution and habitat\n\nPolar bears are found in the Arctic Circle, including Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Norway, and Russia. They inhabit areas with sea ice, which they use as a platform to hunt and feed. In the summer, when the sea ice melts, polar bears are forced to swim or move onto land, where they may have limited access to food.\n\nPolar bears prefer areas with dense sea ice, as this provides them with the best hunting opportunities. They are also found in areas with ice floes, which are large chunks of ice that have broken off from the main ice sheet.\n\n# Behaviour and ecology\n\n## Social life\n\nPolar bears are generally solitary animals, only coming together to mate or to feed on a carcass. They have a large home range, which they mark with their scent to keep other bears away. Female polar bears are more social than males and have been known to form small family groups.\n\n## Diet and hunting\n\nPolar bears are carnivores and primarily feed on ringed seals (Pusa hispida), which are their main source of nutrition. They also feed on other marine mammals, such as bearded seals (Erignathus barbatus) and walruses (Odobenus rosmarus). In the summer, when sea ice is scarce, polar bears may feed on berries, lichens, and other plants.\n\nPolar bears are skilled hunters, using their keen sense of smell to locate their prey. They can sniff out a seal breathing hole in the ice from over a mile away. Once they have located their prey, they use their powerful claws and strength to kill it.\n\n## Reproduction and development\n\nFemale polar bears typically give birth to two cubs, which are born blind and helpless. The cubs are born in the winter, when the mother is in her den, and are nursed by her for several months. The mother teaches the cubs how to hunt and feed, and they remain with her for about two years.\n\n## Mortality\n\nPolar bears have a relatively high mortality rate, especially among cubs and subadults. The main causes of mortality are starvation, drowning, and human-caused deaths, such as hunting and trapping.\n\n# Conservation status\n\nPolar bears are listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, due to the impacts of climate change on their sea ice habitat. The global polar bear population is estimated to be around 22,000-31,000 individuals, with some subpopulations declining due to habitat loss and fragmentation.\n\n# Relationship with humans\n\n## Exploitation\n\nPolar bears have been hunted for their fur, meat, and body parts, which are used in traditional medicine. In some areas, polar bears are also hunted for sport. The hunting of polar bears is regulated by international law, but some countries still allow it.\n\n## Conflicts\n\nAs the sea ice melts, polar bears are coming into contact with humans more frequently, leading to conflicts. Polar bears may attack humans if they feel threatened or if they are protecting their young. In some areas, polar bears are also raiding human trash and food sources, leading to conflicts.\n\n## Captivity\n\nPolar bears are kept in captivity in zoos and aquariums, where they are used for education and conservation purposes. In captivity, polar bears are provided with a controlled environment and a diet of meat and fish.\n\n## Cultural significance\n\nPolar bears have significant cultural and symbolic meaning in many societies. They are often seen as a symbol of strength, courage, and resilience. In some cultures, polar bears are also associated with spiritual and mystical powers.\n\n# See also\n\n* Arctic fox\n* Brown bear\n* Climate change\n* Endangered species\n* Marine mammal\n* Sea ice\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is based on general knowledge and does not include specific references or citations.\n\n# References\n\n* None\n\n# Bibliography\n\n* None\n\n# External links\n\n* Polar Bear International\n* World Wildlife Fund: Polar Bear\n* National Geographic: Polar Bear", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Polar_bear\" following this outline:\n\n#Naming\n#Taxonomy\n##Evolution\n#Characteristics\n#Distribution and habitat\n#Behaviour and ecology\n##Social life\n##Diet and hunting\n##Reproduction and development\n##Mortality\n#Conservation status\n#Relationship with humans\n##Exploitation\n##Conflicts\n##Captivity\n##Cultural significance\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
