The case, which is being prosecuted by the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, centers on allegations of falsifying business records and other financial crimes related to Trump's dealings with adult film actress Stormy Daniels.\n\n# Background\n\n## Stormy Daniels–Donald Trump scandal\n\nIn 2006, Donald Trump allegedly had an affair with adult film actress Stormy Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford. Trump denied the affair, but in 2016, just before the presidential election, Daniels was paid $130,000 by Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, to keep quiet about the alleged affair. This payment was made through a shell company called Essential Consultants, LLC, which was established by Cohen for this purpose.\n\n## Manhattan DA investigation and grand jury\n\nIn 2019, the Manhattan District Attorney's Office (DANY) launched an investigation into Trump's dealings with Daniels and the payment made to her. The investigation was led by District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. and focused on potential crimes such as falsifying business records and violating campaign finance laws.\n\nIn August 2022, a grand jury was convened to hear evidence in the case. The grand jury was tasked with determining whether there was enough evidence to indict Trump on charges related to the payment to Daniels.\n\n## Eligibility for president\n\nSome have questioned whether a conviction in this case would affect Trump's eligibility to run for president again in the future. However, most experts agree that a state-level conviction would not automatically disqualify Trump from running for federal office.\n\n# Initial proceedings\n\n## Indictment and charges\n\nOn March 30, 2023, Trump was indicted by the grand jury on charges of falsifying business records in the first degree, a Class E felony. The indictment alleged that Trump had directed Michael Cohen to make the payment to Daniels and then falsely recorded the payment as a legal expense in his company's books.\n\n## Arraignment\n\nTrump was arraigned on April 4, 2023, and pleaded not guilty to the charges. He was released on his own recognizance and ordered to return to court for a pre-trial conference.\n\n# Pre-trial proceedings\n\n## Request for indictment dismissal\n\nIn April 2023, Trump's lawyers filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, arguing that the charges were politically motivated and that the prosecution had presented insufficient evidence to the grand jury. The motion was denied by the court.\n\n## Discovery materials and witnesses\n\nIn May 2023, the prosecution turned over discovery materials to Trump's lawyers, including documents and witness statements related to the case. The materials included testimony from several key witnesses, including Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels.\n\n## Requests for recusal\n\nIn June 2023, Trump's lawyers filed a motion to recuse the judge presiding over the case, arguing that he had made biased comments about Trump in the past. The motion was denied by the court.\n\n## Request for removal to federal court\n\nIn July 2023, Trump's lawyers filed a motion to remove the case to federal court, arguing that the charges were related to federal campaign finance laws. The motion was denied by the court.\n\n## Trial scheduling\n\nIn August 2023, the court scheduled the trial to begin on October 2, 2023.\n\n## Gag order\n\nIn September 2023, the court issued a gag order, prohibiting Trump and his lawyers from making public statements about the case.\n\n## Statute of limitations\n\nSome have questioned whether the statute of limitations has expired on the charges against Trump. However, the prosecution has argued that the statute of limitations was tolled due to Trump's alleged concealment of the crime.\n\n# Overview of witnesses\n\nThe prosecution is expected to call several key witnesses in the case, including:\n\n* Michael Cohen\n* Stormy Daniels\n* Keith Davidson, a lawyer who represented Daniels in her negotiations with Trump\n* Hope Hicks, a former Trump aide\n* David Pecker, the CEO of American Media, Inc., which published the National Enquirer\n\n# Trial\n\n## Jury selection and opening statements\n\nThe trial began on October 2, 2023, with jury selection.

It is the largest and most powerful space telescope ever built, designed to conduct infrared astronomy in a wide range of wavelengths. The JWST is named after James E. Webb, the second administrator of NASA, and is considered the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\n# Features\n\n## Location and orbit\n\nThe JWST is located in the second Lagrange point (L2), approximately 1.5 million kilometers from Earth. This location allows the telescope to maintain a stable temperature of around -240°C, which is necessary for its sensitive instruments to function. The L2 point also provides a stable gravitational environment, which minimizes the need for course corrections.\n\n## Sunshield protection\n\nThe JWST has a large sunshield that protects its instruments from the heat and light of the Sun. The sunshield is made of five layers of a material called Kapton, which is designed to reflect sunlight and keep the telescope cool. The sunshield is deployed in space and is critical to the operation of the JWST.\n\n## Optics\n\nThe JWST has a 6.5-meter primary mirror that is made of 18 hexagonal segments. The mirror is made of beryllium, which is a lightweight and rigid material that is ideal for space telescopes. The mirror is designed to collect and focus infrared radiation, which is then detected by the JWST's instruments.\n\n## Scientific instruments\n\nThe JWST has four scientific instruments that are designed to conduct a wide range of astronomical observations. These instruments include the Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam), the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec), the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI), and the Fine Guidance Sensor (FGS). Each instrument is designed to study different wavelengths of infrared radiation and to conduct different types of observations.\n\n## Spacecraft bus\n\nThe JWST spacecraft bus is the main structure of the telescope, which includes the power and communication systems. The bus is designed to provide power to the JWST's instruments and to communicate with Earth via radio signals. The bus also includes the attitude control system, which is used to point the JWST at its targets.\n\n## Servicing\n\nThe JWST is not designed to be serviced by astronauts, unlike the Hubble Space Telescope. However, the JWST does have a limited capability for remote servicing, which allows NASA to update its software and to make minor repairs.\n\n## Software\n\nThe JWST software is designed to control the telescope's instruments and to process its data. The software includes the telescope's operating system, which is called the JWST Flight Software. The software also includes the data processing algorithms, which are used to analyze the JWST's observations.\n\n# Comparison with other telescopes\n\nThe JWST is the largest and most powerful space telescope ever built, with a primary mirror that is 6.5 meters in diameter. In comparison, the Hubble Space Telescope has a primary mirror that is 2.4 meters in diameter. The JWST is also more sensitive than the Hubble Space Telescope, with a sensitivity that is 10-100 times greater. The JWST is designed to conduct infrared astronomy, whereas the Hubble Space Telescope is designed to conduct visible and ultraviolet astronomy.\n\n# Development history\n\n## Background (development to 2003)\n\nThe JWST was first proposed in the 1990s as a successor to the Hubble Space Telescope. The JWST was designed to conduct infrared astronomy, which was a new and rapidly developing field at the time. The JWST was also designed to be more powerful and more sensitive than the Hubble Space Telescope, with a primary mirror that was 6.5 meters in diameter.\n\n## Early development and replanning (2003–2007)\n\nThe JWST was officially approved by NASA in 2003, with a planned launch date of 2011. However, the JWST experienced significant delays and cost overruns, which led to a replanning of the project. The JWST's primary mirror was redesigned to be made of 18 hexagonal segments, which reduced its weight and cost.\n\n## Detailed design and construction (2007–2021)\n\nThe JWST's detailed design and construction phase began in 2007. The JWST's instruments were designed and built by NASA and its partners, including the ESA and the CSA. The JWST's spacecraft bus was also designed and built during this phase, including its power and communication systems.\n\n## Cost and schedule issues\n\nThe JWST experienced significant cost and schedule issues during its development. The JWST's cost increased from an initial estimate of $3.5 billion to a final estimate of $8.7 billion. The JWST's launch date was also delayed several times, from an initial date of 2011 to a final date of 2021.\n\n## Partnership\n\nThe JWST is a partnership between NASA, the ESA, and the CSA. The ESA provided the JWST's Ariane 5 rocket, which was used to launch the JWST into space. The CSA provided the JWST's Fine Guidance Sensor, which is used to point the JWST at its targets.\n\n## Naming concerns\n\nThe JWST was named after James E. Webb, the second administrator of NASA. However, some astronomers and scientists have raised concerns about the JWST's name, citing Webb's role in the Lavender Scare, a period of persecution of LGBTQ individuals in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\n# Mission goals\n\n## Orbit design\n\nThe JWST's orbit is designed to be stable and long-lasting, with a minimum lifetime of 5 years. The JWST's orbit is also designed to be thermally stable, with a temperature that is maintained at around -240°C.\n\n## Infrared astronomy\n\nThe JWST is designed to conduct infrared astronomy, which is a rapidly developing field. The JWST's instruments are designed to study the infrared radiation that is emitted by stars, galaxies, and other celestial objects.\n\n# Ground support and operations\n\n## Micrometeoroid strike\n\nThe JWST experienced a micrometeoroid strike in May 2022, which damaged one of its mirrors. However, the JWST's instruments were not affected, and the telescope was able to continue its observations.\n\n# From launch through commissioning\n\n## Launch\n\nThe JWST was launched on December 25, 2021, aboard an Ariane 5 rocket. The JWST was launched from the Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana.\n\n## Transit and structural deployment\n\nThe JWST traveled to its final orbit over the course of several weeks, during which time it deployed its sunshield and its primary mirror. The JWST's sunshield was deployed on December 28, 2021, and its primary mirror was deployed on January 8, 2022.\n\n## Commissioning and testing\n\nThe JWST began its commissioning and testing phase in January 2022. The JWST's instruments were turned on and tested, and the telescope's pointing and tracking systems were calibrated.\n\n# Allocation of observation time\n\n## Early Release Science program\n\nThe JWST's Early Release Science program was designed to provide a limited amount of observation time to astronomers and scientists. The program was designed to demonstrate the JWST's capabilities and to provide a test of its instruments.\n\n## General Observer Program\n\nThe JWST's General Observer Program is designed to provide observation time to astronomers and scientists on a competitive basis. The program is designed to support a wide range of scientific research, including the study of stars, galaxies, and other celestial objects.\n\n# Scientific results\n\n## First full-color images\n\nThe JWST released its first full-color images on July 11, 2022. The images showed the galaxy cluster SMACS 0723, the gas giant Jupiter, and the binary star system 2M1207-39.\n\n## Bright early galaxies\n\nThe JWST has discovered several bright early galaxies, which are galaxies that are seen as they were in the distant past. The JWST's observations have provided new insights into the formation and evolution of galaxies in the early universe.\n\n## Subsequent noteworthy observations and interpretations\n\nThe JWST has made several subsequent noteworthy observations and interpretations, including the detection of water vapor in the atmosphere of a distant exoplanet and the study of the formation of stars and galaxies in the early universe.\n\n## Gallery\n\n* First full-color image of SMACS 0723\n* First full-color image of Jupiter\n* First full-color image of 2M1207-39\n\n# See also\n\n* Hubble Space Telescope\n* Spitzer Space Telescope\n* Kepler Space Telescope\n* Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS)\n\n# Notes\n\n# References\n\n# Further reading\n\n# External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"James_Webb_Space_Telescope\" following this outline:\n\n#Features\n##Location and orbit\n##Sunshield protection\n##Optics\n##Scientific instruments\n##Spacecraft bus\n##Servicing\n##Software\n#Comparison with other telescopes\n#Development history\n##Background (development to 2003)\n##Early development and replanning (2003–2007)\n##Detailed design and construction (2007–2021)\n##Cost and schedule issues\n##Partnership\n##Naming concerns\n#Mission goals\n##Orbit design\n##Infrared astronomy\n#Ground support and operations\n##Micrometeoroid strike\n#From launch through commissioning\n##Launch\n##Transit and structural deployment\n##Commissioning and testing\n#Allocation of observation time\n##Early Release Science program\n##General Observer Program\n#Scientific results\n##First full-color images\n##Bright early galaxies\n##Subsequent noteworthy observations and interpretations\n##Gallery\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The film is based on the true story of the Agojie, an all-female military unit of the Dahomey Kingdom in West Africa during the 19th century.\n\n#Plot\n\nThe film takes place in the 1820s, during the reign of King Ghezo of Dahomey. The kingdom is under threat from neighboring tribes and European colonizers, who seek to exploit the region's rich resources. General Nanisca, a seasoned warrior and leader of the Agojie, trains a new generation of recruits to join the elite fighting force. The story follows Nawi, a young and fiercely independent girl who is forced to flee her home after being rejected by her father. Nawi is taken in by the Agojie and undergoes rigorous training under Nanisca's guidance.\n\nAs Nawi grows in strength and skill, she becomes embroiled in the kingdom's politics and battles against external threats. Alongside Nanisca and the Agojie, Nawi fights to protect her new family and the kingdom from those who seek to destroy it. The film's plot is driven by themes of female empowerment, sisterhood, and the struggle for independence and self-determination.\n\n#Cast\n\nThe film features a diverse and talented cast, including:\n\n* Viola Davis as General Nanisca\n* Thuso Mbedu as Nawi\n* Lashana Lynch as Izogie\n* Sheila Atim as Amenza\n* Hero Fiennes-Tiffin as Santo Ferreira\n* John Boyega as King Ghezo\n\n#Production\n\n##Development\n\nThe Woman King was in development for several years, with various scripts and directors attached to the project. Gina Prince-Bythewood was eventually brought on board to direct, and she worked closely with writer Dana Stevens to develop the screenplay. The film was produced by Cathy Schulman, Viola Davis, and Julius Tennon, with eOne and TriStar Pictures serving as co-producers.\n\n##Filming\n\nPrincipal photography took place in South Africa over a period of several months. The film's cinematography was handled by Polly Morgan, who worked closely with Prince-Bythewood to capture the lush landscapes and vibrant culture of West Africa. The film's action sequences were choreographed by stunt coordinator, Danny Hernandez.\n\n##Post-production\n\nPost-production on the film took place in Los Angeles, with editor Terilyn A. Shropshire working closely with Prince-Bythewood to shape the film's narrative and tone. The film's score was composed by Terence Blanchard, who incorporated traditional West African music and instrumentation into the soundtrack.\n\n#Release\n\nThe Woman King was released in theaters on September 16, 2022, by Sony Pictures Releasing. The film received a wide release, playing in over 3,000 theaters across the United States. The film also screened at various film festivals, including the Toronto International Film Festival and the African Diaspora International Film Festival.\n\n#Reception\n\n##Box office\n\nThe Woman King was a commercial success, grossing over $100 million worldwide. The film performed particularly well in the United States, where it grossed over $70 million in its opening weekend.\n\n##Critical response\n\nThe Woman King received widespread critical acclaim, with many praising the film's performances, direction, and cultural significance. The film holds a 94% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on over 200 reviews. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 87 out of 100, based on over 50 reviews.\n\n##Accolades\n\nThe Woman King received numerous awards and nominations, including several Academy Award nominations. The film won several NAACP Image Awards, including Outstanding Motion Picture and Outstanding Actress in a Motion Picture for Viola Davis.\n\n#Historical accuracy\n\nThe Woman King is based on the true story of the Agojie, an all-female military unit of the Dahomey Kingdom in West Africa during the 19th century. While the film takes some creative liberties with the events and characters, it is largely accurate in its portrayal of the Agojie and their role in the kingdom's history.\n\n##Characters\n\nThe film's characters are based on real historical figures, including General Nanisca and King Ghezo. The character of Nawi is fictional, but her story is inspired by the experiences of many women who joined the Agojie.\n\n##Role in slavery\n\nThe Dahomey Kingdom was involved in the transatlantic slave trade, and the Agojie played a role in the kingdom's slave raids and trading activities. The film acknowledges this aspect of the kingdom's history, but also highlights the Agojie's resistance to European colonization and their fight for independence and self-determination.\n\n#Controversy\n\nThe Woman King has been the subject of some controversy, with some critics accusing the film of glossing over the Dahomey Kingdom's involvement in the slave trade. Others have criticized the film's portrayal of African culture and history, arguing that it reinforces stereotypes and perpetuates a Eurocentric view of the continent.\n\n#Notes\n\nThe Woman King is a powerful and timely film that celebrates the strength and resilience of African women. While it takes some creative liberties with the events and characters, it is largely accurate in its portrayal of the Agojie and their role in the kingdom's history.\n\n#References\n\nThis article does not include any references or citations.\n\n#Further reading\n\nFor further reading on the Agojie and the Dahomey Kingdom, see:\n\n* Stanley B.

This concept has been explored by numerous composers throughout history, resulting in a diverse range of works that showcase their technical skill, creativity, and understanding of harmony and tonality.\n\n#Notable Sets that Cover All 24 Keys\n\nSeveral composers have written notable sets that cover all 24 keys, often in the form of a collection of preludes, fugues, or etudes. These sets are remarkable for their technical complexity, musicality, and historical significance.\n\n##Composers Who Wrote Multiple Sets\n\nSome composers have written multiple sets of pieces covering all 24 keys. For example, Johann Sebastian Bach wrote two sets of preludes and fugues, known as \"The Well-Tempered Clavier,\" Books I and II. Similarly, Dmitri Shostakovich wrote two sets of preludes, Op. 34 and Op. 87, each covering all 24 keys.\n\n#Variants\n\nWhile many sets of pieces cover all 24 keys, there are also variants that explore different aspects of tonality and harmony.\n\n##Single Pieces that Modulate Through Many Keys\n\nSome composers have written single pieces that modulate through many keys, often creating a sense of tonal ambiguity or uncertainty. For example, Franz Liszt's \"La Campanella\" is a etude that modulates through numerous keys, creating a sense of virtuosic display and technical complexity.\n\n##Works Covering All Eight Church Modes\n\nIn addition to works covering all 24 major and minor keys, some composers have written pieces that explore all eight church modes. For example, Olivier Messiaen's \"Modes de Valeur\" is a set of pieces that covers all eight church modes, creating a sense of modal experimentation and innovation.\n\n##Other Sets of 24 Pieces\n\nWhile many sets of pieces cover all 24 major and minor keys, there are also other sets that explore different aspects of tonality and harmony. For example, Igor Stravinsky's \"The Firebird\" is a ballet that features a set of 24 pieces, each based on a different folk melody or theme.\n\n#Keys\n\nThe order of keys in published works can vary, but there are some common patterns and conventions.\n\n##Order of Keys in Published Works\n\nIn many published works, the order of keys follows a specific pattern or convention. For example, in Bach's \"The Well-Tempered Clavier,\" the order of keys is based on the circle of fifths, with each key progressing in a clockwise direction. In other works, the order of keys may be based on the composer's personal preference or creative vision.\n\n#History\n\nThe concept of music written in all major or minor keys has a rich and complex history, spanning centuries and numerous composers.\n\n##Bach and His Precursors\n\nJohann Sebastian Bach is often credited with perfecting the art of writing music in all major or minor keys. However, there were many precursors to Bach who also explored this concept. For example, Frescobaldi wrote a set of toccatas and partitas that covered all 24 keys, and Sweelinck wrote a set of fantasias that explored all 24 keys.\n\n##After Bach\n\nAfter Bach, the concept of music written in all major or minor keys continued to evolve and develop.\n\n###18th and 19th Centuries\n\n####1750–1850\n\nDuring the 18th and 19th centuries, many composers wrote sets of pieces that covered all 24 keys. For example, Haydn wrote a set of sonatas that explored all 24 keys, and Beethoven wrote a set of bagatelles that covered all 24 keys.\n\n####1851–1900\n\nIn the late 19th century, the concept of music written in all major or minor keys continued to evolve and develop. For example, Brahms wrote a set of intermezzos that explored all 24 keys, and Chopin wrote a set of nocturnes that covered all 24 keys.\n\n###20th Century\n\n####1901–1950\n\nIn the 20th century, the concept of music written in all major or minor keys continued to evolve and develop. For example, Schoenberg wrote a set of pieces for solo piano that explored all 24 keys, and Stravinsky wrote a set of etudes that covered all 24 keys.\n\n####1951–2000\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century, the concept of music written in all major or minor keys continued to evolve and develop. For example, Messiaen wrote a set of modes de valeur that explored all 24 keys, and Boulez wrote a set of pieces for solo piano that covered all 24 keys.\n\n###21st Century\n\nIn the 21st century, the concept of music written in all major or minor keys continues to evolve and develop. For example, many contemporary composers have written sets of pieces that explore all 24 keys, often using new and innovative techniques and technologies.\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article has provided an overview of music written in all major or minor keys, including notable sets that cover all 24 keys, variants, and the history of this concept.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Music_written_in_all_major_or_minor_keys\" following this outline:\n\n#Notable sets that cover all 24 keys\n##Composers who wrote multiple sets\n#Variants\n##Single pieces that modulate through many keys\n##Works covering all eight church modes\n##Other sets of 24 pieces\n#Keys\n##Order of keys in published works\n#History\n##Bach and his precursors\n##After Bach\n###18th and 19th centuries\n####1750–1850\n####1851–1900\n###20th century\n####1901–1950\n####1951–2000\n###21st century\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He is a six-time Olympic gold medalist and is widely regarded as one of the greatest short track speed skaters of all time. An's career has been marked by numerous accolades, as well as controversy and conflict with the South Korean skating union and coaches.\n\nEarly Life and Education\n------------------------\n\nViktor An was born on November 23, 1985, in Seoul, South Korea. He began skating at the age of six and quickly emerged as a talented young athlete. An's early life was marked by intense training and dedication to his sport.\n\nCareer\n--------\n\n### 2000s\n\n#### Early Career and the 2002 Winter Olympics\n\nAn's early career was marked by rapid progression and success. He made his international debut at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, where he won a gold medal in the 1000m event and a bronze medal in the 5000m relay. An's success at the Olympics was a significant factor in his rise to prominence in the short track speed skating world.\n\n#### National Team 'Recommendation System'\n\nIn South Korea, the national team selection process is based on a \"recommendation system,\" where coaches and officials recommend athletes for selection to the national team. An's success at the Olympics led to him being recommended for the national team, and he quickly became a key member of the Korean team.\n\n### 2002–2005, KNSU and Non-KNSU\n\nBetween 2002 and 2005, An continued to compete at the highest level, winning numerous World Cup events and World Championships titles. However, his relationship with the Korea Skating Union (KNSU) began to deteriorate, and he faced criticism from coaches and officials.\n\n### 2005, Conflict with Korea Skating Union\n\nIn 2005, An's conflict with the KNSU came to a head. He was criticized by coaches and officials for his training methods and his decision to compete in non-KNSU events. An responded by stating that he felt stifled by the KNSU's rigid training system and that he needed to compete in other events to improve his skills.\n\n### 2006 Winter Olympics\n\nAt the 2006 Winter Olympics in Torino, An won two gold medals and one bronze medal. However, his success was marred by controversy, as he was involved in a collision with American skater Apolo Anton Ohno in the 5000m relay final.\n\n### After Torino\n\nAfter the 2006 Olympics, An's relationship with the KNSU continued to deteriorate. He faced criticism from coaches and officials, and he began to explore options for competing outside of the KNSU system.\n\n### Injury in Early 2008\n\nIn early 2008, An suffered a serious injury that kept him out of competition for several months. The injury was a significant setback, but An was determined to return to competition and continue his career.\n\n### 2010s\n\n#### 2010, Conflict with Korea Skating Union\n\nIn 2010, An's conflict with the KNSU reached a boiling point. He was involved in a dispute with coaches and officials over his training methods and his decision to compete in non-KNSU events. The dispute led to An being suspended from the national team, and he was forced to consider alternative options for continuing his career.\n\n#### Naturalization to Russia\n\nIn 2011, An announced that he would be naturalizing to Russia and competing for the Russian national team. The decision was a significant shock, as An had been a key member of the Korean team for many years.\n\n#### 2011, Conflict with the South Korean Coaches\n\nAn's decision to naturalize to Russia was met with criticism from South Korean coaches and officials. They accused him of being disloyal and of abandoning his country. An responded by stating that he had been forced out of the Korean team by the KNSU's rigid training system and that he needed to compete for Russia in order to continue his career.\n\n#### Heading to Sochi\n\nAt the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, An competed for the Russian national team and won three gold medals. His success was a significant factor in Russia's overall performance at the Olympics, and he was hailed as a hero by Russian fans.\n\n#### 2014 Winter Olympics\n\nAn's performance at the 2014 Olympics was one of the highlights of the Games. He won gold medals in the 500m, 1000m, and 5000m relay events, and he was widely praised for his dominance on the ice.\n\n#### After Sochi\n\nAfter the 2014 Olympics, An continued to compete at the highest level, winning numerous World Cup events and World Championships titles.

Ron Hubbard\n================\n\nLafayette Ronald Hubbard, more commonly known as L. Ron Hubbard, was an American author, philosopher, and the founder of the Church of Scientology. Born on March 13, 1911, in Tilden, Nebraska, Hubbard is best known for developing the self-help system called Dianetics, which later evolved into the Church of Scientology. His life was marked by a mix of literary success, military service, and the creation of a spiritual movement that has been the subject of controversy and scrutiny.\n\nLife\n=====\n\n### Before Dianetics\n\n#### Pre-war fiction\n\nHubbard's early life was marked by a love for writing and adventure. He began writing at an early age and was heavily influenced by the science fiction and fantasy authors of his time, such as H.G. Wells and Jules Verne. In the 1930s, Hubbard started writing for pulp magazines, publishing numerous short stories and novels in the science fiction and fantasy genres. Some of his notable works from this period include the novel \"Fear\" and the short story \"The Dangerous Dimension.\"\n\n#### Military career\n\nIn 1941, Hubbard joined the United States Navy, where he served during World War II. He was assigned to various posts, including the Philippines, Australia, and the United States. Hubbard's military career was marked by controversy, with some claims suggesting that he was injured in combat and others indicating that he was not. Despite this, Hubbard was awarded several medals, including the Purple Heart.\n\n#### After the war\n\nAfter the war, Hubbard returned to writing, but he became increasingly interested in the field of psychology and the human mind. He began to develop his own theories about the nature of consciousness and the human condition, which would eventually become the basis for Dianetics.\n\n### In the Dianetics era\n\nIn 1950, Hubbard published his book \"Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health,\" which introduced his concept of the \"reactive mind\" and the \"auditing\" process. The book was a commercial success, and Hubbard quickly became a prominent figure in the field of self-help and personal development. He established the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation, which offered auditing services and trained auditors in the Dianetics method.\n\n### Pivot to Scientology\n\nIn the early 1950s, Hubbard began to develop his ideas further, incorporating elements of science fiction, philosophy, and spirituality into his work. He introduced the concept of the \"thetan,\" a spiritual being that is trapped in the physical body, and developed the idea of the \"eight dynamics,\" which describe the different aspects of human existence. This marked the beginning of Scientology, which would eventually replace Dianetics as Hubbard's primary focus.\n\n### In the Church of Scientology era\n\nIn 1954, Hubbard established the first Church of Scientology in Los Angeles, California. The church quickly grew, and Hubbard became a charismatic leader, attracting thousands of followers. He established a hierarchical structure for the church, with himself at the top as the \"Source\" of Scientology. Hubbard also developed the concept of the \"Operating Thetan,\" a spiritual state that can be achieved through advanced auditing and training.\n\n### In the Sea Org era\n\nIn the late 1960s, Hubbard established the Sea Organization, a paramilitary group within the Church of Scientology. The Sea Org was responsible for managing the church's affairs and enforcing Hubbard's policies. Hubbard himself became increasingly reclusive, living on a ship called the Apollo, where he wrote and lectured on Scientology.\n\n### In hiding\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, Hubbard's health began to decline, and he became increasingly isolated. He lived in hiding, using various pseudonyms and disguises to avoid detection. Despite his poor health, Hubbard continued to write and dictate policies for the Church of Scientology until his death on January 24, 1986.\n\nSources and doctrines\n=====================\n\nHubbard's work draws on a wide range of sources, including science fiction, philosophy, psychology, and spirituality. He was influenced by authors such as Aleister Crowley, Sigmund Freud, and Carl Jung, and incorporated elements of their ideas into his own work. Hubbard's doctrines are based on his concept of the \"reactive mind\" and the \"thetan,\" and he developed a complex system of auditing and training to help individuals achieve spiritual enlightenment.\n\nFalse biographical claims\n=========================\n\nHubbard made several false claims about his life and achievements, including claims that he was a nuclear physicist, a war hero, and a graduate of George Washington University. These claims have been widely debunked, and Hubbard's actual life and achievements are significantly less impressive.\n\nLegacy\n=======\n\n### In Scientology\n\nHubbard's legacy within the Church of Scientology is immense. He is revered as the \"Source\" of Scientology, and his teachings are considered sacred. The church continues to use Hubbard's methods and materials, and his writings are considered authoritative.\n\n### In popular culture\n\nHubbard's influence can also be seen in popular culture, particularly in the fields of science fiction and fantasy. His ideas about the nature of consciousness and the human condition have influenced authors such as Philip K. Dick and Robert A. Heinlein. Hubbard's work has also been referenced in music, film, and television, often as a symbol of cultish or pseudoscientific thinking.\n\nSelect works\n=============\n\n* \"Fear\" (1940)\n* \"The Dangerous Dimension\" (1938)\n* \"Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health\" (1950)\n* \"Science of Survival\" (1951)\n* \"The Creation of Human Ability\" (1954)\n* \"Introduction to Scientology Ethics\" (1965)\n\nSee also\n=========\n\n* Church of Scientology\n* Dianetics\n* Sea Organization\n* Operating Thetan\n\nNotes\n=====\n\nReferences\n==========\n\nWorks cited\n===========\n\nFurther reading\n==============\n\nExternal links\n==============", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"L._Ron_Hubbard\" following this outline:\n\n#Life\n##Before Dianetics\n###Pre-war fiction\n###Military career\n###After the war\n##In the Dianetics era\n##Pivot to Scientology\n##In the Church of Scientology era\n##In the Sea Org era\n##In hiding\n#Sources and doctrines\n#False biographical claims\n#Legacy\n##In Scientology\n##In popular culture\n#Select works\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Works cited\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The reform aims to limit the power of the Israeli Supreme Court and give the government more control over the appointment of judges and the interpretation of laws. The proposed changes have sparked intense debate and controversy within Israel and internationally, with proponents arguing that the reform is necessary to restore balance to the Israeli system of government and opponents claiming that it would undermine democracy and the rule of law.\n\n#Background\n\n##Israeli Supreme Court and judicial review\n\nThe Israeli Supreme Court is the highest court in Israel, with the power to interpret laws and decide on their constitutionality. The court has played a significant role in shaping Israeli law and politics, often serving as a check on the power of the government. The court's ability to review and strike down laws has been a source of controversy, with some arguing that it oversteps its bounds and interferes with the democratic process.\n\n##1992 Constitutional Revolution and its discontents\n\nIn 1992, the Israeli Supreme Court, led by Chief Justice Aharon Barak, introduced a series of decisions that established the court as a powerful force in Israeli politics. The court's decisions, known as the \"Constitutional Revolution,\" held that the court had the power to review and strike down laws that it deemed unconstitutional. While the decisions were hailed by some as a victory for democracy and human rights, others saw them as an attempt by the court to impose its own vision on the country.\n\n##2018–2022 Israeli political crisis and 2022 legislative election\n\nIn 2018, Israel entered a period of political crisis, marked by a series of inconclusive elections and the inability of any party to form a stable government. The crisis was fueled by a series of corruption scandals, including one involving Prime Minister Netanyahu. In the 2022 legislative election, Netanyahu's Likud party won the most seats, but was unable to form a government without the support of other parties. The election marked a turning point in Israeli politics, with the newly formed government, led by Netanyahu, vowing to implement significant changes to the judicial system.\n\n#Legislative history\n\n##HCJ 5658/23 Movement for Quality Government in Israel v. Knesset (2024)\n\nIn response to the proposed reforms, a petition was filed with the Supreme Court, challenging the constitutionality of the amendments. The petition, filed by the Movement for Quality Government in Israel, argued that the reforms would undermine the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law. The court's decision, expected in 2024, will have significant implications for the future of the Israeli judicial system.\n\n#Proposed changes\n\n##Judicial selection\n\n###Current system\n\nUnder the current system, judges are selected by a nine-member committee, composed of three Supreme Court justices, two ministers, two members of the Knesset, and two representatives of the Israel Bar Association. The committee selects candidates based on their qualifications and experience.\n\n###Proposed system\n\nThe proposed reform would give the government more control over the appointment of judges, allowing it to nominate candidates without the approval of the Supreme Court. The reform would also reduce the number of Supreme Court justices on the selection committee.\n\n###Arguments in favor of the reform\n\nProponents of the reform argue that the current system is biased towards appointing judges who are out of touch with the views of the Israeli public. They claim that the reform would allow for the appointment of more diverse and representative judges.\n\n###Arguments against the reform\n\nOpponents of the reform argue that it would undermine the independence of the judiciary and allow the government to appoint judges who are loyal only to the ruling party. They claim that the reform would lead to a politicization of the judiciary and undermine the rule of law.\n\n##Government legal advisors\n\nThe proposed reform would give government ministers the power to appoint their own legal advisors, rather than relying on the Attorney-General. This would allow ministers to receive advice that is more in line with their own views, rather than being bound by the advice of the Attorney-General.\n\n##Constitutional review\n\nThe proposed reform would limit the power of the Supreme Court to review and strike down laws. The reform would establish a new process for reviewing laws, which would involve a panel of experts and would be more limited in scope than the current system.\n\n##Override clause\n\nThe proposed reform would introduce an \"override clause,\" which would allow the Knesset to override Supreme Court decisions with a majority of 61 votes. This would give the government more power to implement its policies, even if they are challenged by the court.\n\n##Abolition of \"unreasonableness\" grounds\n\nThe proposed reform would abolish the \"unreasonableness\" grounds for challenging laws, which have been used by the Supreme Court to strike down laws that it deems unreasonable or disproportionate.\n\n###Arguments in favor of the reform\n\nProponents of the reform argue that the \"unreasonableness\" grounds have been used too broadly by the court, and have led to the striking down of laws that are reasonable and necessary.\n\n###Arguments against the reform\n\nOpponents of the reform argue that the abolition of the \"unreasonableness\" grounds would undermine the ability of the court to protect individual rights and would lead to the implementation of arbitrary and unreasonable laws.\n\n##Status of the Attorney-General\n\nThe proposed reform would reduce the power of the Attorney-General, who would no longer have the authority to advise government ministers on legal matters. The Attorney-General would be limited to advising the government on matters of law and would not have the power to challenge government decisions.\n\n#Reactions\n\n##National\n\nThe proposed reforms have sparked intense debate within Israel, with proponents arguing that they are necessary to restore balance to the Israeli system of government and opponents claiming that they would undermine democracy and the rule of law.\n\n##International\n\nThe proposed reforms have also been criticized internationally, with many countries and organizations expressing concern about the impact on democracy and human rights.\n\n##Connection to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict\n\nThe proposed reforms have also been linked to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with some arguing that they would undermine the ability of the court to protect the rights of Palestinians and others claiming that they would help to promote a more just and equitable society.\n\n#Suspension and overruling\n\nThe proposed reforms have been suspended pending a decision by the Supreme Court, which is expected to rule on the constitutionality of the amendments. If the court rules that the reforms are unconstitutional, they may be overruled and the current system restored.\n\n#See also\n\n* Israeli Supreme Court\n* Israeli judicial system\n* Constitutional Revolution\n* 2022 Israeli legislative election\n\n#References\n\n*Note: This article does not include any citations or references, as per the requirements.\n\n#External links\n\n*Note: This article does not include any external links, as per the requirements.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Israeli_judicial_reform\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Israeli Supreme Court and judicial review\n##1992 Constitutional Revolution and its discontents\n##2018–2022 Israeli political crisis and 2022 legislative election\n#Legislative history\n##HCJ 5658/23 Movement for Quality Government in Israel v.

Women are also subject to discriminatory laws and practices, including restrictions on their ability to travel, work, and access education.\n\n## Protest movements under the Islamic Republic\n\nIran has a long history of protest movements, dating back to the 1990s, when students and intellectuals began to speak out against the regime's authoritarian policies. In 2009, mass protests broke out following the disputed presidential election, which saw the re-election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The protests, known as the Green Movement, were brutally suppressed by the government, resulting in the deaths of dozens of protesters and the imprisonment of hundreds more.\n\n## Mahsa Amini's arrest and death in custody\n\nMahsa Amini was arrested by Iran's morality police on September 13, 2022, for allegedly violating the country's strict dress code laws. She was taken to a police station in Tehran, where she was beaten and subjected to physical and psychological abuse. Amini fell into a coma and was taken to a hospital, where she died three days later. The government claimed that Amini had died of a heart attack, but her family and eyewitnesses disputed this account, saying that she had been severely beaten by the police.\n\n# Protests\n\n## Slogans and grievances\n\nProtesters in Iran have been chanting slogans calling for greater freedoms, an end to the country's strict dress code laws, and the overthrow of the Islamic Republic. Demonstrators have also been demanding justice for Mahsa Amini and other victims of police brutality. The protests have been marked by a sense of outrage and anger, with many Iranians feeling that the government is out of touch with their needs and aspirations.\n\n## Iranian public opinion\n\nThe protests have been widely supported by the Iranian public, with many people taking to social media to express their solidarity with the demonstrators. According to a recent survey, over 70% of Iranians support the protests, with many calling for greater freedoms and an end to the country's authoritarian policies.\n\n## Protest techniques\n\nProtesters in Iran have been using a range of tactics, including marching, chanting, and setting fire to government buildings and vehicles. Demonstrators have also been using social media to organize and coordinate their efforts, with many using encrypted messaging apps to communicate with each other.\n\n## Civil boycotts\n\nIn addition to the protests, many Iranians have been participating in civil boycotts, refusing to buy goods and services from companies that support the government. The boycotts have been targeting companies that have been accused of collaborating with the regime, including telecommunications companies and banks.\n\n## Media Western coverage\n\nThe protests in Iran have received widespread coverage in the Western media, with many outlets reporting on the bravery and determination of the protesters. However, some critics have accused the Western media of being biased in their coverage, with some outlets focusing too much on the protests and not enough on the government's response.\n\n# Casualties, government response\n\n## Casualties\n\nAccording to human rights groups, over 200 protesters have been killed in the crackdown, with many more injured. The government has also been accused of using excessive force, including tear gas, batons, and live ammunition.\n\n### Government casualties\n\nThe government has reported that several security forces have been killed in the clashes, with some reports suggesting that as many as 20 police officers have been killed.\n\n## Arrests and death sentences\n\nOver 10,000 protesters have been arrested in the crackdown, with many facing charges of rioting, vandalism, and other crimes. Some protesters have also been sentenced to death, with several reports suggesting that the government is planning to execute dozens of protesters in the coming weeks.\n\n### Executions\n\nIn December 2022, the Iranian government executed two protesters, Mohammad Mehdi Karami and Seyyed Mohammad Hosseini, who had been convicted of killing a security force member during the protests. The executions were widely condemned by human rights groups and Western governments.\n\n## Suspected food poisoning\n\nIn recent weeks, there have been reports of suspected food poisoning among university students and schoolgirls in Iran. The incidents have sparked widespread concern, with many fearing that the government is using poison to target protesters.\n\n### University students\n\nSeveral university students have reported falling ill after eating food in their dormitories, with some reports suggesting that the food was poisoned.\n\n### Schoolgirls\n\nThere have also been reports of schoolgirls falling ill after eating food in their schools, with some reports suggesting that the food was poisoned.\n\n## Statements by officials\n\nGovernment officials have been making statements in recent weeks, with some calling for greater calm and others warning protesters of the consequences of their actions.\n\n## Government strategy and tactics\n\nThe government has been using a range of strategies and tactics to suppress the protests, including the use of force, arrests, and propaganda. The government has also been trying to discredit the protesters, accusing them of being agents of foreign powers.\n\n## Communications blackouts\n\nThe government has been imposing communications blackouts in areas where the protests are taking place, making it difficult for protesters to communicate with each other.\n\n## Response by regime supporters\n\nRegime supporters have been responding to the protests, with some calling for greater action against the protesters. There have also been reports of regime supporters attacking protesters, with some incidents resulting in serious injuries.\n\n## Government campaign for public opinion\n\nThe government has been launching a campaign to win public opinion, with some officials making statements calling for greater calm and others warning protesters of the consequences of their actions.\n\n# Aftermath\n\n## Lack of head covering\n\nIn the aftermath of the protests, many Iranian women have been refusing to wear the hijab, or headscarf, in public. The move has been seen as a symbol of resistance against the government's strict dress code laws.\n\n### Crackdown\n\nThe government has been cracking down on women who refuse to wear the hijab, with some reports suggesting that women are being arrested and fined for not wearing the headscarf.\n\n### Surveillance of protesters and dissidents\n\nThe government has been increasing surveillance of protesters and dissidents, with some reports suggesting that the government is using social media to monitor the activities of activists.\n\n# Analysis\n\nThe protests in Iran have been seen as a significant challenge to the government's authority, with many analysts suggesting that the regime is facing a major crisis. The protests have also been seen as a symbol of the ongoing struggle for human rights and democracy in Iran.\n\n# International reactions\n\n## International organizations\n\nInternational organizations, including the United Nations and the European Union, have been condemning the government's response to the protests, with some calling for greater restraint and others calling for sanctions.\n\n## Diplomatic ties\n\nThe protests have also been affecting diplomatic ties between Iran and other countries, with some countries recalling their ambassadors and others imposing sanctions.\n\n## Human rights advocates\n\nHuman rights advocates have been calling for greater action to support the protesters, with some calling for sanctions and others calling for diplomatic pressure.\n\n## Sanctions\n\nThe United States and other countries have been imposing sanctions on Iran in response to the government's human rights record, with some reports suggesting that the sanctions are having a significant impact on the country's economy.\n\n# In popular culture\n\n## Music\n\nThe protests have been inspiring artists and musicians, with some releasing songs and music videos in support of the protesters.\n\n## Sports\n\nThe protests have also been affecting sports, with some Iranian athletes refusing to compete in international competitions in solidarity with the protesters.\n\n### 2022 FIFA World Cup\n\nThe protests have also been affecting the 2022 FIFA World Cup, with some Iranian players refusing to sing the national anthem in solidarity with the protesters.\n\n### Commercialism\n\nThe protests have also been affecting commercialism, with some companies pulling their advertisements from Iranian media outlets in response to the government's human rights record.\n\n# See also\n\n* 2009 Iranian presidential election protests\n* 2017 Iranian protests\n* 2019 Iranian protests\n* Iranian Revolution\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a neutral, encyclopedic summary of the Mahsa Amini protests.

Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) was a commercial bank that catered primarily to the tech industry, providing financial services to startups, venture capital firms, and other technology companies. The bank's collapse sent shockwaves through the financial system, raising concerns about the stability of the banking sector and the potential impact on the broader economy.\n\n#Background\n\nSilicon Valley Bank was founded in 1983 and was headquartered in Santa Clara, California. The bank grew rapidly over the years, becoming one of the largest banks in the United States, with over $200 billion in assets. SVB was known for its expertise in serving the tech industry, providing a range of financial services, including lending, deposit accounts, and investment banking. The bank's customer base included many prominent tech companies, such as Apple, Google, and Facebook, as well as numerous startups and venture capital firms.\n\nIn the years leading up to its collapse, SVB had experienced rapid growth, fueled by the expansion of the tech industry. However, this growth also led to increased competition and pressure to maintain profitability. SVB had invested heavily in long-term bonds, which had declined in value due to rising interest rates. Additionally, the bank had a high concentration of deposits from tech companies, which were subject to withdrawal at short notice.\n\n#Collapse\n\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank occurred on March 10, 2023, when the bank's parent company, SVB Financial Group, announced that it was seeking to raise additional capital to shore up its finances. However, the bank's efforts to raise capital were unsuccessful, and on March 10, the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) took possession of SVB, placing it into receivership.\n\n##Losses\n\nThe collapse of SVB resulted in significant losses for the bank's customers and shareholders. Many tech companies had deposited large sums of money with SVB, which were now at risk of being lost. Additionally, the bank's shareholders saw the value of their investments plummet, with the bank's stock price falling by over 80% in the days leading up to its collapse.\n\n##Instability\n\nThe collapse of SVB also raised concerns about the stability of the financial system. The bank's failure was the largest since the 2008 financial crisis, and it raised fears about the potential for a broader banking crisis. Many experts warned that the collapse of SVB could have a ripple effect, leading to a loss of confidence in the banking system and potentially triggering a wider financial crisis.\n\n##Receivership\n\nFollowing the collapse of SVB, the FDIC was appointed as the receiver to manage the bank's assets and liabilities. The FDIC's primary goal was to minimize disruption to the bank's customers and to maximize the recovery of assets. The FDIC worked to sell off the bank's assets, including its loan portfolio and securities holdings, to other banks and investors.\n\n##Acquisition\n\nOn March 26, 2023, the FDIC announced that it had sold SVB's assets to First Citizens Bank, a North Carolina-based bank. The sale included SVB's loan portfolio, securities holdings, and deposits. The acquisition was seen as a positive development, as it would help to stabilize the financial system and provide continuity for SVB's customers.\n\n#Effects\n\nThe collapse of SVB had significant effects on the bank's customers, shareholders, and the broader financial system.\n\n##Customers\n\nMany of SVB's customers were tech companies, which were heavily reliant on the bank for their financial needs. The collapse of SVB left these companies facing significant uncertainty, as they struggled to access their funds and conduct their day-to-day business. However, the sale of SVB's assets to First Citizens Bank helped to alleviate some of these concerns, as it provided continuity for the bank's customers.\n\n##Shareholders\n\nThe collapse of SVB resulted in significant losses for the bank's shareholders. The bank's stock price plummeted in the days leading up to its collapse, wiping out billions of dollars in shareholder value. Many shareholders were left facing significant financial losses, as they struggled to come to terms with the bank's failure.\n\n##Financial system\n\nThe collapse of SVB raised concerns about the stability of the financial system. The bank's failure was the largest since the 2008 financial crisis, and it raised fears about the potential for a broader banking crisis. However, the sale of SVB's assets to First Citizens Bank helped to alleviate some of these concerns, as it provided continuity for the bank's customers and helped to stabilize the financial system.\n\n##Legal actions\n\nIn the aftermath of the collapse, several lawsuits were filed against SVB and its executives, alleging that they had engaged in reckless and negligent behavior. The lawsuits claimed that the bank's executives had failed to properly manage the bank's risk and had misled investors about the bank's financial condition.\n\n#Reactions\n\nThe collapse of SVB sparked a range of reactions, from official responses to debates about government intervention and the causes of the bank's failure.\n\n##Official responses\n\nThe collapse of SVB prompted a swift response from regulators and government officials. The FDIC was appointed as the receiver to manage the bank's assets and liabilities, and the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve issued statements reassuring the public about the stability of the financial system.\n\n##Debate over government intervention\n\nThe collapse of SVB also sparked a debate about the role of government intervention in the banking system. Some argued that the government should have done more to prevent the bank's failure, while others argued that the government's actions had contributed to the bank's collapse.\n\n##Debate about causes\n\nThe collapse of SVB also sparked a debate about the causes of the bank's failure. Some argued that the bank's collapse was the result of poor management and excessive risk-taking, while others argued that the bank's failure was the result of broader economic and regulatory factors.\n\n#See also\n\n* Silicon Valley Bank\n* Bank failure\n* Financial crisis\n* Too big to fail\n* Systemic risk", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Collapse_of_Silicon_Valley_Bank\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Collapse\n##Losses\n##Instability\n##Receivership\n##Acquisition\n#Effects\n##Customers\n##Shareholders\n##Financial system\n##Legal actions\n#Reactions\n##Official responses\n##Debate over government intervention\n##Debate about causes\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

L. Zissu\n\nA. L. Zissu was a prominent Hasidic scholar, journalist, and leader of the Jewish community in Romania during the mid-20th century. Born into a family of Hasidic rabbis, Zissu's life was marked by a deep commitment to his faith and a strong desire to preserve the traditions of his community. Despite facing numerous challenges, including Nazi persecution, communist repression, and personal struggles, Zissu remained a steadfast advocate for Jewish rights and a vocal critic of authoritarian regimes.\n\n# Biography\n\n## Hasidic scholar and journalistic debut\n\nA. L. Zissu was born in 1888 in the town of Ștefănești, Romania, to a family of Hasidic rabbis. From a young age, Zissu demonstrated a keen interest in Jewish studies and was educated in the traditional manner of Hasidic scholars. He went on to become a respected Talmudic scholar and was ordained as a rabbi.\n\nIn addition to his religious pursuits, Zissu developed a passion for journalism and writing. He began his career as a journalist in the early 1900s, contributing to various Jewish publications in Romania. Zissu's writing often focused on issues related to Jewish life, culture, and politics, and he quickly established himself as a prominent voice in the Jewish community.\n\n## Religious Zionism\n\nZissu was deeply influenced by the ideology of Religious Zionism, which emphasized the importance of Jewish national identity and the need for a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He became an ardent supporter of the Zionist movement and worked tirelessly to promote its ideals within the Jewish community in Romania.\n\nThrough his writing and public speaking, Zissu advocated for the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine and encouraged Jewish immigration to the region. He also played a key role in organizing Zionist conferences and events in Romania, which helped to galvanize support for the movement.\n\n## Nazi persecution\n\nThe rise of Nazi Germany in the 1930s posed a significant threat to Jewish communities across Europe, including in Romania. Zissu, as a prominent Jewish leader and Zionist, was particularly vulnerable to persecution.\n\nIn 1940, Romania allied itself with Nazi Germany, and the country's Jewish population was subjected to increasingly harsh anti-Semitic laws and regulations. Zissu, along with many other Jewish leaders, was arrested and imprisoned on several occasions.\n\nDespite the dangers, Zissu continued to advocate for Jewish rights and to resist Nazi persecution. He worked closely with other Jewish leaders to provide aid and support to those affected by the Nazi regime and to promote Jewish unity in the face of adversity.\n\n## Resistance movement\n\nDuring World War II, Zissu became involved in the Jewish resistance movement in Romania. He worked closely with other Jewish leaders to organize underground activities, including the smuggling of Jewish refugees out of the country and the provision of aid to those in hiding.\n\nZissu also played a key role in documenting the atrocities committed against Jews during the war. He worked with other Jewish leaders to collect testimonies and evidence of Nazi crimes, which were later used in war crimes trials.\n\n## Jewish leadership\n\nAfter the war, Zissu emerged as a prominent leader of the Jewish community in Romania. He played a key role in rebuilding Jewish institutions and promoting Jewish culture in the country.\n\nZissu also worked closely with the Israeli government to promote Jewish immigration to Israel. He was a strong advocate for the rights of Jewish refugees and worked tirelessly to facilitate their resettlement in Israel.\n\n## Against communism\n\nThe rise of communism in Eastern Europe posed a new threat to Jewish communities, including in Romania. Zissu, as a vocal critic of authoritarian regimes, was particularly opposed to communism.\n\nHe spoke out against the communist regime in Romania, criticizing its human rights record and its treatment of Jewish citizens. Zissu also worked closely with other anti-communist activists to promote democracy and human rights in the country.\n\n## Securitate set-up and imprisonment\n\nIn 1954, Zissu was set up by the Securitate, Romania's secret police, on charges of espionage and subversion. He was arrested and imprisoned, and his health began to deteriorate.\n\nDespite his imprisonment, Zissu continued to advocate for Jewish rights and to resist communist persecution. He was a source of inspiration to other Jewish prisoners and played a key role in maintaining Jewish morale in the face of adversity.\n\n## Trial, reprieve, and death\n\nZissu's trial was a show trial, designed to demonstrate the communist regime's power and control. He was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\nHowever, due to international pressure and the efforts of Jewish organizations, Zissu's sentence was commuted, and he was released from prison in 1956. His health had deteriorated significantly, and he died in 1958 at the age of 70.\n\n# Legacy\n\nA. L. Zissu's legacy is complex and multifaceted. He was a prominent Hasidic scholar, a vocal critic of authoritarian regimes, and a steadfast advocate for Jewish rights.\n\nThrough his writing and public speaking, Zissu played a key role in promoting Jewish culture and identity in Romania. He was a prominent leader of the Jewish community and worked tirelessly to promote Jewish unity and solidarity.\n\nZissu's resistance to Nazi persecution and communist repression is a testament to his courage and conviction. He was a source of inspiration to many and continues to be remembered as a hero of the Jewish community.\n\nDespite the challenges he faced, Zissu remained committed to his faith and his community. He was a shining example of Jewish resilience and determination, and his legacy continues to inspire Jewish communities around the world.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"A._L._Zissu\" following this outline:\n\n#Biography\n##Hasidic scholar and journalistic debut\n##Religious Zionism\n##Nazi persecution\n##Resistance movement\n##Jewish leadership\n##Against communism\n##Securitate set-up and imprisonment\n##Trial, reprieve, and death\n#Legacy\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He is best known for his record-breaking expeditions to the deepest parts of the ocean and his journey to space on the Blue Origin New Shepard spacecraft.\n\n#Early life and education\n\nHamish Harding was born on June 25, 1964, in London, England. He grew up in a family of modest means and developed a passion for adventure and exploration from an early age. Harding's parents encouraged his curiosity and supported his interests in science and technology.\n\nHarding attended the University of London, where he studied physics and engineering. During his university years, he became fascinated with the concept of space exploration and the potential for humans to venture beyond Earth's atmosphere. After completing his undergraduate degree, Harding went on to earn a master's degree in business administration from the London Business School.\n\n#Career and adventures\n\nAfter completing his education, Harding began his career in the financial sector, working for several prominent investment banks in London. However, he soon became restless and decided to pursue his true passion for adventure and exploration.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Harding embarked on a series of record-breaking expeditions to the North and South Poles. He became one of the first people to reach the North Pole solo and unsupported, and he also completed a 60-day trek to the South Pole.\n\nHarding's polar expeditions caught the attention of the media, and he began to attract sponsors and supporters for his adventures. He went on to lead several high-profile expeditions, including a successful ascent of Mount Everest and a journey to the summit of K2.\n\n##Titan expedition\n\nIn 2019, Harding announced plans for his most ambitious expedition to date: a journey to the deepest part of the ocean, the Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench. Harding would be joining a team of scientists and explorers on the Five Deeps Expedition, led by Victor Vescovo.\n\nThe expedition aimed to explore the deepest points in each of the world's five oceans and to conduct scientific research on the unique ecosystems found in these environments. Harding would be participating in the expedition as a submersible pilot and would be responsible for collecting samples and data from the ocean floor.\n\n#Titan expedition and death\n\nOn March 26, 2021, Harding and his colleague, Paul-Henri Nargeolet, embarked on a dive to the Challenger Deep in the submersible vessel, Titan. The dive was intended to be a historic moment, marking the first time a commercial submersible had reached the bottom of the trench.\n\nHowever, tragedy struck when the Titan submersible lost contact with the surface support team. A search and rescue operation was launched, but it was too late. Harding and Nargeolet were pronounced dead, and their bodies were recovered from the ocean floor.\n\nThe incident was met with shock and sadness from the scientific and exploration communities. Harding's death was seen as a tragic loss, and he was remembered for his bravery, his passion for adventure, and his contributions to our understanding of the world's oceans.\n\n#Personal life\n\nHamish Harding was married to his wife, Lisa, and had two children. He was known to be a devoted family man and enjoyed spending time with his loved ones. Harding was also an avid pilot and enjoyed flying in his spare time.\n\nHarding was also a passionate advocate for ocean conservation and was involved in several charitable organizations dedicated to protecting the world's oceans. He believed in the importance of preserving these ecosystems for future generations and worked tirelessly to raise awareness about the impact of human activity on the ocean environment.\n\n#Awards and recognition\n\nThroughout his career, Harding received numerous awards and accolades for his achievements in exploration and adventure. He was awarded the Guinness World Record for the fastest journey to the North Pole solo and unsupported, and he also received the Royal Geographical Society's prestigious Shackleton Medal for his contributions to exploration and scientific research.\n\nHarding was also a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and a member of the Explorers Club. He was recognized for his bravery and his commitment to exploration, and he will be remembered as one of the greatest adventurers of his generation.\n\n#See also\n\n* Five Deeps Expedition\n* Victor Vescovo\n* Challenger Deep\n* Mariana Trench\n* Ocean conservation\n* Exploration\n* Adventure\n\n#References\n\n*Note: This article does not include any references or citations.\n\n#External links\n\n*Note: This article does not include any external links.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Hamish_Harding\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and education\n#Career and adventures\n#Titan expedition and death\n#Personal life\n#Awards and recognition\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The team's colours are blue, white, and red, and the tricolores are one of the most successful national teams in the world, with two FIFA World Cup titles, two UEFA European Championships, and numerous other honours.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\n### Early years (1900–1930s)\n\nThe France national team was formed in 1900, and their first official match was against Belgium on May 1, 1904. The team's early years were marked by inconsistent performances, but they did manage to win the 1904 Summer Olympics football tournament. France's first World Cup appearance was in 1930, where they were eliminated in the group stage, losing to Chile and Argentina.\n\n### 1950s–1980s\n\nThe 1950s saw a resurgence in French football, with the emergence of legendary players like Raymond Kopa, Just Fontaine, and Michel Platini. The team's first major tournament success came in 1958, when they finished third at the FIFA World Cup in Sweden, where they were defeated by Brazil in the semifinals. France's next major success came in 1984, when they won the UEFA European Championship, hosted in France, defeating Spain 2-0 in the final.\n\n### Zidane era and World Champions (1996–2006)\n\nThe mid-1990s saw the emergence of a new generation of French players, led by Zinedine Zidane, Thierry Henry, and Patrick Vieira. This team, known as the \"Golden Generation,\" won the 1998 FIFA World Cup, hosted in France, defeating Brazil 3-0 in the final. They also won the 2000 UEFA European Championship, where they defeated Italy 2-1 in the final. France's success continued in the early 2000s, with a 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup title and a runners-up finish at the 2006 FIFA World Cup, where they lost to Italy in the final.\n\n### Decline and rebuild (2007–2015)\n\nFrance's success was followed by a decline in the late 2000s, with a disappointing 2010 FIFA World Cup campaign, where they were eliminated in the group stage, and a 2012 UEFA European Championship semifinal defeat to Spain. The team underwent a rebuilding process, with the introduction of new players like Paul Pogba, Raphaël Varane, and Antoine Griezmann. France's fortunes began to improve in the mid-2010s, with a 2014 FIFA World Cup quarterfinal appearance, where they lost to Germany, and a 2016 UEFA European Championship runners-up finish, where they lost to Portugal in the final.\n\n### Renewed success (2016–present)\n\nFrance's resurgence continued in the late 2010s, with a 2018 FIFA World Cup title, where they defeated Croatia 4-2 in the final. They also won the 2020 UEFA Nations League title, where they defeated Spain 2-1 in the final. France's success has been built on a talented young team, with players like Kylian Mbappé, N'Golo Kanté, and Benjamin Pavard.\n\nHome stadium\n------------\n\nThe France national team plays its home matches at the Stade de France, located in Saint-Denis, a suburb of Paris. The stadium, which was built for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, has a seating capacity of over 81,000 spectators. The Stade de France is also used for other sports events and concerts.\n\nTeam image\n----------\n\n### Media coverage\n\nThe France national team's matches are broadcast on TF1, a French television channel, and beIN Sports, a French sports network. The team's matches are also broadcast on radio stations like France Inter and Europe 1.\n\n### Kits and crest\n\nThe France national team's kits are designed by Nike, an American sports equipment company.

The storm brought heavy snowfall, high winds, and low visibility, causing widespread damage and disruption to transportation, communication, and daily life. The storm's impact was felt across several states and provinces, with the hardest-hit areas including Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, New York, Ontario, and Quebec.\n\n# Meteorological history\n\nThe Great Snowstorm of 1944 was a classic nor'easter, forming off the coast of North Carolina on December 22, 1944. The storm system moved rapidly northward, intensifying as it interacted with a cold front from Canada. By December 24, the storm had reached the northeastern United States, bringing heavy snowfall and high winds to the region. The storm's center passed over the Appalachian Mountains, causing the snowfall to intensify and become more widespread.\n\nThe storm's meteorological characteristics were typical of a nor'easter, with sustained winds of up to 60 mph (97 km/h) and snowfall rates of up to 2 inches (5 cm) per hour. The storm's low-pressure center was particularly intense, with a central pressure of 960 mbar (28.35 inHg) at its peak. The storm's strong winds and low visibility made travel extremely hazardous, with drifts reaching as high as 20 feet (6 meters) in some areas.\n\n# Overall impact\n\nThe Great Snowstorm of 1944 had a significant impact on the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. The storm caused widespread power outages, with over 1 million households affected. The storm also disrupted communication networks, with phone and telegraph lines severed in many areas.

The storm also had a major impact on daily life, with many residents forced to stay indoors for extended periods. The storm's aftermath saw a significant increase in emergency services, with many residents requiring assistance with food, shelter, and medical care.\n\n# Fatalities and injuries\n\nThe Great Snowstorm of 1944 was responsible for 77 reported fatalities, with many more injured. The majority of fatalities were due to hypothermia, with many residents succumbing to the extreme cold. Others died from accidents related to the storm, including traffic accidents and falls.\n\nThe storm's impact on emergency services was significant, with many hospitals and medical facilities overwhelmed with patients. The storm's aftermath saw a significant increase in emergency responders, with many workers risking their lives to assist those in need.\n\n# Impacts on most affected areas\n\n## Ohio\n\nOhio was one of the states most affected by the Great Snowstorm of 1944.

The blockade has been in place since 1989, with varying degrees of intensity, and has had a significant impact on the daily lives of the people living in the region.\n\n# Background\n\n## First blockade (1989–2023) and isolation from Armenia (1989–1992)\n\nThe first blockade of Nagorno-Karabakh was imposed in 1989, as the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast declared its independence from Azerbaijan and sought to join Armenia. The blockade was enforced by Azerbaijan, which sought to prevent the movement of people, goods, and services between Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia. The blockade had a devastating impact on the economy of Nagorno-Karabakh, leading to widespread poverty, unemployment, and shortages of essential goods.\n\nIn 1992, the Armenian government, led by President Levon Ter-Petrosyan, signed a ceasefire agreement with Azerbaijan, which led to the establishment of a fragile peace in the region. However, the blockade remained in place, and Nagorno-Karabakh continued to be isolated from Armenia.\n\n## Threats to public utility infrastructure and entry\n\nIn the years following the ceasefire, there were repeated threats to the public utility infrastructure and entry points into Nagorno-Karabakh. In 2005, Azerbaijan threatened to cut off the gas supply to Nagorno-Karabakh, which would have had a devastating impact on the region's economy. Similarly, in 2014, Azerbaijan threatened to close the Lachin Corridor, which is the main entry point into Nagorno-Karabakh.\n\n## Prelude\n\nIn the months leading up to the blockade, there were repeated warnings from Azerbaijan that it would take action to protect its interests in Nagorno-Karabakh. In July 2022, the Azerbaijani government announced that it would be taking steps to protect its environment and natural resources in the region. At the same time, there were reports of Azerbaijani activists and environmentalists protesting in the region, calling for greater protection of the environment.\n\n# Blockade timeline\n\n## 2022 events\n\nOn December 12, 2022, a group of Azerbaijani activists and environmentalists blocked the Lachin Corridor, which is the main entry point into Nagorno-Karabakh. The blockade was enforced by Azerbaijani police and military personnel, who prevented the movement of people, goods, and services into and out of the region.\n\n## 2023 events\n\nIn January 2023, the blockade was tightened, with Azerbaijani authorities preventing the entry of essential goods, including food, medicine, and fuel, into Nagorno-Karabakh. The blockade has had a devastating impact on the region's economy, leading to widespread shortages and price increases.\n\n# Humanitarian crisis\n\n## Lack of access to supplies and medical care\n\nThe blockade has led to a humanitarian crisis in Nagorno-Karabakh, with the region's population facing severe shortages of essential goods, including food, medicine, and fuel. The lack of access to medical care has had a devastating impact on the region's healthcare system, with hospitals and clinics facing severe shortages of medical supplies and equipment.\n\n### Limited supplies transported by the Red Cross and the Russian peacekeepers\n\nDespite the blockade, limited supplies have been transported into Nagorno-Karabakh by the Red Cross and Russian peacekeepers. However, these supplies have been insufficient to meet the needs of the region's population, and the blockade has had a devastating impact on the region's economy.\n\n## Damage to infrastructure\n\nThe blockade has also led to significant damage to the region's infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and public buildings. The lack of access to essential goods and services has had a devastating impact on the region's economy, leading to widespread poverty and unemployment.\n\n# Genocide risk factors\n\nThe blockade has raised concerns about the risk of genocide in Nagorno-Karabakh. The region's population has faced repeated threats and violence from Azerbaijan, and the blockade has had a devastating impact on the region's economy and healthcare system.\n\n# Inaction of the Russian peacekeepers\n\nThe Russian peacekeepers, who have been stationed in Nagorno-Karabakh since 1992, have been criticized for their inaction in the face of the blockade. Despite their mandate to protect the region's population, the Russian peacekeepers have failed to take effective action to lift the blockade and ensure the safe passage of people, goods, and services.\n\n# Proposed solutions\n\nThere have been several proposed solutions to the blockade, including the establishment of a humanitarian corridor to allow the safe passage of essential goods and services into Nagorno-Karabakh. However, these proposals have been rejected by Azerbaijan, which has insisted that the blockade will remain in place until its demands are met.\n\n# Authenticity of the environmental activism claims\n\n## Involvement of the Azerbaijani government\n\nThere have been concerns about the authenticity of the environmental activism claims that have been used to justify the blockade. The Azerbaijani government has been accused of orchestrating the protests and using environmental concerns as a pretext to justify its actions.\n\n## Involvement of state employees and civil servants\n\nThere have been reports that state employees and civil servants have been involved in the protests, which has raised concerns about the authenticity of the environmental activism claims.\n\n## Inaccessibility of Nagorno-Karabakh to the public and independent journalists\n\nThe region of Nagorno-Karabakh has been inaccessible to the public and independent journalists, which has made it difficult to verify the claims of environmental activism.\n\n## Scrutiny of the \"protesters\" and their alleged environmental concerns\n\nThe \"protesters\" and their alleged environmental concerns have been subject to scrutiny, with many accusing them of being fake and orchestrated by the Azerbaijani government.\n\n# Lawsuits\n\n## International Court of Justice\n\nThere have been calls for the International Court of Justice to take action to lift the blockade and ensure the safe passage of people, goods, and services into Nagorno-Karabakh.\n\n## European Court of Human Rights\n\nThe European Court of Human Rights has been petitioned to take action to protect the human rights of the people living in Nagorno-Karabakh, who have been affected by the blockade.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## Involved parties\n\nThe involved parties, including Armenia and Azerbaijan, have reacted to the blockade with concern and condemnation. The Armenian government has accused Azerbaijan of using the blockade as a pretext to justify its actions, while the Azerbaijani government has insisted that the blockade will remain in place until its demands are met.\n\n## International\n\nThe international community has reacted to the blockade with concern and condemnation. The United Nations has called for the lifting of the blockade and the safe passage of people, goods, and services into Nagorno-Karabakh.\n\n## Supranational\n\nThe supranational organizations, including the European Union and the Council of Europe, have reacted to the blockade with concern and condemnation. The European Union has called for the lifting of the blockade and the safe passage of people, goods, and services into Nagorno-Karabakh.\n\n## Non-governmental organizations\n\nThe non-governmental organizations, including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, have reacted to the blockade with concern and condemnation. They have called for the lifting of the blockade and the safe passage of people, goods, and services into Nagorno-Karabakh.\n\n# See also\n\n* Nagorno-Karabakh conflict\n* Armenia-Azerbaijan relations\n* Blockade\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a factual account of the blockade of Nagorno-Karabakh.

It is the largest land carnivore on Earth, with adult males weighing up to 800 kg (1,764 lb). The polar bear is well adapted to its harsh, icy environment, with a thick layer of fat and a white coat that helps it to blend in with its snowy surroundings. Despite its fearsome reputation, the polar bear is an important and iconic species that plays a vital role in maintaining the balance of the Arctic ecosystem.\n\n# Naming\n\nThe name \"polar bear\" is a translation of the Norwegian word \"isbjørn,\" which means \"ice bear.\" The scientific name \"Ursus maritimus\" is derived from the Latin words \"ursus,\" meaning \"bear,\" and \"maritimus,\" meaning \"of the sea.\" This refers to the polar bear's marine habitat and its ability to swim long distances.\n\n# Taxonomy\n\n## Evolution\n\nThe polar bear is a member of the Ursidae family, which includes all bears. Its closest relatives are the brown bear (Ursus arctos) and the black bear (Ursus americanus). The exact timing and location of the polar bear's evolutionary origins are still a matter of debate among scientists. However, it is thought that the polar bear diverged from the brown bear around 200,000 years ago, during the Pleistocene era. This was likely in response to changes in the climate and the availability of food, which led to the development of distinct adaptations to the Arctic environment.\n\n# Characteristics\n\nThe polar bear is a large animal, with adult males reaching lengths of up to 3 m (10 ft) and weighing up to 800 kg (1,764 lb). Females are smaller, reaching lengths of up to 2.5 m (8 ft) and weighing up to 400 kg (882 lb). The polar bear's fur is white, with two layers: a thick undercoat and a longer, guard hair layer. This helps to keep the bear warm in cold temperatures and also provides camouflage in the snow. The polar bear's skin is black, which helps to absorb heat from the sun. Its eyes, nose, and lips are also black, which helps to reduce glare on the snow.\n\nThe polar bear's body is well adapted to its marine environment. Its fur is water-repellent, and its skin is thick and fatty, which helps to keep it warm in cold water. Its front paws are large and flat, which helps to propel it through the water. Its hind paws are smaller and more rounded, which helps to steer. The polar bear's claws are long and sharp, which helps to grip the ice and to catch prey.\n\n# Distribution and habitat\n\nThe polar bear is found in the Arctic region, including Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Norway, and Russia. It inhabits areas with sea ice, which provides a platform for hunting and breeding. The polar bear's range extends from the northern coast of Alaska to the northern coast of Norway, and from the eastern coast of Greenland to the western coast of Russia.\n\nThe polar bear's habitat is characterized by cold temperatures, sea ice, and a limited availability of food. The Arctic region is home to a variety of species, including seals, walruses, and belugas, which provide a source of food for the polar bear. The polar bear's habitat is also characterized by a limited availability of shelter, which makes it vulnerable to changes in the climate.\n\n# Behaviour and ecology\n\n## Social life\n\nThe polar bear is a solitary animal, with adults typically only coming together to mate. Female polar bears will often stay with their cubs for several years, teaching them essential skills such as hunting and swimming. Male polar bears will often wander on their own, covering large distances in search of food and potential mates.\n\n## Diet and hunting\n\nThe polar bear is a carnivorous animal, with a diet that consists mainly of seals and other marine mammals. It is a skilled hunter, using its sense of smell to locate prey and its speed and agility to catch it. The polar bear's main source of food is the ringed seal (Pusa hispida), which provides a rich source of fat and protein.\n\nThe polar bear's hunting behavior is adapted to its Arctic environment. It will often wait at the edge of a breathing hole, waiting for a seal to emerge, or it will stalk its prey across the ice. The polar bear's sense of smell is highly developed, which allows it to detect the presence of seals and other prey.\n\n## Reproduction and development\n\nFemale polar bears will typically give birth to two cubs per year, which are born blind and helpless. The cubs will stay with their mother for several years, relying on her for food and protection. The mother will teach the cubs essential skills such as hunting and swimming, which are critical for their survival.\n\nThe polar bear's reproductive cycle is adapted to its Arctic environment. Female polar bears will typically mate in the spring, and the cubs will be born in the winter. This allows the mother to nurse the cubs during the winter months, when food is scarce.\n\n## Mortality\n\nThe polar bear's mortality rate is influenced by a variety of factors, including climate change, human-polar bear conflicts, and disease. Climate change is having a significant impact on the polar bear's habitat, with the loss of sea ice reducing the availability of food and shelter.\n\nHuman-polar bear conflicts are also a major concern, with polar bears coming into contact with humans more frequently as their habitat is reduced. This can lead to conflicts, particularly when polar bears are attracted to human food sources.\n\n# Conservation status\n\nThe polar bear is listed as \"vulnerable\" on the IUCN Red List, with its population declining due to climate change and other human activities. The main threat to the polar bear's survival is the loss of sea ice, which reduces the availability of food and shelter.\n\n# Relationship with humans\n\n## Exploitation\n\nThe polar bear has been exploited by humans for centuries, with its fur and body parts being used for a variety of purposes. The polar bear's fur is highly valued, and it has been used to make clothing and other products.\n\n## Conflicts\n\nHuman-polar bear conflicts are a major concern, particularly in areas where polar bears are coming into contact with humans more frequently. This can lead to conflicts, particularly when polar bears are attracted to human food sources.\n\n## Captivity\n\nPolar bears are often kept in captivity, particularly in zoos and wildlife parks. This can provide an opportunity for education and research, but it also raises concerns about the welfare of the bears.\n\n## Cultural significance\n\nThe polar bear has significant cultural and symbolic meaning, particularly in Arctic communities. It is often seen as a symbol of strength and resilience, and it plays an important role in the mythology and folklore of many Arctic cultures.\n\n# See also\n\n* Arctic ecosystem\n* Climate change\n* Ursidae family\n* Marine mammals\n\n# Notes\n\n* The polar bear's scientific name \"Ursus maritimus\" is derived from the Latin words \"ursus,\" meaning \"bear,\" and \"maritimus,\" meaning \"of the sea.\"\n* The polar bear's fur is white, with two layers: a thick undercoat and a longer, guard hair layer.\n* The polar bear's skin is black, which helps to absorb heat from the sun.\n* The polar bear's body is well adapted to its marine environment, with a thick layer of fat and a water-repellent coat.\n\n# References\n\n* This article does not include any citations or references.\n\n# Bibliography\n\n* This article does not include any bibliography.\n\n# External links\n\n* IUCN Red List: Ursus maritimus\n* National Geographic: Polar bear\n* WWF: Polar bear", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Polar_bear\" following this outline:\n\n#Naming\n#Taxonomy\n##Evolution\n#Characteristics\n#Distribution and habitat\n#Behaviour and ecology\n##Social life\n##Diet and hunting\n##Reproduction and development\n##Mortality\n#Conservation status\n#Relationship with humans\n##Exploitation\n##Conflicts\n##Captivity\n##Cultural significance\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He is best known for his philosophical works, particularly \"The Consolation of Philosophy,\" which has had a profound impact on Western philosophy and literature. This article will provide an overview of Boethius' life, works, and legacy, and explore his significance in the history of philosophy.\n\n#Early life\n\nBoethius was born in Rome around 480 AD to a noble family. His father, Manlius Boethius, was a consul and a prominent figure in Roman politics. After his father's death, Boethius was raised by Quintus Aurelius Memmius Symmachus, a distinguished statesman and scholar. Symmachus provided Boethius with a comprehensive education in Greek and Roman literature, philosophy, and rhetoric.\n\nBoethius' early life was marked by a strong interest in philosophy, particularly the works of Plato and Aristotle. He was also deeply influenced by the Christian faith, although the extent of his Christian commitment is a matter of debate among scholars. Boethius' intellectual curiosity and passion for learning earned him recognition and respect in Roman intellectual circles.\n\n#Rise to power\n\nBoethius' rise to power began in the early 6th century, when he became a senator and a prominent figure in Roman politics. He was appointed as the magister officiorum (master of offices) by King Theodoric the Great, the ruler of the Ostrogothic Kingdom, which had conquered Italy in the late 5th century. Boethius' position gave him significant influence over the king's policies and decisions.\n\nBoethius used his position to promote the interests of the Roman aristocracy and to protect the rights of the Catholic Church. He also worked to maintain good relations between the Ostrogothic Kingdom and the Eastern Roman Empire. Boethius' diplomatic skills and his ability to navigate the complex web of alliances and rivalries between the various barbarian kingdoms and the Roman Empire earned him a reputation as a skilled statesman.\n\n#Downfall and death\n\nBoethius' downfall began in 523 AD, when he was accused of treason against King Theodoric. The charges were likely fabricated, and Boethius was probably a victim of court politics and intrigue. Despite his protests of innocence, Boethius was imprisoned and eventually executed in 524 AD.\n\nDuring his imprisonment, Boethius wrote his most famous work, \"The Consolation of Philosophy.\" This philosophical treatise explores the nature of fortune, the role of Providence, and the human condition. Boethius' execution marked the end of an era of relative tolerance and cooperation between the Ostrogothic Kingdom and the Catholic Church.\n\n#Major works\n\nBoethius was a prolific writer, and his works cover a wide range of subjects, including philosophy, theology, mathematics, and music.\n\n##De consolatione philosophiae\n\n\"The Consolation of Philosophy\" is Boethius' most famous work, written during his imprisonment. The book is a philosophical treatise that explores the nature of fortune, the role of Providence, and the human condition. Boethius uses a dialogue between himself and the personification of Philosophy to explore these themes. The book is a masterpiece of philosophical literature and has had a profound impact on Western philosophy and literature.\n\n##De topicis differentiis\n\n\"On Topical Differentiations\" is a philosophical treatise that explores the nature of reality and the human condition. Boethius uses the concept of \"topics\" to explore the relationships between different concepts and ideas. The book is a significant contribution to the development of medieval philosophy and has influenced many later philosophers.\n\n##De arithmetica\n\n\"The Arithmetic\" is a mathematical treatise that explores the nature of numbers and their relationships. Boethius uses a combination of philosophical and mathematical arguments to explore the properties of numbers and their role in the universe. The book is a significant contribution to the development of medieval mathematics and has influenced many later mathematicians.\n\n##De institutione musica\n\n\"The Principles of Music\" is a musical treatise that explores the nature of music and its role in the universe. Boethius uses a combination of philosophical and musical arguments to explore the properties of music and its relationships to other art forms. The book is a significant contribution to the development of medieval music theory and has influenced many later musicians.\n\n##Opuscula sacra\n\n\"The Sacred Tracts\" is a collection of theological treatises that explore the nature of God, the universe, and the human condition. Boethius uses a combination of philosophical and theological arguments to explore the relationships between faith and reason. The book is a significant contribution to the development of medieval theology and has influenced many later theologians.\n\n#Dates of works\n\nThe exact dates of Boethius' works are not certain, but most scholars agree on the following chronology:\n\n* \"The Arithmetic\" and \"The Principles of Music\": early 6th century\n* \"On Topical Differentiations\" and \"The Sacred Tracts\": mid-6th century\n* \"The Consolation of Philosophy\": 523-524 AD\n\n#Legacy\n\nBoethius' legacy is profound and far-reaching. His philosophical works, particularly \"The Consolation of Philosophy,\" have had a significant impact on Western philosophy and literature. His influence can be seen in the works of many later philosophers, including Thomas Aquinas, Dante Alighieri, and Geoffrey Chaucer.\n\nBoethius' emphasis on the importance of reason and intellect has made him a hero to many scholars and philosophers. His commitment to the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom has inspired generations of scholars and philosophers.\n\n#Veneration\n\nBoethius is venerated as a saint by the Catholic Church, which celebrates his feast day on October 23. He is also recognized as a martyr and a confessor by the Eastern Orthodox Church.\n\n#In popular culture\n\nBoethius has appeared in many works of popular culture, including literature, music, and film. His influence can be seen in the works of many authors, including Dante Alighieri, Geoffrey Chaucer, and T.S. Eliot.\n\n#See also\n\n* Neoplatonism\n* Stoicism\n* Aristotelianism\n* Medieval philosophy\n* Scholasticism\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is based on the available sources and is intended to provide a general overview of Boethius' life and works.

The leaked material, which included sensitive information about national security and military operations, was widely reported on by the media and sparked a heated debate about the balance between freedom of information and national security.\n\n#Early life\n\nLittle is known about Jack Teixeira's early life, as he has maintained a relatively low public profile. It is reported that he grew up in the United States and enlisted in the Air National Guard at a young age. Teixeira's motivations for joining the military are unclear, but it is believed that he was drawn to the sense of service and camaraderie that comes with military life.\n\nAs a member of the Air National Guard, Teixeira underwent rigorous training and education, which included courses on information security and the handling of classified materials. It is unclear whether Teixeira had any prior experience with computers or cybersecurity before joining the military, but it is reported that he quickly developed a strong interest in these areas.\n\n#Career\n\nTeixeira's military career was marked by a series of promotions and specializations. He quickly rose through the ranks, becoming an airman first class and later a non-commissioned officer. Teixeira's specialties included intelligence analysis and cybersecurity, and he was reportedly well-respected by his peers for his expertise in these areas.\n\nIn addition to his military duties, Teixeira was also an avid online personality. He maintained a presence on various social media platforms and online forums, where he discussed topics ranging from national security to video games. Teixeira's online activities were largely innocuous, but they did raise some eyebrows among his superiors, who were concerned about the potential security risks posed by his online presence.\n\n#Alleged publication of leaked material\n\nIn 2022, Teixeira was accused of leaking classified documents on the internet. The leaked material, which included sensitive information about national security and military operations, was widely reported on by the media and sparked a heated debate about the balance between freedom of information and national security.\n\nThe leaked documents, which were reportedly obtained by Teixeira through his work as an intelligence analyst, included information about military operations in the Middle East and Africa. They also included sensitive information about national security, including details about the US government's surveillance programs and counterterrorism operations.\n\n##Arrest and prosecution\n\nTeixeira was arrested in 2022 and charged with the unauthorized disclosure of classified information. He was also charged with computer fraud and abuse, and with violating the Espionage Act.\n\nTeixeira's arrest and prosecution were widely reported on by the media, and sparked a heated debate about the balance between freedom of information and national security. Many of Teixeira's supporters argued that he was a whistleblower who had acted in the public interest, while others argued that he had recklessly endangered national security.\n\nTeixeira's trial is ongoing, and it is unclear what the outcome will be. However, it is clear that the case has raised important questions about the balance between freedom of information and national security, and about the role of the military and the intelligence community in protecting sensitive information.\n\n#See also\n\n* Chelsea Manning\n* Edward Snowden\n* Julian Assange\n* WikiLeaks\n\n#References\n\n*Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements*\n\n#External links\n\n*Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements*", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Jack_Teixeira\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n#Career\n#Alleged publication of leaked material\n##Arrest and prosecution\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The game retains the same combat system as its predecessor, with Kratos using his Leviathan Axe and the Blades of Chaos to take down enemies. The game also introduces new combat mechanics, such as the ability to use Kratos' shield to deflect projectiles and the return of the \"Runic Attacks\" system, which allows Kratos to unleash powerful magical attacks.\n\nThe game also features a new \"Realms\" system, which allows Kratos to explore the nine realms of Norse mythology. Each realm has its own unique environment and challenges, and players must use Kratos' abilities to overcome obstacles and defeat enemies. The game also features a variety of puzzles and platforming sections, which require players to use Kratos' abilities in creative ways.\n\n#Synopsis\n\n##Setting\n\nGod of War Ragnarök is set three years after the events of the previous game.

Kratos and Atreus must travel to the different realms of Norse mythology to stop Thor and prevent the end of the world.\n\n###Valhalla\n\nThe game's story is heavily focused on the concept of Valhalla, the afterlife of Norse mythology. Kratos and Atreus must travel to Valhalla to stop Thor and prevent the end of the world. However, their journey is complicated by the fact that Valhalla is a realm that is only accessible to those who have died in battle, and Kratos and Atreus must find a way to enter the realm without dying.\n\n#Development\n\nGod of War Ragnarök was developed by Santa Monica Studio, which is the same studio that developed the previous game.

Some fans were disappointed by the fact that the game's story would not be set in ancient Greece, and others were concerned about the introduction of new characters.\n\n##Soundtrack\n\nThe game's soundtrack was composed by Bear McCreary, who also composed the soundtrack for the previous game. The soundtrack features a mix of orchestral and choral pieces, and includes several songs that are inspired by Norse mythology.\n\n#Release\n\nGod of War Ragnarök was released on November 9, 2022, for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.

The game also won several other awards, including Best Narrative and Best Score.\n\n#Future\n\nGod of War Ragnarök is the final game in the Norse saga of the God of War series.
