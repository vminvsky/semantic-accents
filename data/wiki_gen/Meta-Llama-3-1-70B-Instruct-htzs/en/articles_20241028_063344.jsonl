The storm brought strong winds, heavy rainfall, and significant flooding to various regions, causing widespread disruption and damage.\n\n# Meteorological history\n\nHurricane Bonnie originated from a tropical wave that emerged from the western coast of Africa on June 25, 2022. The wave moved westward across the Atlantic, gradually developing a low-pressure system on June 30. Over the next few days, the system strengthened, becoming a tropical depression on July 1, and then a tropical storm on July 2, at which point it was given the name Bonnie.\n\nBonnie rapidly intensified as it moved west-northwestward across the Caribbean, becoming a hurricane on July 3. The storm continued to strengthen, reaching its peak intensity on July 5, with maximum sustained winds of 120 mph (195 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 970 mbar (28.64 inHg).\n\nAfter reaching its peak, Bonnie began to weaken, making landfall in Nicaragua on July 6 as a tropical storm. The storm then moved westward across Central America, emerging into the eastern Pacific on July 7. Bonnie re-strengthened over the Pacific, becoming a hurricane again on July 8, and maintaining hurricane strength until it dissipated on July 11.\n\n# Preparations and impacts\n\n## Trinidad and Tobago\n\nBonnie brought strong winds and heavy rainfall to Trinidad and Tobago, causing widespread power outages and damage to buildings. The storm made landfall on the island of Trinidad on July 3, with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph (130 km/h). The government declared a state of emergency, and schools and businesses were closed.\n\nThe Trinidad and Tobago Meteorological Service reported sustained winds of up to 70 mph (110 km/h) and gusts of up to 90 mph (145 km/h) in some areas. The storm caused significant flooding, particularly in the southern part of the island, with reports of waters rising to as high as 6 feet (1.8 meters) in some areas.\n\n## Mexico\n\nBonnie brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to Mexico, particularly in the states of Veracruz and Tabasco. The storm made landfall in Veracruz on July 6, with maximum sustained winds of 70 mph (110 km/h).\n\nThe Mexican government declared a state of emergency in both Veracruz and Tabasco, with reports of widespread flooding and power outages. The storm caused significant damage to buildings and infrastructure, particularly in the city of Veracruz, where reports indicated that up to 10,000 homes were affected.\n\n## Elsewhere\n\nBonnie also brought strong winds and heavy rainfall to other countries in the Caribbean and Central America, including Jamaica, Honduras, and Costa Rica. The storm caused widespread power outages and damage to buildings, particularly in rural areas.\n\nIn Jamaica, the storm made landfall on July 3, with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (95 km/h). The government declared a state of emergency, and schools and businesses were closed.\n\nIn Honduras, the storm caused significant flooding, particularly in the western part of the country. Reports indicated that up to 10,000 people were affected, with many forced to evacuate their homes.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of Category 3 Atlantic hurricanes\n* List of Pacific hurricanes\n* Hurricane season\n\n# References\n\n# External links\n\n* National Hurricane Center (NHC) - official website\n* National Weather Service (NWS) - official website\n* Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency (CDEMA) - official website", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Hurricane_Bonnie_(2022)\" following this outline:\n\n#Meteorological history\n#Preparations and impacts\n##Trinidad and Tobago\n##Mexico\n##Elsewhere\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

At the time, it was planned for Black Adam to be the villain in the 2019 film Shazam!, but Johnson's commitment to the role led to the character being spun off into his own solo film.\n\nIn 2017, Adam Sztykiel was hired to write the screenplay, with Rory Haines and Sohrab Noshirvani later joining as co-writers. Jaume Collet-Serra was brought on board to direct the film in June 2019, with filming set to begin in 2020.\n\n##Pre-production\n\nPre-production on Black Adam began in 2020, with the cast undergoing extensive training and preparation for their roles. Dwayne Johnson, in particular, underwent a rigorous workout routine to prepare for the physically demanding role of Black Adam.\n\nThe film's costume designer, Louise Frogley, worked closely with the cast and crew to create the iconic costumes for the characters. The film's production designer, Tom Meyer, built extensive sets in Atlanta, Georgia, where the majority of the film was shot.\n\n##Filming\n\nPrincipal photography on Black Adam began on April 9, 2021, and wrapped on July 15, 2021. The film was shot on location in Atlanta, Georgia, with additional filming taking place in Los Angeles and Cairo, Egypt.\n\nDuring filming, Dwayne Johnson performed many of his own stunts, including a memorable scene in which Black Adam takes on a group of Intergang mercenaries.\n\n##Post-production\n\nPost-production on Black Adam began in July 2021, with the film's editor, John Lee, working closely with director Jaume Collet-Serra to craft the final cut.\n\nThe film's visual effects were handled by the visual effects company, DNEG, with a team of over 1,000 artists and technicians working on the film's extensive visual effects.\n\n#Music\n\nThe score for Black Adam was composed by Lorne Balfe, who previously worked on the DC Extended Universe films Wonder Woman and Justice League.

He was a prominent figure in the socialist movement in the late 19th century and was known for his radical ideas on science, politics, and society.\n\n#Biography\n\n##Early years\n\nEdward Aveling was born on 29 November 1849 in Islington, London, to George Aveling, a Congregational minister, and his wife, Mary Ann.

He developed a strong interest in biology and chemistry, which would become the foundation of his future scientific work.\n\n##Cambridge\n\nIn 1870, Aveling moved to Cambridge University, where he continued his studies in natural sciences. During his time at Cambridge, he became increasingly interested in the emerging field of evolutionary biology and the work of Charles Darwin.\n\n##College of Preceptors\n\nAfter completing his studies, Aveling became a member of the College of Preceptors, a professional organization for teachers. This marked the beginning of his career as an educator and lecturer.\n\n##First marriage\n\nIn 1872, Aveling married Isabel Campbell, with whom he had two children. However, the marriage was short-lived, and the couple divorced in 1878.\n\n##Lecturer on Comparative Anatomy at London Hospital\n\nAveling's expertise in biology led to his appointment as a lecturer on comparative anatomy at London Hospital. This position allowed him to share his knowledge with students and further develop his scientific ideas.\n\n##New College, London\n\nIn 1880, Aveling became a lecturer at New College, London, where he taught a range of subjects, including biology, chemistry, and physics.\n\n##Professorship of English\n\nAveling's interests and expertise extended beyond science to literature and language. In 1884, he was appointed as a professor of English at the London University Extension.\n\n##Aveling's secularist credo\n\nAveling's rejection of Christianity and adoption of atheism led him to become a prominent figure in the secularist movement. He believed that science and reason should replace superstition and dogma.\n\n##National Secular Society and the Hall of Science\n\nAveling was an active member of the National Secular Society, which advocated for the separation of church and state. He was also involved in the establishment of the Hall of Science, a center for secularist education and debate.\n\n##Aveling as interim editor of Foote's Progress and The Freethinker\n\nIn 1883, Aveling became the interim editor of Foote's Progress, a radical magazine that advocated for social and political reform. He later edited The Freethinker, a magazine dedicated to promoting atheist and secularist ideas.\n\n##Political career\n\nAveling's involvement in the socialist movement led to his election as a member of the London School Board in 1886. He later became a member of the Socialist League, a Marxist organization founded by William Morris.\n\n##The American journey of agitation 1886\n\nIn 1886, Aveling traveled to the United States, where he lectured on socialism and evolution. This journey marked the beginning of his involvement in international socialist activism.\n\n##Second American journey of 1888\n\nAveling returned to the United States in 1888, where he continued to lecture and agitate for socialist causes.\n\n##Aveling as a Playwright\n\nAveling's literary talents extended to playwriting. He wrote several plays, including \"The Woman Question\" and \"The Cycle of Life\".\n\n##The Avelings and Ibsen\n\nAveling and his partner, Eleanor Marx, were great admirers of the Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen. They translated several of his plays into English and promoted his work in the UK.\n\n##Aveling and Darwin\n\nAveling was a great admirer of Charles Darwin and his work on evolution. He often incorporated Darwin's ideas into his own scientific and literary work.\n\n##Aveling and Haeckel\n\nAveling was also influenced by the German biologist Ernst Haeckel, who had developed the theory of recapitulation. Aveling saw Haeckel's work as a key component of the evolutionary narrative.\n\n##Aveling's publication of Darwin's letter to Marx\n\nIn 1880, Aveling published a letter written by Charles Darwin to Karl Marx, in which Darwin expressed his admiration for Marx's work. This publication highlighted the connection between evolutionary theory and socialist thought.\n\n##Later life, death and legacy\n\nAveling's later life was marked by personal and financial struggles. He died on 2 August 1898, at the age of 48, from a heart attack. His legacy as a scientist, writer, and socialist activist continues to be celebrated today.\n\n##Legacy\n\nAveling's contributions to science, literature, and socialism have had a lasting impact on modern thought. His work on evolution, his promotion of atheist and secularist ideas, and his involvement in the socialist movement have inspired generations of thinkers and activists.\n\n#Publications by Edward Aveling\n\n##Selected writings\n\n* \"The Student's Darwin\" (1881)\n* \"The Woman Question\" (1886)\n* \"The Cycle of Life\" (1888)\n\n##Scientific writings\n\n* \"The Evolution of Man\" (1884)\n* \"The Evolution of the Horse\" (1885)\n\n##Writings coauthored with Eleanor\n\n* \"The Eastern Question\" (1888)\n* \"The Woman Question in Europe and America\" (1888)\n\n##Translations\n\n* \"Hedda Gabler\" by Henrik Ibsen (1890)\n* \"The Master Builder\" by Henrik Ibsen (1892)\n\n#Notes\n\n#External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Edward_Aveling\" following this outline:\n\n#Biography\n##Early years\n##University College London\n##Cambridge\n##College of Preceptors\n##First marriage\n##Lecturer on Comparative Anatomy at London Hospital\n##New College, London\n##Professorship of English\n##Aveling's secularist credo\n##National Secular Society and the Hall of Science\n##Aveling as interim editor of Foote's Progress and The Freethinker\n##Political career\n##The American journey of agitation 1886\n##Second American journey of 1888\n##Aveling as a Playwright\n##The Avelings and Ibsen\n##Aveling and Darwin\n##Aveling and Haeckel\n##Aveling's publication of Darwin's letter to Marx\n##Later life, death and legacy\n##Legacy\n#Publications by Edward Aveling\n##Selected writings\n##Scientific writings\n##Writings coauthored with Eleanor\n##Translations\n#Notes\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The storm's history, preparations, and effects are detailed below.\n\n# Meteorological history\n\nHurricane Hilary originated from a tropical wave that emerged off the west coast of Africa on August 1, 2023. The wave traversed the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, eventually reaching the eastern Pacific Ocean on August 10. A low-pressure system developed within the wave, and by August 12, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring the system for potential tropical cyclone formation.\n\nOn August 14, the NHC classified the system as a tropical depression, which was then upgraded to Tropical Storm Hilary six hours later. Hilary continued to intensify, reaching hurricane strength on August 16. The storm's maximum sustained winds peaked at 140 mph (220 km/h) on August 18, making it a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.\n\nHilary began to weaken on August 19, due to increasing wind shear and cooler ocean waters. The storm made landfall in Mexico on August 20, bringing heavy rainfall and strong winds to the region. After crossing the Baja California Peninsula, Hilary re-emerged into the Pacific Ocean and continued to weaken, eventually dissipating on August 23.\n\n# Preparations\n\n## Mexico\n\nIn anticipation of Hilary's landfall, the Mexican government declared a state of emergency in several states, including Baja California Sur, Sinaloa, and Nayarit. Authorities evacuated thousands of residents and tourists from coastal areas, particularly in the cities of Cabo San Lucas and La Paz. The Mexican Navy and Army were deployed to assist with evacuations and provide emergency services.\n\n## United States\n\nThe National Weather Service (NWS) issued tropical storm watches and warnings for parts of California, Arizona, and Nevada. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) activated its Incident Management Assistance Team to support state and local authorities.\n\nIn California, Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency, mobilizing the California National Guard and emergency response teams. The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) closed several highways and roads due to heavy rainfall and flooding concerns.\n\n# Impact\n\n## Mexico\n\nHilary's landfall in Mexico brought significant impacts, particularly in the states of Baja California Sur and Sinaloa. The storm's strong winds and heavy rainfall caused widespread power outages, with over 100,000 households affected. Flooding was reported in several cities, including La Paz and Cabo San Lucas, with some areas receiving over 10 inches (250 mm) of rainfall.\n\nThe Mexican government reported at least 10 fatalities directly attributed to the storm, with many more injured. The economic impact was significant, with estimated damages of over $1 billion.\n\n## United States\n\n### California\n\nHilary's effects in California were significant, particularly in the southern and central regions. Heavy rainfall caused flash flooding in several areas, including the cities of Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Bernardino. The storm's strong winds led to power outages, with over 50,000 households affected.\n\nThe California Department of Water Resources reported that several rivers, including the San Joaquin and Sacramento rivers, exceeded their flood stages. The storm's heavy rainfall also led to significant agricultural losses, with estimated damages of over $500 million.\n\n### Elsewhere\n\nIn Arizona, the storm brought heavy rainfall and strong winds, causing power outages and flooding in several areas. The city of Phoenix reported over 2 inches (50 mm) of rainfall, with some areas receiving over 4 inches (100 mm).\n\nIn Nevada, the storm's effects were relatively minimal, with some areas reporting light rainfall and gusty winds.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe aftermath of Hurricane Hilary saw a significant response from emergency services and aid organizations. In Mexico, the government deployed troops and aid to affected areas, with many residents receiving food, shelter, and medical assistance.\n\nIn the United States, FEMA and state authorities provided aid to affected areas, including California, Arizona, and Nevada. The American Red Cross and other aid organizations also provided support, including shelter, food, and emotional support.\n\nThe economic impact of the storm was significant, with estimated damages of over $2 billion in Mexico and the United States. However, the storm also highlighted the importance of disaster preparedness and response, with many residents and authorities praising the efforts of emergency services and aid organizations.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of Category 4 Pacific hurricanes\n* List of California hurricanes\n* 2023 Pacific hurricane season\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a factual account of Hurricane Hilary's history, preparations, and impacts.

The comments were widely condemned by Muslim leaders and organizations, who demanded action against the two politicians.\n\n# Police cases\n\nFollowing the outrage, police cases were filed against Sharma and Jindal in several states, including Delhi, Maharashtra, and Uttar Pradesh. The cases were filed under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, including Section 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion) and Section 295A (deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings). Sharma and Jindal were also suspended from the BJP, pending an inquiry.\n\n# Protests and violence\n\nThe comments sparked widespread protests and violence across India and several other countries.

The OIC demanded action against Sharma and Jindal and called on the Indian government to take steps to prevent such incidents in the future.\n\n# Indian government response\n\nThe Indian government responded to the controversy by saying that Sharma's comments were \"not the view of the government\". The government also said that it respected all religions and was committed to maintaining communal harmony.\n\n# BJP response\n\nThe BJP responded to the controversy by saying that Sharma's comments were \"unacceptable and unbecoming\".

Pant was given out by the on-field umpire, but he was not convinced and asked for a review. The third umpire, however, upheld the decision, leading to Pant's dismissal.\n\n#Points table\n\n| Team | Pld | W | L | NR | Pts | NRR |\n| Gujarat Titans | 14 | 10 | 4 | 0 | 20 | +0.316 |\n| Rajasthan Royals | 14 | 9 | 5 | 0 | 18 | +0.298 |\n| Lucknow Super Giants | 14 | 9 | 5 | 0 | 18 | +0.251 |\n| Royal Challengers Bangalore | 14 | 8 | 6 | 0 | 16 | -0.253 |\n| Delhi Capitals | 14 | 7 | 7 | 0 | 14 | +0.204 |\n| Punjab Kings | 14 | 7 | 7 | 0 | 14 | +0.126 |\n| Kolkata Knight Riders | 14 | 6 | 8 | 0 | 12 | +0.146 |\n| Sunrisers Hyderabad | 14 | 6 | 8 | 0 | 12 | -0.379 |\n| Chennai Super Kings | 14 | 4 | 10 | 0 | 8 | -0.203 |\n| Mumbai Indians | 14 | 4 | 10 | 0 | 8 | -0.506 |\n\n##Match summary\n\nThe Gujarat Titans topped the points table with 20 points, winning 10 out of their 14 matches.

The club was founded in 1889 and is one of the oldest and most successful football clubs in India. Mohun Bagan has a rich history, having won numerous domestic and international titles, and has produced many notable players who have represented the Indian national team.\n\n**History**\n\n### Early years (1889–99)\n\nMohun Bagan was founded in 1889 by a group of Bengali aristocrats, including Bhupendra Nath Bose, Jyotindra Nath Bose, and Sir Bhupendra Nath Mitra. The club was initially known as Mohun Bagan Sporting Club and was affiliated with the Indian Football Association (IFA). In its early years, the club played friendly matches against other local teams and participated in local tournaments.\n\n### Administrative and tactical overhaul under Subedar-major Sailen Basu (1900s)\n\nIn the early 1900s, Subedar-major Sailen Basu, a former British Indian Army officer, took over as the club's secretary. Basu introduced modern coaching methods and tactics, which helped the club improve its performance. Under Basu's leadership, Mohun Bagan won its first major title, the Cooch Behar Cup, in 1904.\n\n### The historic year of 1911\n\n1911 was a historic year for Mohun Bagan, as the club won its first Indian Football Association Shield title, defeating the East Yorkshire Regiment 2-1 in the final. This victory marked a turning point in the club's history, as it established Mohun Bagan as a major force in Indian football.\n\n### Nation-wide exposure of the club (1912–30)\n\nIn the 1910s and 1920s, Mohun Bagan toured various parts of India, playing friendly matches against local teams. This helped to increase the club's popularity and exposure across the country. During this period, Mohun Bagan also participated in several national tournaments, including the Durand Cup and the Rovers Cup.\n\n### Significant contributions to the national team (1931–47)\n\nMohun Bagan has produced many notable players who have represented the Indian national team. In the 1930s and 1940s, players like Gostho Paul, Karuna Sankar Bhattacharya, and Sailen Manna played for both Mohun Bagan and the national team. These players helped India win several international titles, including the 1951 Asian Games football tournament.\n\n### Struggle with consistency (1948–1950s)\n\nAfter India gained independence in 1947, Mohun Bagan struggled to maintain its consistency. The club faced stiff competition from other teams, including East Bengal and Calcutta Customs.

The exercises were widely seen as a response to the visit of United States Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan on August 2-3, 2022, which China strongly opposed.\n\n#Background\n\n##Incursions into Taiwan ADIZ\n\nIn recent years, China has increased its military presence around Taiwan, with frequent incursions into Taiwan's Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ). The ADIZ is an area of airspace surrounding Taiwan where the Taiwanese military requires aircraft to identify themselves. China's incursions into the ADIZ have been seen as a way to test Taiwan's defenses and assert China's claims of sovereignty over the island.\n\n##Escalation of tensions\n\nTensions between China and Taiwan have been escalating in recent years, with China increasingly pressuring Taiwan to accept its \"one country, two systems\" framework, which Taiwan has rejected. The visit of Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan in August 2022 was seen as a significant escalation of tensions, as China had warned that such a visit would be met with severe consequences.\n\n#Military exercises\n\nIn response to Pelosi's visit, China announced a series of military exercises to be held in the waters and airspace surrounding Taiwan. The exercises began on August 4, 2022, and were scheduled to last for several days. The exercises included live-fire drills, missile launches, and other military activities, and were seen as a demonstration of China's military capabilities and its determination to defend its claims of sovereignty over Taiwan.\n\nThe exercises were widely condemned by Taiwan and other countries, which saw them as a provocative and destabilizing move. The exercises also raised concerns about the risk of miscalculation or accident, which could lead to a wider conflict.\n\n#Reactions\n\n##Japan\n\nJapan, which has a security alliance with the United States, condemned China's military exercises and called for restraint. Japan's Defense Minister, Nobuo Kishi, said that Japan was \"closely monitoring\" the situation and was prepared to respond to any developments.\n\n##North Korea\n\nNorth Korea, which has a close relationship with China, welcomed China's military exercises and said that they were a \"just\" response to Pelosi's visit. North Korea's state media said that the exercises were a demonstration of China's military power and its commitment to defending its sovereignty.\n\n##Russia\n\nRussia, which has a strategic partnership with China, supported China's military exercises and said that they were a legitimate response to Pelosi's visit. Russia's Foreign Ministry said that the exercises were a demonstration of China's military capabilities and its determination to defend its interests.\n\n##United States\n\nThe United States, which has a security alliance with Taiwan, condemned China's military exercises and called for restraint. The US State Department said that the exercises were a \"provocative\" move that was \"unacceptable\" and called on China to \"cease\" its military activities.\n\n#Aftermath\n\nThe 2022 Chinese military exercises around Taiwan were widely seen as a significant escalation of tensions between China and Taiwan, and raised concerns about the risk of a wider conflict. The exercises were also seen as a demonstration of China's military capabilities and its determination to defend its claims of sovereignty over Taiwan.\n\nThe aftermath of the exercises saw a series of diplomatic efforts to reduce tensions, including talks between the United States and China. However, the underlying issues that led to the exercises remain unresolved, and tensions between China and Taiwan continue to be a major concern for regional and global stability.\n\n#See also\n\n* Cross-Strait relations\n* People's Liberation Army\n* Taiwanese Air Defense Identification Zone\n* United States-Taiwan relations\n* China-United States relations", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Chinese_military_exercises_around_Taiwan\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Incursions into Taiwan ADIZ\n##Escalation of tensions\n#Military exercises\n#Reactions\n##Japan\n##North Korea\n##Russia\n##United States\n#Aftermath\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This group is characterized by their unique blend of analog and digital experiences, shaped by the rapid technological advancements and societal shifts of the 21st century.\n\nEtymology\n----------\n\nThe term \"Zillennials\" is a portmanteau of \"Z\" (from Generation Z) and \"Millennials.\" It was first coined in the mid-2010s to describe individuals who do not fit neatly into either generation, but rather share characteristics from both. The term gained popularity as researchers, marketers, and media outlets sought to better understand the distinct experiences and preferences of this microgeneration.\n\nBirth Date and Age Range\n-------------------------\n\nZillennials are generally considered to be those born between 1997 and 2003, although some researchers extend the age range to include individuals born as early as 1995 or as late as 2005. This age range allows for a nuanced understanding of the microgeneration's experiences, as they grew up during a time of significant technological and societal change.\n\nCharacteristics\n---------------\n\n### Arts and Culture\n\nZillennials have a unique relationship with arts and culture, having grown up during a time of rapid digitalization and increased access to creative content. They are more likely to engage with online platforms, such as social media and streaming services, to discover and consume art, music, and literature. This has led to the rise of new forms of creative expression, such as TikTok videos and Instagram art, which are often characterized by their ephemeral and experiential nature.\n\nZillennials are also more likely to engage with retro and vintage culture, as they seek to connect with the past and find meaning in a rapidly changing world. This is reflected in the resurgence of vinyl records, vintage clothing, and classic video games, which have become staples of Zillennial culture.\n\n### Economic Activity\n\nZillennials are entering the workforce during a time of significant economic uncertainty and change. They are more likely to prioritize flexibility and work-life balance, seeking careers that offer autonomy and creative freedom. This has led to the rise of the gig economy and remote work, as Zillennials seek to navigate the challenges of modern employment.\n\nZillennials are also more likely to be financially cautious, having grown up during the Great Recession and witnessing the student loan debt crisis. They are more likely to prioritize saving and investing, seeking to build secure financial futures in an uncertain world.\n\n### Health\n\nZillennials are growing up during a time of significant health concerns, including the COVID-19 pandemic, mental health crises, and rising rates of obesity and chronic disease. They are more likely to prioritize self-care and wellness, seeking to maintain healthy lifestyles and manage stress.\n\nZillennials are also more likely to engage with online health resources and communities, seeking to educate themselves about health topics and connect with others who share similar experiences. This has led to the rise of health influencers and online support groups, which have become important sources of information and support for Zillennials.\n\n### Personal Values\n\nZillennials are characterized by their strong sense of social justice and activism, having grown up during a time of significant social and environmental change. They are more likely to prioritize issues such as climate change, racial equality, and LGBTQ+ rights, seeking to create a more just and equitable world.\n\nZillennials are also more likely to prioritize authenticity and individuality, seeking to express themselves and live authentically in a world that often values conformity. This has led to the rise of alternative fashion and beauty standards, as Zillennials seek to challenge traditional norms and expectations.\n\n### Political Activity\n\nZillennials are growing up during a time of significant political polarization and social unrest, having witnessed the rise of populist movements and the decline of traditional political institutions. They are more likely to prioritize issues such as climate change, economic inequality, and social justice, seeking to create a more just and equitable world.\n\nZillennials are also more likely to engage with online activism and social media campaigns, seeking to raise awareness about important issues and mobilize support for social causes. This has led to the rise of online activism and hashtag campaigns, which have become important tools for Zillennials seeking to create social change.\n\n### Social Life\n\nZillennials are growing up during a time of significant social change, having witnessed the rise of social media and the decline of traditional social institutions. They are more likely to prioritize online relationships and communities, seeking to connect with others who share similar interests and experiences.\n\nZillennials are also more likely to engage with online gaming and entertainment, seeking to escape the stresses of modern life and connect with others who share similar interests. This has led to the rise of online gaming communities and esports, which have become important sources of social connection and entertainment for Zillennials.\n\n### Technology\n\nZillennials are growing up during a time of rapid technological advancement, having witnessed the rise of smartphones, social media, and artificial intelligence. They are more likely to prioritize online safety and security, seeking to protect themselves from cyber threats and online harassment.\n\nZillennials are also more likely to engage with emerging technologies such as virtual reality, augmented reality, and blockchain, seeking to explore new frontiers of innovation and creativity. This has led to the rise of tech entrepreneurship and innovation, as Zillennials seek to create new products and services that meet the needs of a rapidly changing world.\n\nSee Also\n--------\n\n* Generation Z\n* Millennials\n* Microgeneration\n* Digital native\n\nFurther Reading\n---------------\n\n* \"The Zillennial's Guide to the Future\" by Emily Chen\n* \"Zillennials: The New Generation of Entrepreneurs\" by Forbes\n* \"The Zillennial's Guide to Mental Health\" by The Mighty\n* \"Zillennials: The New Generation of Activists\" by The Guardian", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Zillennials\" following this outline:\n\n#Etymology\n#Birth date and age range\n#Characteristics\n##Arts and culture\n##Economic activity\n##Health\n##Personal values\n##Political activity\n##Social life\n##Technology\n#See also\n#References\n#Further reading\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The Chief Electoral Officer of Alberta was responsible for administering the election and ensuring that it was conducted in accordance with the Act.\n\nElectoral System\n\nAlberta uses a first-past-the-post electoral system, in which the candidate with the most votes in each electoral district is elected as the Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for that district. The province is divided into 87 electoral districts, each of which elects one MLA.\n\nTimeline\n\n### 2019\n\nThe 2019 Alberta general election was held on April 16, 2019, and resulted in the election of a United Conservative Party government led by Premier Jason Kenney.

The issue sparked widespread protests, violence, and a heated debate on social media, eventually reaching the courts and garnering international attention.\n\n# Background\n\nThe hijab has been a part of Islamic tradition for centuries, and its wearing is considered an essential aspect of modesty and piety by many Muslim women. In India, the hijab is commonly worn by Muslim women, particularly in conservative and traditional communities. However, in recent years, there has been a growing trend of young Muslim women in India choosing not to wear the hijab, citing personal freedom and modernity.\n\nIn Karnataka, the hijab has been a topic of debate in educational institutions, particularly in colleges and universities. While some institutions have allowed Muslim female students to wear the hijab, others have banned it, citing dress code regulations.\n\n# Events\n\n## Udupi Dispute\n\nThe controversy began in January 2022, at a government-run college in Udupi, a town in coastal Karnataka. A group of six Muslim female students, led by a 17-year-old girl, approached the college principal, requesting permission to wear the hijab to class. However, the principal refused, citing the college's dress code policy, which mandated a uniform for all students.\n\nThe students refused to remove their hijabs, leading to a standoff with college authorities. The issue quickly gained attention on social media, with many users supporting the students' right to wear the hijab.\n\n## Saffron Protests\n\nIn response to the Udupi dispute, a group of Hindu students, allegedly affiliated with the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), a right-wing student organization, began protesting against the hijab, wearing saffron scarves and shouting slogans. The protests quickly spread to other colleges in Karnataka, with many students, including some Muslim students, joining in.\n\n## Government Reaction\n\nThe Karnataka government, led by Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, initially maintained that the hijab was not a part of the school uniform and that students should follow the dress code. However, as the protests escalated, the government issued a statement saying that it would not impose a ban on the hijab, but would instead allow individual colleges to decide on their dress code policies.\n\n## Fallout\n\nThe controversy led to a significant fallout, with many Muslim students feeling targeted and intimidated. Some students reported being heckled and harassed by their peers, while others said they were forced to remove their hijabs by college authorities.\n\n# Petitions in the High Court\n\n## Religious Rights\n\nA group of Muslim students, led by the six students who had initially approached the Udupi college principal, filed a petition in the Karnataka High Court, arguing that the hijab was an essential part of their religious practice and that banning it was a violation of their fundamental right to freedom of religion.\n\n## Government Order\n\nThe Karnataka government issued an order, stating that students could wear the hijab, but only if it was part of the college's uniform. However, the order was widely criticized as ambiguous and ineffective.\n\n## College Development Committees\n\nThe state government also ordered college development committees to decide on dress code policies, leading to further confusion and inconsistencies.\n\n## Udupi College and Other Institutions\n\nThe Udupi college, where the controversy began, eventually allowed students to wear the hijab, but only after the intervention of the High Court. However, some other colleges in Karnataka continued to ban the hijab, leading to ongoing protests and controversy.\n\n# High Court Verdict\n\nThe Karnataka High Court issued a verdict, stating that the hijab was not an essential part of Islam and that banning it was not a violation of the fundamental right to freedom of religion. The verdict was widely criticized by Muslim groups and human rights organizations.\n\n# Supreme Court\n\nThe case was eventually appealed to the Supreme Court of India, which issued a stay on the High Court verdict, allowing Muslim students to wear the hijab to class.\n\n# Violence\n\nThe controversy led to widespread violence, particularly in coastal Karnataka, where Muslim and Hindu communities clashed. Several people were injured, and property was damaged.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## Domestic\n\nThe controversy sparked a heated debate on social media, with many users expressing support for the Muslim students' right to wear the hijab. However, others argued that the hijab was a symbol of Islamic fundamentalism and that banning it was necessary to promote secularism.\n\n## International\n\nThe controversy gained international attention, with many human rights organizations and countries expressing concern over the treatment of Muslim students in Karnataka.\n\n## Ministry of External Affairs (MEA)\n\nThe Indian Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) issued a statement, saying that India was a secular country and that the government was committed to protecting the rights of all citizens, including Muslim students.\n\n# Impact\n\nThe controversy had a significant impact on Muslim students in Karnataka, many of whom felt targeted and intimidated. The controversy also led to a wider debate on the role of religion in public life and the limits of freedom of expression.\n\n# Rescission\n\nThe controversy eventually died down, but not before leaving a lasting impact on the social and political landscape of Karnataka.\n\n# See also\n\n* Islam in India\n* Hijab\n* Secularism in India\n* Freedom of religion in India\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a factual account of the 2022 Karnataka hijab row, based on publicly available information.\n\n# References\n\nThis article does not include any references, as per the requirements.\n\n# Bibliography\n\nThis article does not include any bibliography, as per the requirements.\n\n# External links\n\nThis article does not include any external links, as per the requirements.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Karnataka_hijab_row\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Events\n##Udupi dispute\n##Saffron protests\n##Government reaction\n##Fallout\n#Petitions in the High Court\n##Religious rights\n##Government order\n##College development committees\n##Udupi college and other institutions\n#High Court verdict\n#Supreme Court\n#Violence\n#Reactions\n##Domestic\n##International\n##Ministry of External Affairs (MEA)\n#Impact\n#Rescission\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The county palatine was a unique administrative and territorial entity that held a special status within the Kingdom of England, with the Bishop of Durham exercising significant powers and authority over the area. In this article, we will explore the history, administration, and legacy of the County Palatine of Durham.\n\n# History\n\n## Early History\n\nThe County Palatine of Durham has its roots in the early medieval period. Following the Norman Conquest of 1066, William the Conqueror granted the Bishop of Durham, William de St-Calais, extensive powers and lands in the north-east of England. The bishop was tasked with defending the region against the Scottish threat and maintaining order in the area. Over time, the bishop's powers and authority grew, and the County Palatine of Durham began to take shape as a distinct administrative entity.\n\n## Establishment and Consolidation\n\nIn the 12th century, the County Palatine of Durham was formally established through a series of charters and grants issued by the English monarchs. The most significant of these was the charter issued by King Henry I in 1108, which granted the Bishop of Durham the right to govern the county and exercise jurisdiction over its inhabitants. The charter also established the bishop's authority over the county's administration, including taxation, law enforcement, and the appointment of officials.\n\nThroughout the Middle Ages, the County Palatine of Durham continued to consolidate its powers and authority. The bishop's control over the county was cemented through a series of agreements and treaties with the English monarchs, which recognized the bishop's right to govern the county and exercise jurisdiction over its inhabitants. The county's unique status was also reflected in its administrative structure, which was distinct from other counties in England.\n\n## Decline and Abolition\n\nThe County Palatine of Durham began to decline in the 16th century, as the English monarchs began to assert their authority over the county. The Tudor monarchs, in particular, sought to reduce the bishop's powers and authority, and to bring the county under the direct control of the crown. In 1536, the English Parliament passed the Act of Supremacy, which abolished the bishop's jurisdiction over the county and established the English monarch as the supreme authority.\n\nThe County Palatine of Durham was finally abolished in 1836, when the English Parliament passed the Durham (County Palatine) Act. The act abolished the county's unique status and brought it under the direct control of the English crown. The bishop's powers and authority were significantly reduced, and the county was reorganized into a standard English county.\n\n# Administration\n\n## Taxation\n\nThe County Palatine of Durham had its own unique system of taxation, which was separate from the English crown. The bishop had the power to raise taxes and tolls within the county, and to expend the revenue on the county's administration and defense. The county's taxation system was based on a series of charters and grants issued by the English monarchs, which recognized the bishop's right to govern the county and exercise jurisdiction over its inhabitants.\n\n## Government and Courts\n\nThe County Palatine of Durham had its own system of government and courts, which was separate from the English crown. The bishop was the chief executive and judicial authority in the county, and had the power to appoint officials and judges. The county's courts were responsible for trying cases and administering justice within the county, and were based on a series of charters and grants issued by the English monarchs.\n\n# St Cuthbert and the haliwerfolc\n\nThe County Palatine of Durham was closely associated with St Cuthbert, a 7th-century saint who was revered throughout medieval England. The bishop's authority over the county was partly based on the saint's reputation and the bishop's role as the guardian of the saint's shrine. The county's inhabitants were also known as the \"haliwerfolc,\" or \"holy people,\" in reference to their devotion to St Cuthbert.\n\n# Legacy\n\nThe County Palatine of Durham played a significant role in the history of medieval England, and its legacy continues to be felt today. The county's unique status and administrative structure have influenced the development of local government in England, and its association with St Cuthbert has made it a place of pilgrimage and devotion for centuries. Despite its abolition in 1836, the County Palatine of Durham remains an important part of English history and culture.\n\n# References\n## Citations", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"County_Palatine_of_Durham\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Early history\n##Establishment and consolidation\n##Decline and abolition\n#Administration\n##Taxation\n##Government and courts\n#St Cuthbert and the haliwerfolc\n#Legacy\n#References\n##Citations\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This vast repository of iconographic knowledge was a groundbreaking work that systematically categorized and documented the likenesses of prominent individuals, making it an invaluable resource for historians, artists, and scholars.\n\nIconographic Bases and Authorship\n---------------------------------\n\n### Guillaume Rouillé: The Compiler\n\nGuillaume Rouillé was a French historian, numismatist, and publisher who lived in Lyon during the 16th century. Born around 1518, Rouillé was a prolific writer and compiler of historical works, and his Promptuarium Iconum Insigniorum is considered one of his most notable achievements. Rouillé's expertise in numismatics and his access to extensive collections of coins and medals from ancient Greece and Rome provided the foundation for his iconographic research.\n\n### Iconographic Sources\n\nRouillé drew upon a wide range of sources to compile the Promptuarium Iconum Insigniorum, including ancient coins, medals, busts, and other sculptures. He also consulted literary works, such as Plutarch's Parallel Lives and Suetonius' The Twelve Caesars, to gather information about the lives and appearances of the individuals featured in his collection. Additionally, Rouillé incorporated contemporary portraits and engravings of notable figures from his own time, making the Promptuarium a unique blend of ancient and modern iconography.\n\nPublication History\n-------------------\n\nThe Promptuarium Iconum Insigniorum was first published in Lyon in 1553, with subsequent editions appearing in 1577 and 1598. The initial publication consisted of three volumes, containing a total of 1,068 woodcut portraits, accompanied by brief biographical descriptions and explanatory notes. Rouillé's work was a groundbreaking achievement in the field of iconography, as it provided a systematic and comprehensive collection of images and descriptions of notable figures from ancient and modern times.\n\n### Editions and Reprints\n\nThe Promptuarium Iconum Insigniorum underwent several revisions and expansions during Rouillé's lifetime, with new editions incorporating additional portraits and updated information. After Rouillé's death, the work was reprinted and revised by other publishers, who added new content and updated the existing material. These later editions helped to disseminate the Promptuarium's iconographic knowledge to a wider audience, cementing its reputation as a fundamental resource for historians and scholars.\n\nReception\n----------\n\nThe Promptuarium Iconum Insigniorum received widespread acclaim upon its initial publication, with scholars and historians praising its comprehensive scope and meticulous attention to detail. The work's systematic categorization and documentation of iconographic knowledge made it an invaluable resource for researchers, artists, and writers.\n\n### Influence on Art and Literature\n\nThe Promptuarium Iconum Insigniorum had a significant impact on the development of art and literature in the 16th and 17th centuries. The work's iconographic images and descriptions influenced the creation of portraits, sculptures, and other artworks, while its biographical information and historical context provided inspiration for literary works, such as plays and poems. The Promptuarium's influence can be seen in the works of artists like Peter Paul Rubens and Anthony Van Dyck, who drew upon Rouillé's iconographic research for their own portraits and historical compositions.\n\nSee Also\n--------\n\n* Iconography\n* Numismatics\n* Guillaume Rouillé\n* Ancient Greek and Roman Portraiture\n* Renaissance Art and Literature\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nThis article is a comprehensive overview of the Promptuarium Iconum Insigniorum, its authorship, publication history, reception, and influence.

The system was characterized by strong winds, heavy rainfall, and significant storm surge. Batsirai brought widespread damage and disruption to the affected regions, particularly in Madagascar, where the cyclone made landfall.\n\nMeteorological History\n-------------------\n\nCyclone Batsirai formed as a tropical disturbance in the southwestern Indian Ocean on January 24, 2022. The system gradually intensified as it moved westward, fueled by warm ocean waters and favorable atmospheric conditions. On January 27, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) upgraded the disturbance to a tropical storm, assigning it the name Batsirai.\n\nOver the next few days, Batsirai continued to strengthen, developing a well-defined eye and a symmetrical cloud pattern. On February 1, the cyclone reached Category 3 strength on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, with sustained winds of 185 km/h (115 mph). Batsirai's maximum intensity was reached on February 2, with winds of 220 km/h (140 mph) and a central pressure of 955 hPa (28.20 inHg).\n\nPreparations\n------------\n\n### Mauritius\n\nAs Cyclone Batsirai approached Mauritius, the national meteorological service issued a Class III cyclone warning, indicating a high risk of damage and disruption.

The theory centers around an anonymous figure known as \"Q\" who claims to have access to classified information about the government and other powerful entities. QAnon adherents believe that Q is a high-ranking government official or a group of officials working to take down a supposed cabal of child sex traffickers, satanists, and corrupt politicians.\n\nBackground\n------------\n\n### Pizzagate\n\nQAnon draws heavily from Pizzagate, a conspiracy theory that emerged in 2016. Pizzagate claimed that Hillary Clinton and other high-ranking Democrats were running a child sex trafficking ring out of a pizzeria in Washington, D.C. The theory was thoroughly debunked, but it laid the groundwork for QAnon's more elaborate conspiracy narrative.\n\n### Influence of 4chan culture\n\nQAnon emerged on 4chan's /pol/ board, a hub for far-right and white nationalist discourse. The board's culture of anonymity, irony, and nihilism influenced the development of QAnon, which often employs cryptic language and absurd claims.\n\n### Previous \"anons\"\n\nQAnon is not the first conspiracy theory to emerge from 4chan. Previous \"anons\" such as \"FBIAnon\" and \"CIAAnon\" claimed to be government insiders leaking classified information. However, QAnon's longevity and widespread appeal set it apart from its predecessors.\n\nOrigin and spread\n-----------------\n\n### Mainstream attention\n\nQAnon gained mainstream attention in 2018, when adherents began appearing at Donald Trump's rallies wearing Q-themed merchandise. The theory's popularity grew rapidly, with QAnon-related hashtags trending on Twitter and prominent YouTubers promoting the theory.\n\n### International following\n\nQAnon has attracted a significant following outside the United States, particularly in the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia. International adherents often adapt QAnon to fit local concerns and conspiracy theories.\n\n### Pastel QAnon\n\nIn 2020, a variant of QAnon emerged known as \"Pastel QAnon.\" This version of the theory emphasizes the importance of personal wellness, spirituality, and community-building, often using softer, more feminine language. Pastel QAnon has attracted a significant following among women and has been criticized for co-opting feminist and wellness discourse.\n\nClaims\n--------\n\n### Q's posts\n\nQ communicates with adherents through a series of cryptic posts on 4chan and other online platforms. These posts often contain coded language, references to conspiracy theories, and predictions of upcoming events.\n\n### The cabal and \"the Storm\"\n\nQAnon adherents believe that a powerful cabal of child sex traffickers, satanists, and corrupt politicians controls the government and other institutions.

He was nominated by President George H. W. Bush and took office on October 23, 1991. Thomas is the second African American to serve on the Court, after Thurgood Marshall. He is known for his conservative and originalist judicial philosophy.\n\nEarly Life\n-----------\n\nClarence Thomas was born on June 23, 1948, in Pin Point, Georgia, a small community near Savannah. His father abandoned the family when Thomas was two years old, and his mother, Leola Williams, raised him and his brother in a low-income household. Thomas's early life was marked by poverty and hardship, but his mother encouraged his educational pursuits.\n\nCollege of the Holy Cross and Yale Law School\n-------------------------------------------\n\nThomas attended the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, where he graduated cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English literature in 1971. He then attended Yale Law School, where he earned his Juris Doctor degree in 1974. Thomas has spoken publicly about the challenges he faced as a black student at Yale, including feeling isolated and struggling to find his place in the predominantly white environment.\n\nEarly Legal Career\n-----------------\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Thomas worked as an assistant attorney general in Missouri from 1974 to 1977. He then moved to Washington, D.C. to work as a legislative assistant to Senator John Danforth from 1977 to 1979. In 1979, Thomas joined the law firm of Monsanto Company as an attorney, where he worked until 1981.\n\nDistrict of Columbia Court of Appeals\n----------------------------------\n\nIn 1982, Thomas was nominated by President Ronald Reagan to serve on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. He was confirmed by the Senate on March 6, 1982, and served on the court until 1990.\n\nNomination to the Supreme Court\n-----------------------------\n\nOn July 1, 1991, President George H. W. Bush nominated Thomas to replace retiring Justice Thurgood Marshall on the Supreme Court. Thomas's nomination was met with opposition from some liberal groups, who questioned his conservative judicial philosophy and his lack of experience on the federal bench.\n\nAnita Hill Accusations\n---------------------\n\nDuring Thomas's confirmation hearings, Anita Hill, a former employee of Thomas's at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), accused him of sexual harassment. Hill alleged that Thomas had made unwanted advances and comments of a sexual nature during her time working with him.\n\n### Second Hearing\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee held a second hearing to address Hill's allegations, during which Thomas denied the accusations and called them a \"high-tech lynching.\" The hearing was widely covered in the media, and Thomas's testimony was seen as a turning point in the confirmation process.\n\nSenate Votes\n------------\n\nOn October 15, 1991, the Senate voted to confirm Thomas's nomination, with a vote of 52-48. Thomas was sworn in as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court on October 23, 1991.\n\nSupreme Court of the United States\n---------------------------------\n\n### Government Powers and Legal Structure\n\nThomas has been a consistent advocate for limited government and individual rights. He has argued that the Constitution grants specific powers to the federal government, and that any powers not explicitly granted are reserved to the states or the people.\n\n#### Court Precedent\n\nThomas has been critical of the Court's reliance on precedent, arguing that it can lead to decisions that are not grounded in the Constitution or the law. He has advocated for a more originalist approach, which would involve interpreting the Constitution as it was written and intended by the Founders.\n\n#### Executive Power\n\nThomas has been a strong supporter of executive power, arguing that the President has broad authority to act in the national interest. He has upheld executive actions in cases such as Hamdi v. Rumsfeld (2004), which involved the detention of enemy combatants.\n\n#### Federalism and States' Rights\n\nThomas has been a strong advocate for federalism and states' rights. He has argued that the Constitution grants specific powers to the federal government, and that any powers not explicitly granted are reserved to the states or the people.\n\nIndividual Rights\n----------------\n\n### First Amendment\n\nThomas has been a strong supporter of First Amendment rights, including freedom of speech and freedom of the press. He has argued that the government has a limited role in regulating speech, and that any regulations must be narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling government interest.\n\n### Second Amendment\n\nThomas has been a strong supporter of Second Amendment rights, including the right to bear arms. He has argued that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to own and possess firearms, and that any regulations must be narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling government interest.\n\n### Fourth Amendment\n\nThomas has been a strong supporter of Fourth Amendment rights, including the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. He has argued that the government must have probable cause before conducting a search, and that any search must be narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling government interest.\n\n### Sixth Amendment\n\nThomas has been a strong supporter of Sixth Amendment rights, including the right to a fair trial and the right to effective assistance of counsel. He has argued that the government must provide adequate funding for defense counsel, and that any convictions must be based on reliable evidence.\n\n### Eighth Amendment\n\nThomas has been a strong supporter of Eighth Amendment rights, including the right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment. He has argued that the government must provide adequate medical care and housing for prisoners, and that any punishments must be narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling government interest.\n\n### Fourteenth Amendment\n\nThomas has been a strong supporter of Fourteenth Amendment rights, including the right to equal protection under the law. He has argued that the government must provide equal treatment for all citizens, regardless of race, sex, or national origin.\n\n### Abortion and Family Planning\n\nThomas has been a strong opponent of abortion, arguing that it is not a constitutional right. He has upheld regulations on abortion, including parental notification requirements and waiting periods.\n\n### LGBTQ Rights\n\nThomas has been a strong opponent of LGBTQ rights, arguing that they are not constitutionally protected. He has upheld laws that discriminate against LGBTQ individuals, including laws that prohibit same-sex marriage.\n\nOral Arguments\n--------------\n\nThomas is known for his quiet and minimalist approach to oral arguments. He rarely asks questions, preferring to listen to the arguments of counsel and deliberate on the issues.\n\nPersonal Life\n-------------\n\n### Family\n\nThomas is married to Virginia Lamp, a conservative activist and lobbyist. They have one son, Jamal Adeen Thomas, who was born in 1973.\n\n### Religion\n\nThomas is a devout Catholic, and has spoken publicly about the importance of his faith in his life. He has also been critical of the Catholic Church's handling of the sex abuse scandal.\n\n### Literary Influences\n\nThomas has cited Ayn Rand and Friedrich Hayek as influential thinkers in his life. He has also been influenced by the works of Martin Luther King Jr. and Frederick Douglass.\n\n### Moira Smith Allegations\n\nIn 2017, Moira Smith, a former girlfriend of Thomas's, accused him of making unwanted advances and comments of a sexual nature. Thomas denied the allegations, calling them \"false and ridiculous.\"\n\n### Nondisclosure of Finances\n\nThomas has been criticized for failing to disclose his wife's income from her lobbying work. He has argued that he is not required to disclose her income, and that any criticism is unfair and partisan.\n\nHonors and Recognition\n----------------------\n\nThomas has received numerous honors and awards for his service on the Supreme Court. He has been recognized for his commitment to public service, his advocacy for individual rights, and his leadership on the Court.\n\nIn Popular Culture\n------------------\n\nThomas has been portrayed in several films and television shows, including the movie \"Marshall\" (2017) and the TV series \"The Good Wife\" (2009-2016).\n\nWritings\n--------\n\nThomas has written several books and articles on law and politics.

She was one of the most successful and popular entertainers of all time, with a career spanning over five decades. Newton-John was known for her iconic voice, captivating stage presence, and commitment to philanthropy.\n\nEarly Life and Family\n-------------------\n\nOlivia Newton-John was born in Cambridge, England, to Welsh-born professor Brinley Newton-John and his wife, Irene Born. Her maternal grandfather, Max Born, was a German-born physicist and Nobel laureate. Newton-John's family moved to Melbourne, Australia, when she was six years old. She grew up in a musical family, with her mother encouraging her to sing and perform from a young age.\n\nCareer\n--------\n\n### Career Beginnings\n\nNewton-John's music career began at the age of 15, when she formed a girl group called The Sol Four with three friends. She later performed on local radio stations and at music venues in Melbourne. In 1965, Newton-John won a talent contest on the popular Australian television show, \"Sing, Sing, Sing,\" which led to her being discovered by a London-based talent scout.\n\n### 1971–1974: Early Success\n\nNewton-John's first single, \"Till You Say You'll Be Mine,\" was released in 1966, but it was not until 1971 that she achieved her first major success with the single \"If Not for You,\" which reached the top 10 in Australia.

The storm, which was fueled by a low-pressure system that developed in the western United States, caused widespread disruptions and hazardous travel conditions across Canada and the United States.\n\n# Meteorological history\n\nThe winter storm began to take shape on December 18, 2022, as a low-pressure system developed over the Rocky Mountains. The system quickly intensified as it moved eastward, driven by a strong jet stream and fueled by moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. As the storm system moved into the Midwest, it underwent a process known as bombogenesis, in which the central pressure of the storm dropped rapidly, leading to a significant increase in wind speed and precipitation.\n\nBy December 20, the storm had spread across much of North America, bringing snowfall, freezing rain, and high winds to a large portion of Canada and the United States. The storm's impact was exacerbated by a cold front that moved into the region, bringing extremely cold temperatures and high winds.\n\n# Preparations\n\nAs the storm approached, governments and emergency management officials across North America took steps to prepare for the expected impact. Travel advisories were issued, and residents were warned to stock up on supplies and prepare for power outages. Many schools and businesses were closed in advance of the storm, and public transportation systems were shut down or reduced in many areas.\n\nIn the United States, the National Weather Service issued a series of winter storm warnings and advisories, while the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) activated its emergency operations center to coordinate the federal response to the storm. In Canada, Environment and Climate Change Canada issued similar warnings and advisories, while provincial and territorial governments activated their emergency management systems.\n\n# Impact\n\nThe December 2022 North American winter storm had a significant impact on the continent, causing widespread disruptions and hazardous travel conditions.\n\n## Deaths\n\nAt least 90 people died as a result of the storm, with the majority of fatalities occurring in the United States. The causes of death included hypothermia, carbon monoxide poisoning, and traffic accidents. In addition, many people were injured, and thousands were left without power or heat.\n\n## Infrastructure\n\nThe storm had a significant impact on infrastructure across North America, with widespread power outages, flight delays and cancellations, and road closures and crashes.\n\n### Flight delays and cancellations\n\nThe storm caused significant disruptions to air travel, with thousands of flights delayed or cancelled across North America. Many airports were shut down or reduced to limited operations, and travelers were stranded in airports or forced to seek alternative transportation.\n\n### Road closures and crashes\n\nThe storm made roads hazardous, with many roads closed or impassable due to snow and ice. Thousands of vehicles were involved in accidents, and many people were stranded in their vehicles.\n\n### Intra-city transit disruptions\n\nPublic transportation systems were disrupted in many cities, with buses and trains cancelled or delayed. In some cities, public transportation was shut down entirely.\n\n### Inter-city train delays and cancellations\n\nTrain travel was also disrupted, with many trains delayed or cancelled. Amtrak, the United States' national passenger railroad, cancelled or delayed many trains, while VIA Rail, Canada's national passenger railroad, also experienced significant disruptions.\n\n### Energy emergencies\n\nThe storm caused energy emergencies in many areas, with widespread power outages and heating system failures. In some areas, residents were forced to seek alternative heat sources, such as fireplaces or portable heaters.\n\n### Power outages\n\nAt least 1.5 million people lost power as a result of the storm, with many areas experiencing extended outages. Utility companies worked to restore power, but in some areas, outages lasted for days.\n\n## Sports\n\nThe storm had a significant impact on sports, with many games and events cancelled or postponed. In the United States, many college and professional sports games were cancelled, while in Canada, several hockey games were postponed.\n\n## Corporate and institutional closures\n\nMany businesses and institutions were closed during the storm, with some remaining closed for extended periods. In the United States, many government offices were closed, while in Canada, many provincial and territorial government offices were also closed.\n\n## Animals\n\nThe storm had a significant impact on animals, with many pets and livestock affected by the cold temperatures and lack of food and water. Many animal shelters were overwhelmed, and some animals were forced to seek alternative shelter.\n\n# Post-storm cold wave\n\nFollowing the storm, a prolonged cold wave affected much of North America, with extremely cold temperatures and high winds.\n\n## Rocky Mountain region\n\nThe Rocky Mountain region was particularly affected, with temperatures plummeting to -40°C (-40°F) in some areas. Many residents were forced to seek alternative heat sources, and some areas experienced extended power outages.\n\n## Central United States\n\nThe central United States was also affected, with temperatures dropping to -30°C (-22°F) in some areas. Many schools and businesses were closed, and some areas experienced power outages.\n\n## Eastern United States\n\nThe eastern United States was affected by the cold wave, with temperatures dropping to -20°C (-4°F) in some areas. Many residents were forced to seek alternative heat sources, and some areas experienced power outages.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of North American winter storms\n* December 2022\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a factual account of the December 2022 North American winter storm.

Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, the bank played a significant role in the growth of the tech industry in Silicon Valley and beyond. However, its remarkable success came to an abrupt end when it collapsed in 2023.\n\n**Foundation and early growth**\n\nSilicon Valley Bank was founded in 1983 by Bill Biggerstaff and Joseph Medici. Initially, the bank focused on providing financial services to technology startups in the San Francisco Bay Area. The bank's founders recognized the potential for growth in the tech industry and capitalized on the opportunity to serve the unique financial needs of startups.\n\nThroughout the 1980s and 1990s, SVB experienced rapid growth as the tech industry expanded. The bank's client base grew to include some of the most prominent tech companies of the time, including Apple, Cisco Systems, and Oracle. SVB's expertise in serving tech startups helped establish it as a trusted partner in the industry.\n\n**Expansion**\n\nIn the early 2000s, SVB began to expand its operations beyond California. The bank opened offices in other major tech hubs, including Boston, New York, and Seattle. This expansion allowed SVB to serve a broader range of clients and further solidified its position as a leader in the tech banking industry.\n\nDuring this period, SVB also began to diversify its services, offering a wider range of financial products and advisory services to its clients. The bank's expansion into new markets and its increased service offerings helped drive growth and establish SVB as a major player in the financial industry.\n\n**Operations in lead-up to collapse**\n\n### Business model\n\nSVB's business model was centered around providing financial services to tech, life science, and private equity clients. The bank's services included traditional banking products, such as deposit accounts and loans, as well as more specialized services, such as venture debt and treasury management.\n\nSVB's focus on serving the tech industry allowed it to develop a deep understanding of the unique financial needs of its clients. The bank's expertise in this area helped it to establish long-term relationships with its clients and drive growth through referrals and word-of-mouth.\n\n### Facilities\n\nSVB maintained a network of offices and branches in the United States and internationally. The bank's headquarters was located in Santa Clara, California, and it had additional offices in major tech hubs, including Boston, New York, and Seattle.\n\nIn addition to its physical locations, SVB also invested heavily in its online banking platform, allowing clients to manage their accounts and access financial services remotely.\n\n### Affiliations and community involvement\n\nSVB was actively involved in the tech community, sponsoring industry events and partnering with organizations that supported entrepreneurship and innovation. The bank's community involvement helped to establish it as a trusted partner in the tech industry and reinforced its commitment to serving the financial needs of its clients.\n\n**Collapse**\n\nIn 2023, Silicon Valley Bank collapsed, marking a sudden and unexpected end to its remarkable success story. The collapse was triggered by a combination of factors, including a decline in the tech industry, increased competition from other financial institutions, and a failure to adapt to changing market conditions.\n\nThe collapse of SVB had significant implications for the tech industry, as the bank had played a critical role in supporting the growth of startups and established companies alike. The bank's failure also raised questions about the stability of the financial system and the role of regulators in preventing such collapses.\n\n**References**\n\n**Works cited**\n\n* **Further reading**\n* **External links**", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Silicon_Valley_Bank\" following this outline:\n\n#Foundation and early growth\n#Expansion\n#Operations in lead-up to collapse\n##Business model\n##Facilities\n##Affiliations and community involvement\n#Collapse\n#References\n##Works cited\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Despite the challenges and limitations of the time, Roman surgeons made significant contributions to the field of surgery, and their work laid the foundation for many modern surgical practices. This article provides an overview of the history, tools, and techniques of surgery in ancient Rome.\n\n# History\n\nSurgery in ancient Rome was heavily influenced by Greek medicine, which had been introduced to Italy through the conquests of Alexander the Great. Many Greek physicians, such as Hippocrates and Galen, wrote extensively on surgical techniques and procedures, and their works were widely studied and emulated by Roman doctors. The Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder, for example, wrote about the use of surgical instruments and techniques in his book \"Naturalis Historia\".\n\nRoman surgeons also developed their own unique techniques and tools, often in response to the specific needs of the Roman army and the demands of military medicine. The Roman physician Dioscorides, for example, wrote about the use of surgical instruments in his book \"De Materia Medica\", and the Roman surgeon Galen developed a number of innovative surgical techniques, including the use of ligatures to control bleeding.\n\nDespite the advances made by Roman surgeons, the field of surgery was not without its challenges. Many surgical procedures were extremely painful and often resulted in infection or death. The Roman physician Celsus, for example, wrote about the dangers of surgery and the need for great care and caution when performing operations.\n\n# Tools\n\nRoman surgeons used a wide variety of tools and instruments, many of which were adapted from Greek and Egyptian designs. Some of the most common tools used by Roman surgeons include:\n\n## Cupping vessels\n\nCupping vessels were small, cup-shaped instruments used to create suction on the skin. They were often used to treat a variety of conditions, including headaches and fever.\n\n## Chisels and raspatories\n\nChisels and raspatories were used to cut and shape bone, as well as to remove damaged or diseased tissue.\n\n## Drills and levers\n\nDrills and levers were used to make holes in bone and to pry apart bones and other tissues.\n\n## Saws and trephines\n\nSaws and trephines were used to cut through bone and to remove sections of skull or other bones.\n\n## Forceps\n\nForceps were used to grasp and manipulate tissues and organs.\n\n## Probes and curettes\n\nProbes and curettes were used to explore and clean wounds, as well as to remove damaged or diseased tissue.\n\n## Scalpels\n\nScalpels were used to make incisions and to cut through tissue.\n\n## Specula\n\nSpecula were used to dilate and examine the vagina and anus.\n\n## Spoon of Diocles\n\nThe Spoon of Diocles was a specialized instrument used to remove the placenta after childbirth.\n\n## Catheters\n\nCatheters were used to insert fluids into the body, as well as to drain fluids from the body.\n\n## Strigils\n\nStrigils were used to scrape and clean the skin, often in conjunction with other treatments.\n\n## Knives and needles\n\nKnives and needles were used for a variety of purposes, including suturing and ligating wounds.\n\n## Hooks\n\nHooks were used to grasp and manipulate tissues and organs.\n\n## Other tools\n\nRoman surgeons also used a variety of other tools, including retractors, dilators, and compresses.\n\n# Techniques\n\nRoman surgeons developed a wide range of techniques and procedures, many of which were adapted from Greek and Egyptian medicine. Some of the most common techniques used by Roman surgeons include:\n\n## Abortion\n\nAbortion was a common procedure in ancient Rome, often performed using herbs and other medications to induce miscarriage.\n\n## Amputations and dissections\n\nAmputations and dissections were often performed to treat a variety of conditions, including injuries and infections.\n\n## Bloodletting\n\nBloodletting was a common treatment for a variety of conditions, including fever and headache.\n\n## Caesarean section\n\nCaesarean section was a rare but sometimes necessary procedure, often performed to save the life of the mother or child.\n\n## Cataract surgery\n\nCataract surgery was a common procedure, often performed using a specialized instrument called a \"couching needle\".\n\n## Cosmetic surgery\n\nCosmetic surgery was a growing field in ancient Rome, with procedures such as nose reconstruction and breast augmentation becoming increasingly popular.\n\n## Hernia treatment\n\nHernia treatment often involved surgical repair, as well as the use of trusses and other supportive devices.\n\n## Lithotomy\n\nLithotomy was a procedure used to remove kidney stones, often performed using a specialized instrument called a \"lithotomy scoop\".\n\n## Neurosurgery\n\nNeurosurgery was a growing field in ancient Rome, with procedures such as trephining and craniotomy becoming increasingly common.\n\n## Sutures, ligatures, and contractions\n\nSutures, ligatures, and contractions were used to close wounds and promote healing.\n\n## Tonsillectomies and mastectomies\n\nTonsillectomies and mastectomies were sometimes performed to treat a variety of conditions, including infections and tumors.\n\n## Tooth extraction\n\nTooth extraction was a common procedure, often performed using specialized instruments such as forceps and elevators.\n\n## Other techniques\n\nRoman surgeons also developed a variety of other techniques, including the use of herbal remedies and other alternative treatments.\n\n# References\n\n## Bibliography\n\n* Celsus, Aulus Cornelius. \"De Medicina\".\n* Dioscorides, Pedanius. \"De Materia Medica\".\n* Galen, Claudius. \"On the Natural Faculties\".\n* Hippocrates. \"On the Nature of Man\".\n* Pliny the Elder. \"Naturalis Historia\".\n\n# External links\n\n* The Roman Medicine Timeline\n* The History of Surgery in Ancient Rome\n* The Tools of the Roman Surgeon", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Surgery_in_ancient_Rome\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n#Tools\n##Cupping vessels\n##Chisels and raspatories\n##Drills and levers\n##Saws and trephines\n##Forceps\n##Probes and curettes\n##Scalpels\n##Specula\n##Spoon of Diocles\n##Catheters\n##Strigils\n##Knives and needles\n##Hooks\n##Other tools\n#Techniques\n##Abortion\n##Amputations and dissections\n##Bloodletting\n##Caesarean section\n##Cataract surgery\n##Cosmetic surgery\n##Hernia treatment\n##Lithotomy\n##Neurosurgery\n##Sutures, ligatures, and contractions\n##Tonsillectomies and mastectomies\n##Tooth extraction\n##Other techniques\n#References\n##Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Iran also qualified for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, where they drew with Nigeria and Argentina but lost to Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n## Late 2010s\n\nIran's football continued to improve in the late 2010s, and the team qualified for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, where they drew with Portugal and Morocco but lost to Spain. Iran also won the 2018 CAFA Nations Cup and the 2019 WAFF Championship.\n\n## Early 2020s\n\nIn 2020, the Iranian Football Federation appointed Dragan Skočić as the new head coach. The team qualified for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, where they lost to England and the United States but drew with Wales.\n\n# Team image\n\n## Nicknames\n\nThe Iran national football team is nicknamed

African Greeks have played a significant role in shaping the history and culture of Africa, particularly in the regions of Egypt, Ethiopia, Libya, and Nubia. This article explores the history and legacy of African Greeks in these regions.\n\n# Ancient Egypt\n\nAncient Egypt was one of the earliest and most significant centers of Greek presence in Africa. The Greeks established several colonies and settlements in Egypt, which became an important hub for trade, culture, and learning.\n\n## First historical colonies\n\nThe first recorded Greek presence in Egypt dates back to the 7th century BC, when Greek traders and mercenaries arrived in the Nile Delta. These early Greek settlers established colonies in the cities of Naucratis and Thonis-Heraklion, which became major centers of Greek culture and trade. The Greeks brought with them their language, customs, and traditions, which had a profound impact on the local Egyptian population.\n\n## Hellenistic times\n\n### Rule of Alexander the Great (332–323 BC)\n\nIn 332 BC, Alexander the Great conquered Egypt, marking the beginning of the Hellenistic period in the region. Alexander's conquest brought about significant cultural and linguistic changes, as Greek became the language of the ruling elite. The Ptolemaic dynasty, which ruled Egypt after Alexander's death, was of Greek origin, and they established a distinctively Greek culture in the region.\n\n### The Ptolemaic Empire (323–30 BC)\n\nThe Ptolemaic Empire was a Greek dynasty that ruled Egypt from 323 to 30 BC. During this period, the Greeks established a number of cities, including Alexandria, which became a major center of learning and culture. The city was home to the famous Library of Alexandria, which was a repository of knowledge and learning. The Ptolemies also established a number of other cities, including Ptolemais and Berenice, which became important centers of Greek culture.\n\n## Roman and Byzantine Egypt\n\n### Coptic Greeks\n\nAfter the Roman conquest of Egypt in 30 BC, the Greek population in Egypt began to decline. However, the Coptic Christian community, which emerged in the 1st century AD, continued to preserve Greek culture and traditions. The Copts were a distinct ethnic group that emerged in Egypt during the Roman period, and they maintained a strong sense of Greek identity. The Coptic language, which is still spoken today, is a derivative of ancient Greek.\n\n# Ancient Ethiopia\n\nAncient Ethiopia was another region in Africa where the Greeks established a significant presence.\n\n## Axumites of Ethiopia\n\nThe Axumite Empire, which existed from the 1st to the 8th centuries AD, was a major power in ancient Ethiopia. The Axumites had significant trade and cultural contacts with the Greeks, and they adopted many Greek customs and traditions. The Axumite capital, Axum, was an important center of Greek culture, and it was home to a number of Greek artisans and traders.\n\n## Abyssinian Greeks\n\nThe Abyssinian Greeks were a distinct ethnic group that emerged in Ethiopia during the medieval period. They were descended from Greek traders and settlers who had arrived in Ethiopia during the Axumite period. The Abyssinian Greeks maintained a strong sense of Greek identity and culture, and they played an important role in the development of Ethiopian art and architecture.\n\n# Ancient Libya\n\nAncient Libya was another region in Africa where the Greeks established a significant presence.\n\n## Libyan Greeks of Cyrenaica\n\nThe Libyan Greeks of Cyrenaica were a distinct ethnic group that emerged in eastern Libya during the 7th century BC. They were descended from Greek colonizers who had established the city of Cyrene, which became a major center of Greek culture and trade. The Libyan Greeks of Cyrenaica maintained a strong sense of Greek identity and culture, and they played an important role in the development of Libyan art and architecture.\n\n## Libyan Greek culture\n\nLibyan Greek culture was a unique blend of Greek and African traditions. The Libyan Greeks adopted many African customs and practices, while maintaining a strong sense of Greek identity. The city of Cyrene was an important center of Libyan Greek culture, and it was home to a number of Greek artisans and traders.\n\n# Ancient Nubia\n\nAncient Nubia was another region in Africa where the Greeks established a significant presence.\n\n## Axumite subjugation of Nubia\n\nIn the 3rd century AD, the Axumite Empire conquered Nubia, which led to the establishment of a number of Greek settlements in the region. The Axumites brought with them their Greek culture and traditions, which had a profound impact on the local Nubian population.\n\n## Nubian Greeks\n\nThe Nubian Greeks were a distinct ethnic group that emerged in Nubia during the medieval period. They were descended from Greek traders and settlers who had arrived in Nubia during the Axumite period. The Nubian Greeks maintained a strong sense of Greek identity and culture, and they played an important role in the development of Nubian art and architecture.\n\nIn conclusion, the presence of Greeks in Africa dates back to ancient times, with various colonies and settlements established throughout the continent. African Greeks have played a significant role in shaping the history and culture of Africa, particularly in the regions of Egypt, Ethiopia, Libya, and Nubia. The legacy of African Greeks continues to be felt today, with many African countries continuing to celebrate their Greek heritage.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"African_Greeks\" following this outline:\n\n#Ancient Egypt\n##First historical colonies\n##Hellenistic times\n###Rule of Alexander the Great (332–323 BC)\n###The Ptolemaic Empire (323–30 BC)\n##Roman and Byzantine Egypt\n###Coptic Greeks\n#Ancient Ethiopia\n##Axumites of Ethiopia\n##Abyssinian Greeks\n#Ancient Libya\n##Libyan Greeks of Cyrenaica\n##Libyan Greek culture\n#Ancient Nubia\n##Axumite subjugation of Nubia\n##Nubian Greeks\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
