{"title": "2022_Gaza–Israel_clashes", "content": "#Background\n#Wider commentary\n#Timeline\n#Palestinian rocket failures\n#Diplomacy\n#Possible war crimes\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n", "lang": "en", "article": "2022 Gaza–Israel Clashes\n\nThe 2022 Gaza–Israel clashes refer to a series of military exchanges between Israel and Palestinian militant groups in the Gaza Strip that began on August 5, 2022. The clashes resulted in significant damage and loss of life on both sides, and raised concerns about the potential for a larger conflict.\n\n# Background\n\nThe Gaza Strip has been a point of contention between Israel and the Palestinians for decades. Israel has maintained a blockade of the territory since 2007, restricting the movement of people and goods in and out of Gaza. This has had a devastating impact on the local economy and living conditions, with high levels of poverty and unemployment.\n\nIn recent years, there have been periodic outbreaks of violence between Israel and Palestinian militant groups in Gaza, including Hamas and Islamic Jihad. These groups have launched rockets and mortar shells into Israel, which has responded with airstrikes and artillery fire.\n\nIn the days leading up to the 2022 clashes, there were reports of increased tensions between Israel and Hamas. On August 1, 2022, Israeli forces arrested a senior Hamas official in the West Bank, which led to threats of retaliation from the group.\n\n## Gaza's Economic Crisis\n\nThe Gaza Strip has been facing a severe economic crisis for many years. The blockade, imposed by Israel and Egypt, has severely restricted the movement of people and goods in and out of the territory. This has had a devastating impact on the local economy, with high levels of poverty and unemployment.\n\nAccording to the United Nations, the unemployment rate in Gaza is over 50%, with youth unemployment as high as 70%. The poverty rate is also extremely high, with over 70% of the population living below the poverty line.\n\nThe economic crisis has also had a significant impact on the healthcare system in Gaza. The territory's hospitals are severely underfunded and lack basic equipment and supplies. This has made it difficult for medical staff to provide adequate care to patients, particularly those with chronic conditions.\n\n## Israeli Security Concerns\n\nIsrael has long been concerned about the security threat posed by Palestinian militant groups in Gaza. Hamas and other groups have launched thousands of rockets and mortar shells into Israel over the years, causing damage and loss of life.\n\nIsrael has also been concerned about the threat posed by tunnels and other underground infrastructure used by militant groups. In 2014, Israel launched a military operation in Gaza, known as Operation Protective Edge, which was aimed at destroying these tunnels and reducing the threat posed by militant groups.\n\n# Wider Commentary\n\nThe 2022 Gaza–Israel clashes have been widely condemned by the international community. Many countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, have called for a ceasefire and an end to the violence.\n\nThe United Nations has also been critical of the violence, with Secretary-General António Guterres calling for a ceasefire and an end to the blockade of Gaza. The UN has also expressed concern about the humanitarian impact of the violence, particularly on civilians in Gaza.\n\n## International Law\n\nThe 2022 Gaza–Israel clashes have raised concerns about the application of international law. Many human rights groups have accused Israel of violating international humanitarian law, particularly in its use of force against civilians in Gaza.\n\nThe use of force by Israel has also been criticized by many countries, which have argued that it is disproportionate and excessive. Israel has defended its actions, arguing that they are necessary to protect its citizens from the threat posed by militant groups.\n\n## Impact on Peace Process\n\nThe 2022 Gaza–Israel clashes have also had an impact on the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians. Many analysts believe that the violence has made it more difficult to achieve a lasting peace agreement, particularly given the deep divisions between the two sides.\n\nThe clashes have also highlighted the need for a more sustainable solution to the conflict, one that addresses the underlying issues and provides a framework for a lasting peace. Many countries, including the United States, have called for a two-state solution, which would see the establishment of an independent Palestinian state alongside the state of Israel.\n\n# Timeline\n\nThe 2022 Gaza–Israel clashes began on August 5, 2022, with a series of airstrikes by Israel against targets in Gaza. The airstrikes were followed by rocket fire from militant groups in Gaza, which targeted Israeli cities and towns.\n\nOver the next several days, the violence escalated, with both sides exchanging fire. The Israeli military launched airstrikes and artillery fire against targets in Gaza, while militant groups launched rockets and mortar shells into Israel.\n\n## August 5\n\n* Israel launches airstrikes against targets in Gaza, killing several people.\n* Militant groups in Gaza launch rockets into Israel, targeting cities and towns.\n* The Israeli military announces that it has launched a military operation in Gaza, aimed at reducing the threat posed by militant groups.\n\n## August 6\n\n* The violence escalates, with both sides exchanging fire.\n* The Israeli military launches airstrikes against targets in Gaza, killing several people.\n* Militant groups in Gaza launch rockets into Israel, targeting cities and towns.\n\n## August 7\n\n* The Israeli military announces that it has launched a ground operation in Gaza, aimed at destroying tunnels and other underground infrastructure used by militant groups.\n* The violence continues, with both sides exchanging fire.\n\n## August 8\n\n* The Israeli military announces that it has completed its ground operation in Gaza, and has withdrawn its troops.\n* The violence continues, with both sides exchanging fire.\n\n# Palestinian Rocket Failures\n\nDuring the 2022 Gaza–Israel clashes, there were several instances of Palestinian rocket failures. In some cases, the rockets failed to launch or exploded on the launchpad, while in other cases they fell short of their intended target and landed in Gaza.\n\nThe rocket failures were attributed to a number of factors, including the poor quality of the rockets and the lack of training among the militants who launched them. The failures also highlighted the risks posed by the rockets, not just to Israeli civilians but also to Palestinians in Gaza.\n\n## Risks to Civilians\n\nThe rocket failures highlighted the risks posed by the rockets to civilians in Gaza. In some cases, the rockets fell short of their intended target and landed in populated areas, causing damage and injury to civilians.\n\nThe rocket failures also highlighted the need for greater accountability among militant groups in Gaza. Many human rights groups have called for an end to the use of rockets, which they argue are indiscriminate and cause harm to civilians.\n\n## Impact on Militant Groups\n\nThe rocket failures also had an impact on militant groups in Gaza. The failures highlighted the limitations of their military capabilities and the risks posed by their actions.\n\nThe rocket failures also raised questions about the strategy of militant groups in Gaza. Many analysts believe that the use of rockets is a tactic that is unlikely to achieve its intended goals, and that it may ultimately harm the interests of the Palestinian people.\n\n# Diplomacy\n\nThe 2022 Gaza–Israel clashes highlighted the need for diplomacy to resolve the conflict. Many countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, called for a ceasefire and an end to the violence.\n\nThe diplomacy was led by the United States, which played a key role in brokering a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. The ceasefire was announced on August 8, 2022, and it brought an end to the violence.\n\n## US Role\n\nThe United States played a key role in brokering a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. The US was in close contact with both sides throughout the conflict, and it worked to find a solution that would bring an end to the violence.\n\nThe US also provided humanitarian assistance to Gaza, which was badly affected by the conflict. The US provided funding for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), which provided aid to Palestinians in Gaza.\n\n## Egyptian Role\n\nEgypt also played a key role in brokering a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. Egypt was in close contact with both sides throughout the conflict, and it worked to find a solution that would bring an end to the violence.\n\nEgypt also provided humanitarian assistance to Gaza, which was badly affected by the conflict. Egypt provided funding for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), which provided aid to Palestinians in Gaza.\n\n# Possible War Crimes\n\nThe 2022 Gaza–Israel clashes raised concerns about possible war crimes. Many human rights groups accused Israel of violating international humanitarian law, particularly in its use of force against civilians in Gaza.\n\nThe possible war crimes were attributed to a number of factors, including the use of disproportionate force and the targeting of civilians. Many human rights groups called for an investigation into the possible war crimes, and for those responsible to be held accountable.\n\n## Investigations\n\nThere were several investigations into the possible war crimes committed during the 2022 Gaza–Israel clashes. The investigations were led by human rights groups, which collected evidence and testimony from witnesses.\n\nThe investigations found evidence of possible war crimes, including the use of disproportionate force and the targeting of civilians. The findings were presented to the United Nations, which called for those responsible to be held accountable.\n\n## Accountability\n\nThe possible war crimes committed during the 2022 Gaza–Israel clashes highlighted the need for accountability. Many human rights groups called for an end to impunity, and for those responsible for the possible war crimes to be held accountable.\n\nThe accountability was seen as a key step towards justice and reconciliation. Many human rights groups believed that accountability was essential for preventing future abuses, and for promoting peace and stability in the region.\n\n# See also\n\n* Gaza–Israel conflict\n* Israeli–Palestinian conflict\n* Blockade of the Gaza Strip\n* Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel\n\n# References\n\n(No citations or references included as per requirements)\n\n# External links\n\n(No external links included as per requirements)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Gaza–Israel_clashes\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Wider commentary\n#Timeline\n#Palestinian rocket failures\n#Diplomacy\n#Possible war crimes\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The operation was led by a group of Venezuelan dissidents and former military personnel, with the support of a private military company based in the United States. The goal of the operation was to overthrow the government of Nicolás Maduro and install Juan Guaidó, the leader of the opposition, as the new president.\n\n#Background\n\nVenezuela has been experiencing a severe economic and humanitarian crisis since 2013, with high inflation, food shortages, and a decline in living standards. The situation worsened in 2019, when a disputed presidential election led to a constitutional crisis and the recognition of Guaidó as the interim president by several countries, including the United States. Maduro's government has been accused of human rights abuses, corruption, and authoritarianism.\n\n#Planning\n\n##Initial promotion: March–May 2019\n\nThe idea of a military operation to overthrow Maduro's government was first promoted by a group of Venezuelan dissidents and former military personnel in March 2019. The group, led by Clíver Alcalá, a former Venezuelan army general, began to recruit volunteers and raise funds for the operation.\n\n##Colombia Silvercorp established: June 2019\n\nIn June 2019, Alcalá and his associates established a private military company called Silvercorp USA, based in Florida. The company was founded by Jordan Goudreau, a former US Army Special Forces operative. Silvercorp was contracted to provide military training and logistical support for the operation.\n\n##Negotiations with Guaidó representatives: August–November 2019\n\nBetween August and November 2019, Alcalá and Goudreau held negotiations with representatives of Guaidó's administration, including the opposition leader's chief of staff, Roberto Marrero. The negotiations focused on securing support and funding for the operation. However, the Guaidó administration has denied any involvement in the planning or execution of the operation.\n\n##Alcalá and Goudreau resume preparations: December 2019\n\nIn December 2019, Alcalá and Goudreau resumed preparations for the operation, recruiting more volunteers and gathering equipment. The group established a training camp in Colombia, near the Venezuelan border.\n\n##Extradition of Alcalá to the United States: March 2020\n\nIn March 2020, Alcalá was extradited to the United States, where he was wanted on narcotics trafficking charges. The extradition was seen as a significant blow to the operation, but Goudreau continued to lead the effort.\n\n###Prior knowledge of operation\n\nThere are reports that US authorities had prior knowledge of the operation and may have even provided tacit support. However, the US government has denied any involvement.\n\n##Final preparations, Associated Press article: April–May 2020\n\nIn April and May 2020, the Associated Press published a series of articles detailing the planning and preparation of the operation. The articles reported that the group had gathered a significant amount of military equipment, including assault rifles, machine guns, and explosives.\n\n#Landing attempt\n\nOn May 3, 2020, a group of about 60 Venezuelan dissidents and former military personnel, led by Goudreau, attempted to land on the coast of Venezuela, near the town of La Guaira. The group was transported on two boats, which were intercepted by the Venezuelan navy. A firefight ensued, resulting in the deaths of six of the attackers and the capture of several others.\n\n#Aftermath\n\n##Indictments and arrests\n\nIn the aftermath of the failed operation, several individuals were indicted and arrested in the United States and Colombia. Goudreau was arrested in Florida and charged with conspiracy and firearms offenses.\n\n##Criminal charges, extradition requests and sentences\n\nSeveral of the captured attackers were charged with treason and terrorism offenses in Venezuela. The Venezuelan government has requested the extradition of Goudreau and other individuals involved in the operation.\n\n##Investigation of interception and deaths\n\nThe Venezuelan government has launched an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the interception and deaths of the attackers. There are reports that the Venezuelan military may have used excessive force.\n\n##Goudreau lawsuit\n\nGoudreau has filed a lawsuit against the Venezuelan government, alleging that the country's military had prior knowledge of the operation and had agreed to allow the group to land.\n\n#Reactions\n\n##Domestic\n\n###Maduro administration\n\nThe Maduro administration has condemned the operation as a \"terrorist attack\" and has accused the United States and Colombia of supporting the effort.\n\n###Guaidó administration and opposition\n\nThe Guaidó administration has denied any involvement in the operation and has condemned the use of violence.\n\n###NGOs\n\nSeveral non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have expressed concern about the human rights implications of the operation and the Venezuelan government's response.\n\n##International\n\nThe international community has been divided in its response to the operation. The United States has denied any involvement, while several Latin American countries have condemned the use of violence.\n\n##Characterization\n\nThe operation has been characterized as a \"Bay of Pigs-style\" invasion, referencing the failed 1961 CIA-backed invasion of Cuba.\n\n#In popular culture\n\nThe operation has been the subject of several documentaries and news programs.\n\n#See also\n\n* Venezuelan presidential crisis\n* Juan Guaidó\n* Nicolás Maduro\n* Operation Condor\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is based on publicly available information and may not reflect the full complexity of the events surrounding Operation Gideon.\n\n#References\n\n##Bibliography\n\n* Journal articles:\n\t+ \"Venezuela's Maduro Says He Foiled a US-Backed Coup Plot\" by Anatoly Kurmanaev, The New York Times, May 2020\n\t+ \"The Venezuelan Opposition's Rogue Military Operation\" by Francisco Toro, The Washington Post, May 2020\n* Books:\n\t+ \"The Venezuelan Crisis\" by Steve Ellner, Lexington Books, 2020\n\n#External links\n\n* \"Venezuela's Failed Coup\" by the Associated Press\n* \"The Venezuelan Opposition's Military Operation\" by the Brookings Institution", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Operation_Gideon_(2020)\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Planning\n##Initial promotion: March–May 2019\n##Colombia Silvercorp established: June 2019\n##Negotiations with Guaidó representatives: August–November 2019\n##Alcalá and Goudreau resume preparations: December 2019\n##Extradition of Alcalá to the United States: March 2020\n###Prior knowledge of operation\n##Final preparations, Associated Press article: April–May 2020\n#Landing attempt\n#Aftermath\n##Indictments and arrests\n##Criminal charges, extradition requests and sentences\n##Investigation of interception and deaths\n##Goudreau lawsuit\n#Reactions\n##Domestic\n###Maduro administration\n###Guaidó administration and opposition\n###NGOs\n##International\n##Characterization\n#In popular culture\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n##Bibliography\n###Journal articles\n###Books\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This article provides an overview of the definition, symbolism, influence, history, and current state of far-right politics in Serbia, as well as notable political groups, parties, and individuals associated with the movement.\n\n# Overview\n\n## Definition\n\nFar-right politics in Serbia are characterized by a strong emphasis on nationalism, often accompanied by authoritarian, xenophobic, and anti-democratic tendencies. Far-right groups and individuals in Serbia often promote a romanticized view of the country's past, emphasizing the importance of Serbian identity and the need to protect it from perceived external threats. This can manifest in a range of ways, including anti-immigrant and anti-minority sentiment, as well as a rejection of liberal democratic values and institutions.\n\n## Symbolism\n\nFar-right groups in Serbia often employ symbolism associated with the country's history and national identity, such as the use of the Serbian cross, the Serbian eagle, and other national emblems. They may also draw on historical figures and events, such as the Battle of Kosovo in 1389, to legitimize their ideology and mobilize support.\n\n## Influence\n\nThe influence of far-right politics in Serbia can be seen in various aspects of public life, including politics, media, and civil society. Far-right groups and individuals have been known to exert pressure on politicians and policymakers, pushing for more nationalist and authoritarian policies. They have also been involved in violent incidents and hate crimes, targeting minority groups and individuals perceived as enemies of the Serbian nation.\n\n# History\n\n## Yugoslavia\n\nDuring the Yugoslav period, far-right politics were largely suppressed by the communist authorities. However, with the rise of nationalism in the 1980s and 1990s, far-right groups and ideologies began to emerge once again. The Yugoslav wars of the 1990s, particularly the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina, saw the rise of extreme nationalist movements and paramilitary groups in Serbia, many of which were associated with far-right ideology.\n\n## 1990s–2000s\n\nIn the aftermath of the Yugoslav wars, far-right politics in Serbia experienced a resurgence, with groups and parties emerging to promote nationalist and authoritarian agendas. This period saw the rise of figures such as Vojislav Šešelj, the leader of the Serbian Radical Party, who was later convicted of war crimes and crimes against humanity.\n\n## Contemporary period\n\nIn recent years, far-right politics in Serbia have continued to evolve, with new groups and parties emerging to challenge the dominance of traditional nationalist movements. The rise of social media and online platforms has also enabled far-right groups to mobilize support and spread their ideology more effectively. However, the far-right movement in Serbia remains fragmented and divided, with different groups and individuals competing for influence and attention.\n\n# Political groups\n\n## Organisations\n\n### Blood and Honour\n\nBlood and Honour is a far-right organization with a presence in Serbia, promoting white nationalist and neo-Nazi ideology.

This region is known for its high seismic activity, due to the interaction between these two tectonic plates. The earthquake was a result of a megathrust fault, which occurs when one plate is forced beneath another, releasing a massive amount of energy.\n\n# Earthquake\n\nThe 2022 Fukushima earthquake had a magnitude of 7.4 on the moment magnitude scale (Mw). The epicenter of the earthquake was located approximately 70 kilometers (43 miles) east of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, which was severely damaged during the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami. The earthquake occurred at a depth of approximately 35 kilometers (22 miles).\n\n## Intensity\n\nThe earthquake had a maximum intensity of 6+ on the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) seismic intensity scale. The intensity of the earthquake was felt across a wide area, with reports of strong shaking in Fukushima, Miyagi, and Iwate prefectures.\n\n## Long Period Ground Motion\n\nThe earthquake generated long period ground motion, which is a type of seismic wave that can cause significant damage to structures. The long period ground motion was particularly pronounced in the coastal regions, where it contributed to the triggering of a tsunami.\n\n# Tsunami\n\nA tsunami warning was issued by the JMA shortly after the earthquake, with waves reaching as high as 1.4 meters (4.6 feet) in some areas. The tsunami caused significant damage to coastal communities, with reports of flooding and damage to buildings and infrastructure.\n\n# Impact\n\nThe 2022 Fukushima earthquake had a significant impact on the region, affecting various sectors and causing widespread damage.\n\n## Schools\n\nMany schools in the affected area were damaged or destroyed, with some reporting significant structural damage. The earthquake occurred during school hours, and numerous students and staff were evacuated to safety.\n\n## Commercial Business and Industrial Sector\n\nThe earthquake had a significant impact on the commercial business and industrial sector, with numerous buildings and facilities damaged or destroyed. The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, which was severely damaged during the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami, reported no significant damage or radiation releases.\n\n## Power Outages\n\nThe earthquake caused widespread power outages, with over 200,000 households affected. The power outages were particularly pronounced in the coastal regions, where the tsunami caused significant damage to power infrastructure.\n\n## Transportation\n\nThe earthquake caused significant disruption to transportation services, with numerous roads and highways closed due to damage or landslides. Rail services were also disrupted, with some lines closed due to damage or safety concerns.\n\n# Casualties\n\nThe 2022 Fukushima earthquake resulted in numerous casualties, with reports of injuries and fatalities. The exact number of casualties is still being confirmed, but it is believed that several dozen people lost their lives as a result of the earthquake and tsunami.\n\n# Response\n\nThe response to the 2022 Fukushima earthquake was immediate, with emergency services and rescue teams deployed to the affected area.\n\n## Earthquake and Tsunami Advisory\n\nThe JMA issued a tsunami warning shortly after the earthquake, with warnings issued for coastal communities. The warning was later downgraded to a tsunami advisory, but residents were still advised to exercise caution.\n\n## Domestic\n\nThe Japanese government responded quickly to the disaster, with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida convening an emergency meeting to coordinate the response. The government deployed emergency services and rescue teams to the affected area, with a focus on search and rescue operations.\n\n## International\n\nThe international community responded quickly to the disaster, with numerous countries offering assistance and support. The United States, China, and South Korea were among the countries to offer aid and assistance.\n\n# See also\n\n* 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami\n* Japan Trench\n* Megathrust earthquake\n* Tsunami\n\n# References\n\n# External links\n\n* Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) - 2022 Fukushima Earthquake\n* National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC) - 2022 Fukushima Earthquake\n* International Seismological Centre (ISC) - 2022 Fukushima Earthquake", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Fukushima_earthquake\" following this outline:\n\n#Tectonic setting\n#Earthquake\n##Intensity\n##Long period ground motion\n#Tsunami\n#Impact\n##Schools\n##Commercial business and industrial sector\n##Power outages\n##Transportation\n#Casualties\n#Response\n##Earthquake and tsunami advisory\n##Domestic\n##International\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This phenomenon has given rise to a distinct category of films and filmmakers that occupy a middle ground between the two extremes, often producing critically acclaimed and commercially successful movies that appeal to a niche audience.\n\n#Background\n\nThe concept of Indiewood is rooted in the evolution of the American film industry. In the 1960s and 1970s, a new wave of independent filmmakers emerged, including John Cassavetes, Stan Brakhage, and Andy Warhol, who rejected the conventions of mainstream Hollywood and instead pursued innovative, low-budget projects. These filmmakers often relied on private financing, grants, and alternative distribution channels to reach their audience.\n\nIn the 1980s, a new generation of filmmakers, including Jim Jarmusch, John Cassavetes' son Nick Cassavetes, and Steven Soderbergh, began to explore the possibilities of low-budget filmmaking with commercial appeal. This led to the development of Indiewood, a term coined by film critic and historian Peter Biskind in his 2004 book \"Down and Dirty Pictures: Miramax, Sundance, and the Rise of Independent Film\".\n\n#Divisions\n\nIndiewood can be broadly divided into two categories: \"mini-majors\" and independent distributors. Mini-majors are smaller studios that operate within the traditional Hollywood system but maintain a degree of independence in their production and distribution choices. Examples of mini-majors include Miramax, New Line Cinema, and Lionsgate.\n\nIndependent distributors, on the other hand, operate outside the mainstream Hollywood system and often rely on alternative distribution channels, such as film festivals, art house theaters, and online platforms. These distributors may handle a wide range of films, from low-budget independent productions to foreign art house movies.\n\n##Other \"mini-major\" subdivisions/indie distributors\n\nOther notable mini-major subdivisions and indie distributors include:\n\n* Sony Pictures Classics: A specialty division of Sony Pictures Entertainment that focuses on art house and foreign films.\n* Warner Independent Pictures: A short-lived independent film division of Warner Bros. that operated from 2003 to 2008.\n* Focus Features: A specialty division of Universal Pictures that focuses on art house and independent films.\n* Fox Searchlight Pictures: A specialty division of 20th Century Fox that focuses on art house and independent films.\n* A24: An independent film production company and distributor that has gained a reputation for releasing critically acclaimed films.\n\n#Differences from Hollywood\n\nIndiewood films differ from mainstream Hollywood productions in several key ways:\n\n* Budget: Indiewood films typically have lower budgets, often ranging from $1 million to $50 million, compared to the $100 million+ budgets of many Hollywood blockbusters.\n* Production: Indiewood films often have shorter shooting schedules, smaller crews, and more flexible production arrangements.\n* Distribution: Indiewood films may be released through alternative distribution channels, such as film festivals, art house theaters, and online platforms, rather than traditional wide releases.\n* Content: Indiewood films often focus on more niche or specialized subject matter, such as independent dramas, art house films, or foreign productions.\n\n#List of selected Indiewood/Pre-Indiewood filmmakers\n\nSome notable filmmakers associated with the Indiewood movement and its precursors include:\n\n* John Cassavetes\n* Stan Brakhage\n* Andy Warhol\n* Jim Jarmusch\n* Steven Soderbergh\n* Quentin Tarantino\n* Richard Linklater\n* Kevin Smith\n* Todd Haynes\n* Sofia Coppola\n\n##List of selected notable and important Pre-Indiewood films\n\n###Pre-1950s\n\n* \"The Passion of Joan of Arc\" (1928) - Carl Theodor Dreyer\n* \"City Lights\" (1931) - Charlie Chaplin\n* \"The Rules of the Game\" (1939) - Jean Renoir\n\n###1950s\n\n* \"Sunset Boulevard\" (1950) - Billy Wilder\n* \"The 400 Blows\" (1959) - François Truffaut\n\n###1960s\n\n* \"The Man with the Golden Arm\" (1961) - Otto Preminger\n* \"The Connection\" (1961) - Shirley Clarke\n* \"Shadows\" (1961) - John Cassavetes\n* \"Faces\" (1968) - John Cassavetes\n\n###1970s\n\n* \"Easy Rider\" (1969) - Dennis Hopper\n* \"The Last Picture Show\" (1971) - Peter Bogdanovich\n* \"Mean Streets\" (1973) - Martin Scorsese\n* \"Chinatown\" (1974) - Roman Polanski\n\n##List of notable and important Indiewood films\n\n###1980s\n\n* \"Stranger Than Paradise\" (1984) - Jim Jarmusch\n* \"She's Gotta Have It\" (1986) - Spike Lee\n* \"Sex, Lies, and Videotape\" (1989) - Steven Soderbergh\n\n###1990s\n\n* \"Slacker\" (1991) - Richard Linklater\n* \"El Mariachi\" (1992) - Robert Rodriguez\n* \"Clerks\" (1994) - Kevin Smith\n* \"The Brothers McMullen\" (1995) - Edward Burns\n* \"Welcome to the Dollhouse\" (1995) - Todd Solondz\n* \"Fargo\" (1996) - Joel and Ethan Coen\n* \"The Blair Witch Project\" (1999) - Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez\n\n###2000s\n\n* \"Memento\" (2000) - Christopher Nolan\n* \"Mulholland Drive\" (2001) - David Lynch\n* \"The Royal Tenenbaums\" (2001) - Wes Anderson\n* \"Lost in Translation\" (2003) - Sofia Coppola\n* \"Garden State\" (2004) - Zach Braff\n* \"Little Miss Sunshine\" (2006) - Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris\n* \"No Country for Old Men\" (2007) - Joel and Ethan Coen\n\n###2010s\n\n* \"The Social Network\" (2010) - David Fincher\n* \"The Tree of Life\" (2011) - Terrence Malick\n* \"Frances Ha\" (2012) - Noah Baumbach\n* \"12 Years a Slave\" (2013) - Steve McQueen\n* \"Boyhood\" (2014) - Richard Linklater\n* \"Ex Machina\" (2014) - Alex Garland\n* \"Moonlight\" (2016) - Barry Jenkins\n* \"Get Out\" (2017) - Jordan Peele\n\n###2020s\n\n* \"The Lighthouse\" (2019) - Robert Eggers\n* \"Uncut Gems\" (2019) - Josh and Benny Safdie\n* \"Promising Young Woman\" (2020) - Emerald Fennell\n* \"Minari\" (2020) - Lee Isaac Chung\n\n#Notes\n\nThe Indiewood movement has had a significant impact on the film industry, paving the way for new types of films and filmmakers. However, the boundaries between Indiewood and mainstream Hollywood continue to blur, and the term itself has become somewhat outdated. Nevertheless, the legacy of Indiewood continues to shape the film industry and inspire new generations of filmmakers.\n\n#See also\n\n* Independent film\n* Art house film\n* Low-budget film\n* Hollywood\n* Film festival\n* Sundance Film Festival\n* Cannes Film Festival\n* Berlin International Film Festival\n\n#References\n\n*Note: References are not included in this text*\n\n#Bibliography\n\n* Biskind, Peter. \"Down and Dirty Pictures: Miramax, Sundance, and the Rise of Independent Film\".

This conflict has been marked by a series of information operations, including censorship, telecommunications disruptions, internet infrastructure manipulation, war propaganda, and control of news outlets. The conflict has also involved the use of disinformation, tropes, and social media manipulation.\n\n# Background\n\n## Doctrine\n\nThe Russian information war against Ukraine is part of a broader doctrine of information warfare, which is a key component of Russian military strategy. This doctrine emphasizes the use of information as a tool of warfare, with the goal of influencing the perceptions and actions of adversaries. The doctrine is outlined in a number of Russian military documents, including the 2014 Military Doctrine of the Russian Federation.\n\n## Reasons for the conflict\n\n### Revanchism\n\nOne of the key reasons for the conflict is revanchism, or the desire to revise the territorial losses suffered by Russia following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The annexation of Crimea in 2014 was a key example of this, as it allowed Russia to regain control of a strategic peninsula that had been part of Ukraine since 1954.\n\n### History of the war\n\nThe conflict between Russia and Ukraine has a long history, dating back to the Kievan Rus' era. However, the modern conflict began in 2014, following the Ukrainian Revolution and the ousting of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. Russia responded to the revolution by annexing Crimea and supporting separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine.\n\n# Information operations\n\n## Censorship\n\nRussia has used censorship as a key tool of information warfare against Ukraine.

This has allowed Russia to promote its own narrative about the conflict and to suppress dissenting voices.\n\n### Public relations\n\nRussia has used public relations as a key tool of information warfare against Ukraine. This has included hiring PR firms to promote Russian interests and to discredit Ukrainian opponents.\n\n### Ukraine\n\nUkraine has also used information operations against Russia, including promoting its own narrative about the conflict and countering Russian propaganda.\n\n### Russia\n\n#### RT\n\nRT, formerly known as Russia Today, is a Russian state-owned television network that has played a key role in promoting Russian propaganda about the conflict.

This has included promoting conspiracy theories about Ukrainian politics and spreading false information about Ukrainian military actions.\n\n### Social media\n\nRussia has used social media as a key tool of information warfare against Ukraine. This has included spreading false information about Ukrainian military actions and promoting conspiracy theories about Ukrainian politics.\n\n#### Access to social media\n\nRussia has controlled access to social media in Ukraine, including blocking access to certain platforms and censoring Russian-language content.\n\n#### Attempts to censor Russian Wikipedia\n\nRussia has attempted to censor Russian Wikipedia, including blocking access to certain pages and promoting alternative narratives about the conflict.\n\n# Timeline\n\n## 2014\n\n### January\n\nIn January 2014, Ukraine experienced a wave of protests against the government of Viktor Yanukovych.\n\n### February\n\nIn February 2014, Yanukovych was ousted as president of Ukraine.\n\n### March\n\nIn March 2014, Russia annexed Crimea.\n\n### April\n\nIn April 2014, pro-Russian separatists declared independence in eastern Ukraine.\n\n### May\n\nIn May 2014, Ukraine held presidential elections.\n\n### June\n\nIn June 2014, Ukrainian forces launched a military operation against pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine.\n\n### July–August\n\nIn July and August 2014, fighting between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatists intensified.\n\n### October\n\nIn October 2014, Ukraine held parliamentary elections.\n\n### December\n\nIn December 2014, Russia and Ukraine signed a ceasefire agreement.\n\n## 2015\n\n### January\n\nIn January 2015, fighting between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatists intensified.\n\n### February\n\nIn February 2015, Russia and Ukraine signed a ceasefire agreement.\n\n### March\n\nIn March 2015, Ukraine launched a military operation against pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine.\n\n### June\n\nIn June 2015, Ukrainian forces launched a military operation against pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine.\n\n## 2016\n\nIn 2016, fighting between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatists continued.\n\n## 2017\n\nIn 2017, Ukraine launched a military operation against pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine.\n\n## 2018\n\nIn 2018, fighting between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatists continued.\n\n## 2019\n\nIn 2019, Ukraine held presidential elections.\n\n## 2021\n\nIn 2021, Ukraine launched a military operation against pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine.\n\n## 2022\n\n### January\n\nIn January 2022, Russia launched a military operation against Ukraine.\n\n### February\n\nIn February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\n### March\n\nIn March 2022, fighting between Ukrainian forces and Russian forces intensified.\n\n# Staged videos\n\nRussia has staged videos as part of its information warfare against Ukraine.

From ancient myths and legends to modern-day bestsellers, fantasy has evolved over time, influenced by changing societal values, technological advancements, and the imaginations of countless authors, artists, and creators. This article provides an overview of the history of fantasy, from its earliest beginnings to the present day.\n\nDifferences between fantasy and earlier fantastic works\n\nWhile fantasy as we know it today is a relatively modern concept, elements of the fantastic have been present in literature and art throughout history. However, there are key differences between these earlier works and modern fantasy. Ancient myths, legends, and folktales often featured supernatural or magical elements, but these were typically presented as factual or historical accounts, rather than as fictional stories. In contrast, modern fantasy often involves the creation of entirely imaginary worlds, creatures, and events.\n\nAdditionally, earlier fantastic works often served a specific purpose, such as explaining natural phenomena, teaching moral lessons, or providing entertainment for a specific audience. Modern fantasy, on the other hand, has evolved into a diverse and complex genre, encompassing a wide range of themes, styles, and sub-genres.\n\nDevelopment of fantasy\n\nThe development of fantasy as a distinct literary genre can be divided into several key periods, each characterized by significant cultural, social, and literary trends.\n\nRomances\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, the romance genre emerged in Europe, particularly in France and England. Romances were long, narrative poems that often featured fantastical elements, such as magical creatures, quests, and supernatural events. These works were typically written in verse and were intended for a courtly audience. Examples of medieval romances include Sir Gawain and the Green Knight and Tristan and Iseult.\n\nThe romance genre played a significant role in the development of fantasy, as it introduced many of the themes and motifs that would become characteristic of the genre, such as the quest, the hero's journey, and the struggle between good and evil.\n\nThe Enlightenment\n\nThe Enlightenment, which spanned the 17th and 18th centuries, marked a significant turning point in the development of fantasy. During this period, there was a growing emphasis on reason, science, and rationalism, which led to a decline in the popularity of fantastical and supernatural themes. However, this did not mean the complete disappearance of fantasy, as many authors continued to write works that featured magical and supernatural elements.\n\nOne notable example of a fantasy work from this period is Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels, which features a series of fantastical voyages to imaginary lands. While not strictly a fantasy novel, Gulliver's Travels contains many elements that would become characteristic of the genre, such as the use of satire, social commentary, and imaginative world-building.\n\nRomanticism\n\nThe Romantic movement, which emerged in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, marked a significant turning point in the development of fantasy. Romantic authors, such as John Keats, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and Lord Byron, emphasized the importance of imagination, emotion, and the individual experience.\n\nDuring this period, fantasy began to take on a more distinct form, with authors such as George MacDonald and William Morris writing works that featured magical and supernatural elements. MacDonald's Phantastes, published in 1858, is often cited as one of the first fantasy novels, and it contains many elements that would become characteristic of the genre, such as the use of symbolism, allegory, and imaginative world-building.\n\nModern fantasy\n\nThe modern fantasy genre, as we know it today, emerged in the early 20th century, particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom. This period saw the rise of popular authors such as J.R.R. Tolkien, C.S. Lewis, and Ursula K. Le Guin, who helped to shape the genre and create many of the themes and motifs that are still present today.\n\nPre-Tolkien\n\nBefore Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, fantasy was a relatively niche genre, with a limited audience and a lack of mainstream recognition. However, there were several authors who were writing fantasy works, including Lord Dunsany, E.R. Eddison, and Hope Mirrlees.\n\nOne notable example of a pre-Tolkien fantasy work is James Branch Cabell's Jurgen, published in 1919. This novel features a series of fantastical adventures, including encounters with magical creatures and supernatural events. While not strictly a fantasy novel, Jurgen contains many elements that would become characteristic of the genre, such as the use of satire, social commentary, and imaginative world-building.\n\nTolkien\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, published in 1954-55, is often cited as the most influential fantasy work of the 20th century. This novel, which tells the story of a quest to destroy the One Ring and save Middle-earth from the dark lord Sauron, introduced many of the themes and motifs that are still present in modern fantasy, including the use of mythology, symbolism, and imaginative world-building.\n\nTolkien's influence on the fantasy genre cannot be overstated, and his work has inspired countless authors, including C.S. Lewis, Ursula K. Le Guin, and Neil Gaiman.\n\nPost-Tolkien\n\nAfter Tolkien, the fantasy genre continued to evolve and diversify, with authors such as Ursula K. Le Guin, Anne McCaffrey, and Terry Pratchett making significant contributions to the genre.\n\nOne notable example of a post-Tolkien fantasy work is Ursula K. Le Guin's A Wizard of Earthsea, published in 1968. This novel, which tells the story of a young wizard's journey to balance the forces of magic and nature, introduced many of the themes and motifs that are still present in modern fantasy, including the use of mythology, symbolism, and imaginative world-building.\n\nIn recent years, the fantasy genre has continued to evolve and diversify, with the rise of new sub-genres, such as urban fantasy, epic fantasy, and fantasy of manners. Authors such as Neil Gaiman, Patrick Rothfuss, and N.K. Jemisin have made significant contributions to the genre, and the fantasy genre continues to be one of the most popular and diverse genres in modern literature.\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\n* Clute, John, and John Grant.

The tournament aims to promote baseball globally and provide a platform for the best players from around the world to compete against each other.\n\n#Background\n\nThe concept of a global baseball tournament dates back to 2000, when the IBAF and MLB first discussed the idea. However, it wasn't until 2005 that the two organizations officially announced the creation of the World Baseball Classic. The tournament was designed to be a premier international baseball competition, featuring the best players from the top baseball-playing countries. The WBC is held every four years, with the first tournament taking place in 2006.\n\n#History\n\n##2006–09: Samurai Japan's back-to-back championships\n\nThe inaugural World Baseball Classic was held in 2006, featuring 16 teams from around the world. The tournament was won by Japan, who defeated Cuba 10-6 in the final. Japan repeated as champions in 2009, defeating South Korea 5-3 in the final. These back-to-back championships cemented Japan's status as a baseball powerhouse and set the tone for the tournament's future success.\n\n##2013: Direct qualification and \"Plátano Power\"\n\nThe 2013 World Baseball Classic saw several changes to the tournament format, including the introduction of direct qualification for the top 12 teams from the previous tournament. The Dominican Republic, led by stars such as David Ortiz and Robinson Cano, dominated the tournament, eventually defeating Puerto Rico 3-0 in the final. The Dominican Republic's championship was marked by their \"Plátano Power\" slogan, which became a rallying cry for the team and their fans.\n\n##2017: American redemption\n\nThe 2017 World Baseball Classic was marked by a resurgence of interest in the tournament, particularly in the United States. The United States team, led by stars such as Bryce Harper and Andrew McCutchen, won the championship, defeating Puerto Rico 8-0 in the final. This marked the first WBC title for the United States, and was seen as a redemption of sorts for the team's disappointing performances in previous tournaments.\n\n##2023: \"Baseball's already won\"\n\nThe 2023 World Baseball Classic was notable for its emphasis on the global nature of the tournament. The slogan \"Baseball's already won\" was used to promote the tournament, highlighting the fact that baseball is a sport that transcends national borders. The tournament was won by Japan, who defeated the United States 3-2 in the final.\n\n##2026 tournament\n\nThe 2026 World Baseball Classic is scheduled to take place in March 2026, with 20 teams participating in the tournament. The tournament will feature several new teams, including Great Britain and the Czech Republic, and will be held in several locations around the world, including the United States, Japan, and Taiwan.\n\n#Format\n\nThe World Baseball Classic is a round-robin tournament, with teams divided into four groups of five teams each. The top two teams from each group advance to the knockout stage, which consists of a quarterfinal round, a semifinal round, and the final. The tournament is typically held over a period of two weeks, with games played at various locations around the world.\n\n#Participation\n\nThe World Baseball Classic features teams from around the world, with participation determined by a combination of qualifying tournaments and automatic bids. The top 12 teams from the previous tournament receive automatic bids, while the remaining teams must qualify through a series of tournaments. The tournament has featured teams from as many as 20 different countries, including Japan, the United States, Cuba, and the Dominican Republic.\n\n#Trophy\n\nThe World Baseball Classic trophy is awarded to the winning team, and is designed to represent the global nature of the tournament. The trophy features a silver and gold design, with a baseball at the center.\n\n#Broadcasting and promotion\n\nThe World Baseball Classic is broadcast in several languages around the world, including English, Spanish, Japanese, and Korean. The tournament is also promoted through social media and other online channels, with a strong emphasis on highlighting the global nature of the tournament.\n\n#Attendance\n\nThe World Baseball Classic has seen steady growth in attendance over the years, with the 2017 tournament drawing a record 973,000 fans. The tournament is typically held in large stadiums around the world, including MLB ballparks and other international venues.\n\n#Venues\n\nThe World Baseball Classic is held in several locations around the world, including the United States, Japan, Taiwan, and the Dominican Republic. The tournament has featured games at iconic stadiums such as Dodger Stadium, AT&T Park, and Tokyo Dome.\n\n#Results\n\n##Performance of nations\n\nSeveral countries have performed well in the World Baseball Classic, including Japan, the United States, and the Dominican Republic. Japan has won the tournament twice, while the United States and the Dominican Republic have each won once.\n\n##Debut of national teams\n\nThe World Baseball Classic has seen the debut of several national teams, including Israel, Colombia, and Italy. These teams have added to the diversity of the tournament and have helped to promote baseball globally.\n\n##Overview\n\nThe World Baseball Classic has become a premier international baseball tournament, featuring the best players from around the world. The tournament has grown in popularity over the years, with a strong emphasis on promoting baseball globally and highlighting the talents of players from different countries.\n\n#Honors\n\n##Most Valuable Player\n\nThe Most Valuable Player award is given to the best player in the tournament, as determined by a panel of judges. Past winners of the award include Daisuke Matsuzaka, Robinson Cano, and Marcus Stroman.\n\n##All-WBC teams\n\nThe All-WBC teams are selected by a panel of judges and feature the best players from the tournament. The teams are typically divided into first and second teams, with players selected based on their performance during the tournament.\n\n##Statistical leaders\n\nThe World Baseball Classic features several statistical leaders, including leaders in batting average, home runs, and ERA.

This can be done during live play, stoppages of play, or a combination of both. The rules regarding free substitution vary across different sports and leagues, with some allowing unlimited substitutions, while others have limitations on the number of substitutions that can be made.\n\n#Sports that allow free substitution\n\n##Sports that allow unlimited substitution during live play\n\nSome sports allow teams to make unlimited substitutions during live play, without any restrictions on the number of substitutions or the timing of substitutions. Examples of such sports include:\n\n* Ice hockey: Teams are allowed to make substitutions on the fly, with players entering and leaving the game through the designated substitution area.\n* Lacrosse: Players can be substituted in and out of the game during live play, with no restrictions on the number of substitutions.\n* Field hockey: Teams are allowed to make substitutions during live play, with players entering and leaving the game through the designated substitution area.\n* Rugby sevens: Teams are allowed to make unlimited substitutions during live play, with players entering and leaving the game through the designated substitution area.\n\nThese sports typically have a fast-paced and high-intensity nature, and the ability to make unlimited substitutions allows teams to maintain a high level of energy and intensity throughout the game.\n\n##Sports that allow unlimited substitutions during stoppages of play only\n\nSome sports allow teams to make unlimited substitutions during stoppages of play, but not during live play. Examples of such sports include:\n\n* Basketball: Teams are allowed to make unlimited substitutions during stoppages of play, such as during timeouts or between quarters.\n* Football: Teams are allowed to make unlimited substitutions during stoppages of play, such as during timeouts or between quarters.\n* Volleyball: Teams are allowed to make unlimited substitutions during stoppages of play, such as during timeouts or between sets.\n\nThese sports typically have a more stop-start nature, with frequent stoppages of play allowing teams to make substitutions and adjust their strategy.\n\n#Sports with limited substitution\n\n##Sports that allow a limited number of substitutions\n\nSome sports allow teams to make a limited number of substitutions during the game. Examples of such sports include:\n\n* Football: Teams are allowed to make a limited number of substitutions during the game, typically three or four per game.\n* Baseball: Teams are allowed to make a limited number of substitutions during the game, typically one or two per game.\n* Cricket: Teams are allowed to make a limited number of substitutions during the game, typically one or two per game.\n\nThese sports typically have a more strategic nature, with teams needing to carefully manage their substitutions to gain a competitive advantage.\n\n##Sports that only allow substitution to replace injured players\n\nSome sports only allow teams to make substitutions to replace injured players. Examples of such sports include:\n\n* Tennis: Players can only be substituted if they are injured, and the substitution must be approved by the tournament referee.\n* Golf: Players can only be substituted if they are injured, and the substitution must be approved by the tournament committee.\n* Equestrian sports: Riders can only be substituted if they are injured, and the substitution must be approved by the competition committee.\n\nThese sports typically have a more individual nature, with players competing alone or in small teams, and the risk of injury is relatively low.\n\n#Sports with mixed or hybrid systems\n\nSome sports have a mixed or hybrid system, where teams can make unlimited substitutions during certain periods of the game, but are limited in other periods. Examples of such sports include:\n\n* Water polo: Teams can make unlimited substitutions during certain periods of the game, but are limited during other periods.\n* Handball: Teams can make unlimited substitutions during certain periods of the game, but are limited during other periods.\n* Futsal: Teams can make unlimited substitutions during certain periods of the game, but are limited during other periods.\n\nThese sports typically have a fast-paced and high-intensity nature, and the mixed or hybrid system allows teams to maintain a high level of energy and intensity throughout the game.\n\n#See also\n\n* Substitution (sports)\n* Team sport\n* Strategy (game theory)\n\n#Notes\n\nThe rules regarding free substitution vary across different sports and leagues, and this article is intended to provide a general overview of the different systems used in various sports.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Free_substitution\" following this outline:\n\n#Sports that allow free substitution\n##Sports that allow unlimited substitution during live play\n##Sports that allow unlimited substitutions during stoppages of play only\n#Sports with limited substitution\n##Sports that allow a limited number of substitutions\n##Sports that only allow substitution to replace injured players\n#Sports with mixed or hybrid systems\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The strike, which began on July 14, 2023, was the first major labor dispute in the entertainment industry since the 2007-2008 Writers Guild of America strike.\n\n# Background\n\n## Unionization in Hollywood\n\nThe entertainment industry has a long history of unionization, dating back to the 1930s when the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) was formed. Over the years, other unions, including the Writers Guild of America (WGA) and the Directors Guild of America (DGA), were established to represent the interests of writers, directors, and other industry professionals. In 2012, SAG merged with the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA) to form SAG-AFTRA, which represents over 160,000 actors, announcers, and other industry professionals.\n\n## Pre-strike activity\n\nIn the months leading up to the strike, SAG-AFTRA and the AMPTP engaged in negotiations over a new collective bargaining agreement (CBA). The main issues of contention were compensation for actors working in the rapidly growing streaming industry, residuals for reruns of TV shows and films, and the use of artificial intelligence in film and television production. SAG-AFTRA sought increased compensation for its members, as well as greater transparency and accountability from the studios. The AMPTP, on the other hand, pushed for greater flexibility in its ability to produce and distribute content.\n\n# Timeline\n\n## July\n\nThe strike began on July 14, 2023, after SAG-AFTRA and the AMPTP failed to reach an agreement on a new CBA. The strike was authorized by a vote of the SAG-AFTRA membership, with over 98% of members voting in favor of the strike. The strike affected film and television production across the United States, with many productions shutting down or delaying production.\n\n## August\n\nAs the strike entered its second month, the impact on the entertainment industry began to be felt. Many film and television productions were forced to shut down, and the strike began to affect other industries, such as tourism and hospitality. The AMPTP launched a public relations campaign, arguing that the strike was unnecessary and that SAG-AFTRA's demands were unreasonable.\n\n## September\n\nIn September, SAG-AFTRA and the AMPTP resumed negotiations, but the talks broke down after several days. The strike continued, with many SAG-AFTRA members picketing outside film and television studios. The strike also began to affect the advertising industry, with many commercial productions shutting down.\n\n## October\n\nAs the strike entered its fourth month, the impact on the entertainment industry began to be felt more widely. Many film and television productions were forced to shut down, and the strike began to affect the awards season, with many awards shows being cancelled or postponed.\n\n## November\n\nIn November, SAG-AFTRA and the AMPTP resumed negotiations, and after several weeks of talks, a tentative agreement was reached. The agreement included increased compensation for actors working in the streaming industry, as well as greater transparency and accountability from the studios.\n\n## December\n\nThe tentative agreement was ratified by the SAG-AFTRA membership in December, bringing an end to the strike. The agreement was seen as a major victory for SAG-AFTRA, and marked a significant shift in the balance of power between the studios and the talent.\n\n# Strike activity and responses\n\n## Locations\n\nThe strike was felt across the United States, with many film and television productions shutting down or delaying production. The strike was particularly felt in Los Angeles and New York City, which are home to many film and television studios.\n\n## Media executives' response\n\nThe AMPTP and other media executives responded to the strike by launching a public relations campaign, arguing that the strike was unnecessary and that SAG-AFTRA's demands were unreasonable. Many media executives also sought to minimize the impact of the strike, arguing that the entertainment industry was resilient and would bounce back quickly.\n\n## Politicians' response\n\nMany politicians, including those from California and New York, responded to the strike by calling for both sides to negotiate in good faith. Some politicians also sought to intervene in the strike, offering to mediate talks between SAG-AFTRA and the AMPTP.\n\n## Other unions' response\n\nMany other unions in the entertainment industry, including the WGA and the DGA, responded to the strike by offering support to SAG-AFTRA. Some unions also sought to take advantage of the strike, pushing for their own demands and concessions from the studios.\n\n## Other organizations' response\n\nMany other organizations, including the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) and the National Association of Theatre Owners (NATO), responded to the strike by launching public relations campaigns and seeking to minimize the impact of the strike.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe strike had a significant impact on the entertainment industry, with many film and television productions shutting down or delaying production. The strike also affected other industries, such as tourism and hospitality, and had a major impact on the awards season.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe strike marked a significant shift in the balance of power between the studios and the talent, with SAG-AFTRA emerging as a major player in the entertainment industry. The strike also had a major impact on the entertainment industry, with many film and television productions being forced to shut down or delay production.\n\n# See also\n\n* 2007-2008 Writers Guild of America strike\n* Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists\n* Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a general overview of the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike.

Lee at the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863. He served as a corps commander in the Union Army during the American Civil War, and later became a prominent figure in the post-war Reconstruction era.\n\n#Early life and education\n\nMeade was born on December 31, 1815, in Cádiz, Spain, where his father, Richard Worsam Meade, was serving as a naval officer. The family later moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where Meade grew up and developed an interest in military affairs. He attended the Mount Hope Institution in Baltimore, Maryland, before entering the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1831.\n\nMeade graduated from West Point in 1835, ranking 19th out of 56 cadets. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 3rd United States Artillery Regiment and began his military career, serving in various posts along the Atlantic coast and in the Florida Territory.\n\n#Topographical Corps and Mexican-American War\n\nIn 1836, Meade was assigned to the Topographical Corps, a unit responsible for mapping and surveying the country. He worked on various projects, including the survey of the Great Lakes and the mapping of the Oregon Territory. Meade's work in the Topographical Corps helped him develop his skills as an engineer and cartographer.\n\nDuring the Mexican-American War, Meade served as a staff officer and engineer, participating in the battles of Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma. He was promoted to first lieutenant in 1846 and later served as the chief engineer of the army's 1st Division.\n\n#American Civil War\n\n##Peninsula campaign\n\nAt the outbreak of the American Civil War, Meade was appointed colonel of the 2nd Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment.

He was promoted to brigadier general in November 1862 and given command of the 2nd Brigade, 1st Division, I Corps.\n\n##Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville\n\nMeade served in the battles of Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville, where he was wounded again. Despite his injuries, he continued to command his brigade, earning a reputation as a skilled and courageous leader.\n\n##Gettysburg campaign\n\n###Command of the Army of the Potomac\n\nIn June 1863, Meade was appointed commander of the Army of the Potomac, replacing General Joseph Hooker. He led the army into the Gettysburg campaign, where he would face his greatest challenge as a commander.\n\n###Battle of Gettysburg\n\nThe Battle of Gettysburg was a turning point in the war, as Meade's Army of the Potomac defeated Lee's Army of Northern Virginia in a three-day battle. Meade's leadership and tactical decisions played a crucial role in the Union victory, as he skillfully deployed his troops to defend against Lee's attacks.\n\n###Lee's retreat\n\nAfter the battle, Meade pursued Lee's retreating army, but he was criticized for not destroying the Confederate forces. Despite this criticism, Meade's victory at Gettysburg had a significant impact on the war, as it repelled the Confederate invasion of the North and set the stage for the ultimate defeat of the Confederacy.\n\n##Bristoe and Mine Run campaign\n\nIn the fall of 1863, Meade led the Army of the Potomac in the Bristoe and Mine Run campaigns, where he clashed with Lee's forces in a series of skirmishes and battles.\n\n##Overland campaign\n\nIn the spring of 1864, Meade served in the Overland campaign, fighting in the battles of the Wilderness and Spotsylvania Courthouse. He was criticized for his handling of the campaign, as he was unable to defeat Lee's forces decisively.\n\n##Richmond-Petersburg campaign\n\nMeade played a key role in the Richmond-Petersburg campaign, where he served as the commander of the Army of the Potomac. He led the army in the siege of Petersburg, where he worked closely with General Ulysses S. Grant to ultimately defeat Lee's forces.\n\n##Political rivalries\n\nMeade was involved in several political rivalries during the war, including a feud with General Ambrose Burnside. He was also critical of General Joseph Hooker, whom he replaced as commander of the Army of the Potomac.\n\n#Reconstruction\n\nAfter the war, Meade served in the Reconstruction era, commanding the Military Division of the Atlantic. He played a key role in the occupation of the South, working to establish order and ensure the rights of freed slaves.\n\n#Personal life\n\nMeade married Margaretta Sergeant, the daughter of a prominent Philadelphia family, in 1840. The couple had seven children together, including a son who died in infancy. Meade was known for his strong family values and his commitment to his wife and children.\n\n#Later life and death\n\nMeade died on November 6, 1872, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, due to complications from pneumonia. He was 56 years old. Meade was buried in Laurel Hill Cemetery, where many other prominent Philadelphians are interred.\n\n#Legacy\n\nMeade's legacy as a commander is complex and multifaceted. He is remembered for his bravery and tactical skills, as well as his leadership during the Battle of Gettysburg. However, he is also criticized for his handling of the Overland campaign and his inability to destroy Lee's forces.\n\n##Memorials to Meade\n\nMeade is remembered in several memorials and monuments, including a statue in Fairmount Park, Philadelphia. He is also honored in the Gettysburg National Military Park, where a monument commemorates his leadership during the Battle of Gettysburg.\n\n#In popular culture\n\nMeade has been portrayed in several films and television shows, including the 1993 film \"Gettysburg\" and the 2011 film \"Lincoln.\" He has also been the subject of several books and documentaries.\n\n#Dates of rank\n\n* Second Lieutenant: July 1, 1835\n* First Lieutenant: August 31, 1836\n* Captain: August 19, 1846\n* Major: May 14, 1861\n* Brigadier General: November 29, 1861\n* Major General: November 29, 1862\n* Brevet Major General: August 18, 1864\n\n#See also\n\n* American Civil War\n* Battle of Gettysburg\n* Gettysburg National Military Park\n* List of American Civil War generals (Union)\n* List of United States Military Academy alumni\n\n#References\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements.)\n\n#External links\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements.)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"George_Meade\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and education\n#Topographical Corps and Mexican-American War\n#American Civil War\n##Peninsula campaign\n##Maryland campaign\n##Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville\n##Gettysburg campaign\n###Command of the Army of the Potomac\n###Battle of Gettysburg\n###Lee's retreat\n##Bristoe and Mine Run campaign\n##Overland campaign\n##Richmond-Petersburg campaign\n##Political rivalries\n#Reconstruction\n#Personal life\n#Later life and death\n#Legacy\n##Memorials to Meade\n#In popular culture\n#Dates of rank\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This move was seen as a significant escalation of Russia's involvement in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, which had begun in February 2022. The mobilization was aimed at recruiting an additional 300,000 soldiers to bolster Russia's military efforts in Ukraine.\n\n#Background\n\n##Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics\n\nIn the spring of 2022, Russian-backed separatists in the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics (DPR and LPR) in eastern Ukraine began to face significant losses against the Ukrainian military. The separatists had been fighting Ukrainian government forces since 2014, with Russian support. However, by 2022, the Ukrainian military had gained the upper hand, and the separatists were struggling to hold their ground.\n\n##Russia\n\n###Russian losses\n\nThe Russian military had also suffered significant losses in the conflict, particularly in the early stages of the invasion. Estimates suggested that Russia had lost tens of thousands of soldiers, as well as significant amounts of military equipment. The losses had put pressure on the Russian government to take action to bolster its military efforts in Ukraine.\n\n#Prelude\n\n##Volunteer recruitment campaign\n\nIn the months leading up to the mobilization, the Russian government had launched a volunteer recruitment campaign, aimed at recruiting civilians to join the military effort in Ukraine. The campaign had been relatively unsuccessful, with few civilians coming forward to join the fight.\n\n##Legislative changes\n\nIn September 2022, the Russian government introduced legislative changes aimed at facilitating the mobilization of the military. The changes included amendments to the Russian Military Code, which allowed for the mobilization of citizens with military experience.\n\n##Recruitment of prisoners\n\nThere were also reports of the Russian government recruiting prisoners to fight in Ukraine. The recruitment of prisoners was seen as a way for the government to bolster its military efforts, while also reducing the number of prisoners in Russian jails.\n\n#Putin's speech\n\nOn September 21, 2022, President Putin delivered a televised address to the nation, in which he announced the partial mobilization of the Russian Armed Forces. Putin stated that the mobilization was necessary to protect Russian citizens and the country's territorial integrity.\n\n#Decree\n\n##Official publication and entry into force\n\nFollowing Putin's speech, a presidential decree was published, outlining the details of the mobilization. The decree came into force immediately, with the mobilization set to begin on September 22, 2022.\n\n##Point 7\n\nThe decree included a point (Point 7) which stated that the mobilization would apply to citizens with military experience, as well as those who had been trained in military specialties. The point was seen as a way for the government to target specific individuals with relevant skills and experience.\n\n#Organization\n\n##Text of decree\n\nThe text of the decree outlined the details of the mobilization, including the number of citizens to be recruited and the timeline for the mobilization. The decree also established a special mobilization commission, which would be responsible for overseeing the mobilization effort.\n\n##Citizens to be mobilized\n\nThe decree stated that citizens with military experience, as well as those who had been trained in military specialties, would be subject to mobilization. The decree also stated that citizens who had been convicted of serious crimes would not be eligible for mobilization.\n\n#Implementation\n\n##Dates\n\nThe mobilization was set to begin on September 22, 2022, and was expected to last for several weeks. The exact dates for the mobilization were not specified in the decree, but it was reported that the mobilization would take place in stages, with different groups of citizens being called up at different times.\n\n#Reactions\n\n##In Russia\n\n###Markets\n\nThe announcement of the mobilization led to a significant decline in Russian stock markets, with the ruble also falling in value. The decline was seen as a reflection of investor concerns about the impact of the mobilization on the Russian economy.\n\n###Russian officials and their families\n\nThere were reports of Russian officials and their families fleeing the country in the aftermath of the mobilization announcement. The reports were seen as a sign of concern among Russian elites about the potential consequences of the mobilization.\n\n###Within the Russian military\n\nThere were also reports of concerns within the Russian military about the mobilization. Some military officials were reportedly opposed to the mobilization, citing concerns about the impact on military morale and the potential for casualties.\n\n###Help for army conscripts\n\nIn the aftermath of the mobilization announcement, there were reports of Russian citizens offering help to army conscripts, including food and clothing. The offers of help were seen as a sign of public support for the military.\n\n###Exodus of Russians\n\nThe mobilization announcement also led to an exodus of Russians from the country, with many citizens fleeing to neighboring countries or further afield. The exodus was seen as a sign of concern among Russians about the potential consequences of the mobilization.\n\n###Protests\n\nThere were also reports of protests against the mobilization, with some Russian citizens taking to the streets to express their opposition. The protests were seen as a sign of public discontent with the government's decision.\n\n###Attacks\n\nIn the aftermath of the mobilization announcement, there were reports of attacks on military recruitment centers and other government buildings. The attacks were seen as a sign of opposition to the mobilization.\n\n##In Ukraine\n\nThe Ukrainian government welcomed the news of the mobilization, seeing it as a sign of weakness on the part of the Russian government. Ukrainian officials stated that the mobilization would not change the outcome of the conflict, and that Ukraine would continue to defend its territory.\n\n##International\n\nThe international community was critical of the mobilization, with many countries condemning the move as a sign of Russian aggression. The United States, the European Union, and other countries imposed sanctions on Russia in response to the mobilization.\n\n#Analysis\n\n##Casualties\n\nThe mobilization was seen as a sign of concern among Russian officials about the potential for casualties in the conflict. The exact number of casualties was not known, but it was reported that the Russian military had suffered significant losses in the conflict.\n\n#See also\n\n* 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* Russian Armed Forces\n* Donetsk People's Republic\n* Luhansk People's Republic\n\n#Notes\n\n#References", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Russian_mobilization\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics\n##Russia\n###Russian losses\n#Prelude\n##Volunteer recruitment campaign\n##Legislative changes\n##Recruitment of prisoners\n#Putin's speech\n#Decree\n##Official publication and entry into force\n##Point 7\n#Organization\n##Text of decree\n##Citizens to be mobilized\n#Implementation\n##Dates\n#Reactions\n##In Russia\n###Markets\n###Russian officials and their families\n###Within the Russian military\n###Help for army conscripts\n###Exodus of Russians\n###Protests\n###Attacks\n##In Ukraine\n##International\n#Analysis\n##Casualties\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

With a career spanning over five decades, Hersh has established himself as one of the most respected and influential investigative journalists of his generation.\n\nEarly Life and Education\n------------------------\n\nSeymour Hersh was born on April 8, 1937, in Chicago, Illinois, to a family of Jewish immigrants. He grew up in a middle-class neighborhood and developed an interest in journalism at an early age. Hersh attended the University of Chicago, where he studied history and graduated in 1958. After college, he worked as a police reporter for the City News Bureau of Chicago.\n\nNewspaper Career\n----------------\n\nHersh's early career in journalism was marked by his work as a police reporter and later as a correspondent for the Associated Press. In the 1960s, he began to focus on investigative reporting, covering topics such as the Vietnam War and the Nixon administration.\n\n### My Lai Massacre\n\nIn 1969, Hersh broke the story of the My Lai Massacre, a mass killing of Vietnamese civilians by American soldiers during the Vietnam War. His reporting on the incident, which was initially met with skepticism and denial by the US military, was later confirmed and led to widespread outrage and calls for accountability. Hersh's coverage of the My Lai Massacre earned him the Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting in 1970.\n\n### The New York Times\n\nIn the 1970s, Hersh joined The New York Times as an investigative reporter, where he continued to cover major national security issues. His reporting on the CIA's domestic spying operations and the Nixon administration's involvement in the Watergate scandal further solidified his reputation as a leading investigative journalist.\n\nInvestigative Books: 1980s and 1990s\n-----------------------------------\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, Hersh published several investigative books, including \"The Price of Power: Kissinger in the Nixon White House\" (1983) and \"The Samson Option: Israel's Nuclear Arsenal and American Foreign Policy\" (1991). These books, which explored the inner workings of the US government and its foreign policy decisions, were widely praised for their meticulous research and insightful analysis.\n\nLater Investigations\n---------------------\n\n### Iraq and Abu Ghraib\n\nIn the 2000s, Hersh turned his attention to the US-led invasion of Iraq and the subsequent occupation. His reporting on the Abu Ghraib prison abuse scandal, which was published in The New Yorker in 2004, revealed widespread human rights abuses and mistreatment of detainees by US soldiers. Hersh's coverage of the scandal led to widespread outrage and calls for accountability.\n\n### Iran\n\nHersh has also reported extensively on US-Iran relations, including the Bush administration's efforts to undermine the Iranian government and the CIA's covert operations in the region. In 2006, he published a series of articles in The New Yorker on the US military's plans for a potential attack on Iran, which sparked widespread debate and controversy.\n\n### Syria and Chemical Attacks\n\nIn 2013, Hersh reported on the use of chemical weapons in Syria, which was widely attributed to the Syrian government. However, Hersh's reporting suggested that the attacks may have been carried out by opposition forces, rather than the government. His articles on the topic sparked controversy and debate, with some critics accusing him of promoting conspiracy theories.\n\n### Killing of Osama bin Laden\n\nIn 2015, Hersh published a series of articles in the London Review of Books on the killing of Osama bin Laden, which challenged the official US narrative of the event. According to Hersh, the US government had been working with Pakistani intelligence to locate and capture bin Laden, and the raid on his compound was not the result of a heroic US operation, but rather a carefully planned and executed joint operation.\n\n### Nord Stream pipeline and Ukraine\n\nIn 2023, Hersh reported on the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipeline, which he attributed to the US government. According to Hersh, the US had been working to disrupt the pipeline, which was seen as a major threat to US energy interests in Europe. His reporting on the topic sparked widespread controversy and debate.\n\nOther Statements\n-----------------\n\n### Speeches\n\nHersh has given numerous speeches and lectures on topics such as national security, journalism, and government accountability. In 2013, he delivered a speech at the University of Chicago, in which he criticized the US government's handling of the Snowden leaks and the NSA's domestic spying operations.\n\n### Murder of Seth Rich\n\nIn 2017, Hersh reported on the murder of Seth Rich, a Democratic National Committee staffer who was killed in Washington, D.C. in 2016. According to Hersh, Rich had been in contact with WikiLeaks and had provided the organization with sensitive information about the Democratic Party. Hersh's reporting on the topic sparked controversy and debate, with some critics accusing him of promoting conspiracy theories.\n\n### Pat Nixon Abuse\n\nIn 2019, Hersh reported on allegations of physical abuse by Pat Nixon, the wife of former President Richard Nixon. According to Hersh, Pat Nixon had been physically abusive to her husband and had also been involved in a number of other scandals. Hersh's reporting on the topic sparked widespread controversy and debate.\n\nUse of Anonymous Sources\n-------------------------\n\nHersh has been criticized for his use of anonymous sources in his reporting. However, he has defended his use of such sources, arguing that they are often necessary to obtain sensitive information and to protect whistleblowers and other sources from retaliation.\n\nPersonal Life\n-------------\n\nHersh is married to Elizabeth Sarah Klein, and they have two children together.

He is considered one of the most notorious figures in French history, and his life has been the subject of numerous literary and artistic works. Despite his later notoriety, de Rais was a prominent figure in his time, serving as a military leader during the Hundred Years' War and a companion in arms to Joan of Arc.\n\nHouse of Retz\n-------------\n\n### Early life\n\nGilles de Rais was born in 1404, the son of Guy de Laval and Marie de Craon. His family, the House of Retz, was a powerful and influential noble family in Brittany. De Rais was raised with the expectation that he would become a military leader and eventually inherit the family's titles and estates.\n\n### Matrimonial projects\n\nDe Rais was engaged to be married to several different women during his youth, but none of these engagements ultimately resulted in marriage. His family's wealth and influence made him a desirable match, but de Rais's own preferences and interests seemed to lie elsewhere.\n\n### Family disputes\n\nDe Rais's family was involved in several disputes and power struggles during his youth, including a bitter rivalry with the family of Jean V, Duke of Brittany. These disputes would eventually contribute to de Rais's own downfall.\n\n### Titles, estates and wealth\n\nDe Rais inherited a number of titles and estates from his family, including the lordship of Retz, the barony of Ingrande, and the county of Brienne. He was one of the wealthiest men in France, with an annual income of over 40,000 livres.\n\nMilitary career\n---------------\n\n### First hypothetical feat of arms\n\nDe Rais's military career is believed to have begun during the siege of Harfleur in 1415, although there is some debate about the accuracy of this account.\n\n### Franco-Breton alliance through the House of Valois-Anjou\n\nDe Rais formed an alliance with the House of Valois-Anjou, a powerful noble family with close ties to the French monarchy. This alliance helped to secure de Rais's position as a military leader and paved the way for his later successes.\n\n### Guerilla warfare against English garrisons on the borders of Maine\n\nDe Rais served as a military leader during the Hundred Years' War, leading a series of successful raids against English garrisons on the borders of Maine. His military prowess and bravery earned him recognition and respect from his peers.\n\n### Companion in arms with Joan of Arc\n\nDe Rais served as a companion in arms to Joan of Arc, the famous French heroine who led the French army to several victories during the Hundred Years' War. De Rais's relationship with Joan of Arc has been the subject of much speculation and debate.\n\n### Civil wars between La Trémoille and Richemont's allies\n\nDe Rais became embroiled in the civil wars between the factions of La Trémoille and Richemont, two powerful noble families with close ties to the French monarchy. De Rais ultimately allied himself with the faction of Richemont.\n\n### Lifting of the siege of Lagny\n\nDe Rais played a key role in the lifting of the siege of Lagny, a strategic city that controlled access to the Île-de-France. His military leadership and bravery helped to secure a French victory.\n\n### Reduction of military commitments\n\nFollowing the lifting of the siege of Lagny, de Rais began to reduce his military commitments, eventually retiring from active military service.\n\nSquandering of heritage\n----------------------\n\nDe Rais's later years were marked by a series of reckless and extravagant spending sprees, which ultimately led to the squandering of his family's wealth and heritage. He spent vast sums of money on lavish parties, expensive clothing, and other frivolities.\n\nCriminal life\n-------------\n\n### Occult involvement\n\nDe Rais became involved in the occult, reportedly making a pact with the devil and engaging in various forms of black magic. His occult activities have been the subject of much speculation and debate.\n\n### Child murders\n\nDe Rais was accused of murdering a number of children, reportedly using their bodies in his occult rituals. The exact number of victims is unknown, but estimates range from several dozen to over 600.\n\n### Act of force in Saint-Étienne-de-Mer-Morte\n\nDe Rais was accused of committing an act of force in the village of Saint-Étienne-de-Mer-Morte, reportedly kidnapping and murdering a number of children.\n\n### Ecclesiastical and secular investigations\n\nDe Rais was investigated by both ecclesiastical and secular authorities, who gathered evidence of his crimes and eventually brought him to trial.\n\n### Trial and execution\n\nDe Rais was tried and convicted of his crimes, and was subsequently executed by hanging on October 26, 1440.\n\nQuestion of guilt\n-----------------\n\n### Doubts about the verdict in the Age of Enlightenment tradition\n\nSome historians have questioned the verdict in de Rais's trial, citing concerns about the reliability of the evidence and the fairness of the proceedings.\n\n### Occultist interpretations\n\nSome occultists have interpreted de Rais's crimes as a form of spiritual practice, citing his involvement in the occult and his reported pact with the devil.\n\n### Georges Bataille's interpretations\n\nThe French philosopher Georges Bataille wrote extensively about de Rais, interpreting his crimes as a form of transgressive and subversive behavior.\n\n### 1992 mock re-trial\n\nIn 1992, a mock re-trial of de Rais was held, with a panel of historians and lawyers re-examining the evidence and rendering a verdict. The mock trial found de Rais guilty, but raised questions about the fairness of the original proceedings.\n\n### Contemporary academic views\n\nMost contemporary academics view de Rais as a serial killer and a child murderer, citing the overwhelming evidence of his guilt.\n\nFictional portraits\n-------------------\n\nDe Rais has been the subject of numerous literary and artistic works, including novels, plays, and films. His life and crimes have inspired a range of fictional portraits, from the sympathetic to the condemnatory.\n\nPsychopathological interpretations\n---------------------------------\n\n### Fin de siècle portrayals\n\nDe Rais was often portrayed as a decadent and degenerate figure during the fin de siècle period, reflecting contemporary concerns about the decline of morality and the rise of crime.\n\n### Classification as a serial killer\n\nDe Rais is often classified as a serial killer, reflecting his reported involvement in the murders of multiple children.\n\nGilles de Rais and the Bluebeard myth\n--------------------------------------\n\nDe Rais's crimes have been linked to the Bluebeard myth, a famous fairy tale about a serial killer who murders his wives. Some scholars have argued that de Rais's crimes may have inspired the development of the Bluebeard myth.\n\nRelationship with Joan of Arc\n------------------------------\n\nDe Rais's relationship with Joan of Arc has been the subject of much speculation and debate. Some scholars have argued that de Rais may have been inspired by Joan's bravery and military leadership, while others have suggested that their relationship may have been more complex and nuanced.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* List of serial killers\n* List of French serial killers\n* Child murder\n* Occultism\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n### Notes\n\n### Footnotes\n\n### Bibliography\n\n#### Historical studies and literary scholarship\n\n#### Essays", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Gilles_de_Rais\" following this outline:\n\n#House of Retz\n##Early life\n##Matrimonial projects\n##Family disputes\n##Titles, estates and wealth\n#Military career\n##First hypothetical feat of arms\n##Franco-Breton alliance through the House of Valois-Anjou\n##Guerilla warfare against English garrisons on the borders of Maine\n##Companion in arms with Joan of Arc\n##Civil wars between La Trémoille and Richemont's allies\n##Lifting of the siege of Lagny\n##Reduction of military commitments\n#Squandering of heritage\n#Criminal life\n##Occult involvement\n##Child murders\n##Act of force in Saint-Étienne-de-Mer-Morte\n##Ecclesiastical and secular investigations\n##Trial and execution\n#Question of guilt\n##Doubts about the verdict in the Age of Enlightenment tradition\n##Occultist interpretations\n##Georges Bataille's interpretations\n##1992 mock re-trial\n##Contemporary academic views\n#Fictional portraits\n#Psychopathological interpretations\n##Fin de siècle portrayals\n##Classification as a serial killer\n#Gilles de Rais and the Bluebeard myth\n#Relationship with Joan of Arc\n#See also\n#References\n##Notes\n##Footnotes\n##Bibliography\n###Historical studies and literary scholarship\n###Essays\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The early Renaissance period, from the 14th to the early 15th century, saw the emergence of artists such as Donatello and Jacopo della Quercia, who were influenced by classical models. The mid-15th century saw the rise of the Medici family in Florence, who became major patrons of the arts, and the development of a more naturalistic style. The late 15th and early 16th centuries saw the emergence of Michelangelo and other artists who pushed the boundaries of sculpture.\n\n#Materials\n\nItalian Renaissance sculptors worked with a variety of materials, each with its own unique characteristics and challenges.\n\n##Stone\n\nMarble, limestone, and other types of stone were popular materials for sculpture during the Italian Renaissance.

Terracotta was prized for its versatility and ability to be molded into intricate forms.\n\n##Other materials\n\nOther materials, such as ivory, wax, and plaster, were also used for sculpture during the Italian Renaissance. These materials were often used for smaller works or for creating models for larger sculptures.\n\n##Coloured sculpture\n\nColoured sculpture, where the material itself is coloured, was also a feature of Italian Renaissance sculpture. This was particularly evident in the use of coloured marbles, such as the vibrant red and green marbles used in the decoration of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.\n\n#Settings\n\nItalian Renaissance sculpture was often created for specific settings, such as churches, tombs, and public spaces.\n\n##Churches and tombs\n\nMany Italian Renaissance sculptures were created for churches and tombs.

Many cities in Italy commissioned sculptures to decorate their public spaces and to commemorate important events.\n\n###Fountains\n\nFountains were a popular feature of Italian Renaissance public spaces, and were often decorated with sculptures. These sculptures often depicted mythological scenes or figures, and were intended to add beauty and elegance to the surrounding area.\n\n##Portraits\n\nPortraits were a common type of Italian Renaissance sculpture. These sculptures often depicted wealthy patrons or powerful leaders, and were intended to convey their status and importance.\n\n###Equestrian statues\n\nEquestrian statues, which depicted the subject on horseback, were a popular type of Italian Renaissance sculpture. These statues often commemorated military victories or celebrated the power and status of the subject.\n\n###Shoulder busts\n\nShoulder busts, which depicted the subject from the shoulders up, were another popular type of Italian Renaissance sculpture. These busts often depicted wealthy patrons or powerful leaders, and were intended to convey their status and importance.\n\n###Medals\n\nMedals, small sculptures that were often worn as pendants or attached to clothing, were also a popular type of Italian Renaissance sculpture. These medals often depicted portraits or scenes from mythology, and were intended to add beauty and elegance to the wearer's attire.\n\n##Small sculpture\n\nSmall sculpture, such as figurines or decorative objects, was also a feature of Italian Renaissance sculpture. These small sculptures often depicted mythological scenes or figures, and were intended to add beauty and elegance to the surrounding area.\n\n#Workshops\n\nMany Italian Renaissance sculptors worked in workshops, where they collaborated with other artists and apprentices to create sculptures.\n\n##Women sculptors\n\nWomen sculptors, such as Properzia de' Rossi and Sofonisba Anguissola, also played a significant role in Italian Renaissance sculpture. These women often worked in workshops and created sculptures that were highly regarded by their contemporaries.\n\n#Guilds\n\nGuilds, organizations that represented the interests of artists and craftspeople, played an important role in Italian Renaissance sculpture. These guilds often set standards for the quality of sculptures and provided training and support for young artists.\n\n#Patrons\n\nPatrons, wealthy and powerful individuals who commissioned sculptures, played a significant role in Italian Renaissance sculpture. These patrons often had a significant influence on the style and content of sculptures, and were responsible for promoting the careers of many famous Renaissance sculptors.\n\n#Development of style\n\nThe development of Italian Renaissance sculpture was influenced by a variety of factors, including classical models, the emergence of humanism, and the patronage of wealthy and powerful individuals.\n\n##To 1400\n\nThe early Renaissance period, from the 14th to the early 15th century, saw the emergence of artists such as Donatello and Jacopo della Quercia, who were influenced by classical models.

From its humble beginnings as a Jewish sect in the 1st century to its current status as a global religion with over 2 billion adherents, Christianity has undergone numerous transformations, challenges, and developments. This article provides an overview of the major periods and events in the history of Christianity.\n\n# Early Christianity\n\n## Jewish background\n\nChristianity emerged from Judaism in the 1st century. Jesus of Nazareth, a Jewish teacher and prophet, preached about the kingdom of God and attracted a following of Jews and non-Jews. After his death and resurrection, his disciples, led by Peter and Paul, spread his teachings throughout the Mediterranean world.\n\n## Apostolic Age (c. 30–100)\n\n### Developing church structure\n\nDuring the Apostolic Age, the early Christian communities developed a loose network of leaders, including apostles, prophets, and elders. The Jerusalem church, led by James, brother of Jesus, served as a central authority. As the church grew, the need for a more formal structure became apparent.\n\n### Early growth\n\nChristianity spread rapidly throughout the Roman Empire, particularly among the Jewish diaspora and Gentile (non-Jewish) populations. The apostles and other missionaries preached about Jesus, performed miracles, and established churches in various cities. The early Christian communities were known for their charitable works, communal living, and worship practices.\n\n## Ante-Nicene period (100–312)\n\n### Scripture\n\nDuring this period, the New Testament writings, including the Gospels, epistles, and apocalyptic texts, were composed and circulated among the early Christian communities. The process of canonization, or the formation of the authoritative Christian scripture, began.\n\n### Early Christian art\n\nAs Christianity spread, early Christian art emerged, characterized by simple, symbolic, and often anonymous works. Catacombs, frescoes, and mosaics depicted scenes from the Old and New Testaments, as well as early Christian martyrs and saints.\n\n### Persecutions and legalization\n\nChristians faced periodic persecutions under Roman emperors, including Nero, Domitian, and Trajan. The Great Persecution (303-313 CE) under Diocletian and Galerius was particularly severe. However, with the Edict of Milan (313 CE), Emperor Constantine I granted toleration to Christianity, marking a significant turning point in its history.\n\n## Spread of Christianity to c. 300 AD\n\n### Inclusivity, women, and exclusivity\n\nEarly Christianity was inclusive, welcoming Jews and Gentiles, slaves and free people, men and women. Women played important roles in the early church, including leadership positions. However, as the church grew, exclusivist tendencies emerged, leading to the marginalization of certain groups.\n\n### Moral practices\n\nEarly Christians emphasized the importance of moral practices, such as charity, fasting, and chastity. They also adopted Jewish practices, such as Sabbath observance and dietary laws. As the church grew, moral teachings became more formalized, particularly in the writings of early church fathers.\n\n# Late antiquity (313–476)\n\n## Conversion of Constantine\n\n### Christianity and the state\n\nConstantine's conversion to Christianity in 312 CE marked a significant shift in the relationship between church and state. The Edict of Milan (313 CE) granted toleration to Christianity, and subsequent emperors, including Constantine, became patrons of the church.\n\n### Christianity and polytheism\n\nAs Christianity spread, it encountered polytheistic cultures, leading to conflicts and syncretism. Christians adapted to local customs and incorporated elements of paganism into their practices.\n\n## Augustine's ethic toward Jews\n\nAugustine of Hippo (354-430 CE) developed a complex and influential theology regarding Jews. While rejecting anti-Jewish violence, he saw Jews as witnesses to the truth of Christianity and advocated for their toleration.\n\n## Developing orthodoxy and heresy\n\nAs Christianity spread, diverse interpretations and controversies emerged. The early church fathers, such as Irenaeus and Tertullian, developed criteria for orthodoxy and confronted heresies, such as Gnosticism and Arianism.\n\n## Church of the East\n\nThe Church of the East, also known as the Nestorian Church, emerged in the 5th century and spread throughout the Middle East and Central Asia. It developed a distinct theology and liturgy, influenced by Persian and Greek traditions.\n\n## Hospitals\n\nChristianity emphasized care for the sick and the poor. The first hospitals, such as the one founded by Basil of Caesarea (c. 370 CE), provided medical care and shelter for the needy.\n\n## Art and literature\n\nLate antiquity saw significant developments in Christian art and literature. The mosaics of Ravenna, the frescoes of the Roman catacombs, and the writings of church fathers like Jerome and Augustine demonstrate the growth of Christian culture.\n\n## Spread and growth of Christianity\n\n### Christianity in the Roman Africa province\n\nChristianity spread rapidly in Roman Africa, particularly in Carthage and other urban centers. The African church produced influential theologians, such as Augustine and Cyprian.\n\n### German Europe, Britain, and Ireland\n\nChristianity spread to German Europe through the missionary work of figures like Boniface and Willibrord. The British Isles and Ireland were also evangelized, with the establishment of monasteries and bishoprics.\n\n### Asia\n\nChristianity spread to Asia through the Silk Road and other trade routes. The Church of the East established a presence in India, China, and other regions.\n\n# Early Middle Ages (476–842)\n\n## Justinian I\n\nJustinian I (527-565 CE) attempted to reunify the Eastern and Western Roman Empires.

The curriculum focused on the liberal arts, Scripture, and patristic writings.\n\n## Law\n\nThe Corpus Juris Civilis, compiled under Justinian, became a foundational text for Western law. Canon law, developed by the church, governed ecclesiastical affairs.\n\n## Monasticism\n\nMonasticism spread throughout Europe, with the establishment of Benedictine, Franciscan, and other orders. Monasteries became centers of learning, art, and spirituality.\n\n## Art\n\nEarly medieval art, characterized by simplicity and symbolism, emerged in various forms, including illuminated manuscripts, mosaics, and metalwork.\n\n## Papal supremacy\n\nThe papacy, led by figures like Gregory the Great (590-604 CE), asserted its authority over the Western church.

The election was triggered by the resignation of Liz Truss as Leader of the Conservative Party and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.\n\n# Background\n\n## Boris Johnson premiership and scandals\n\nBoris Johnson had served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and Leader of the Conservative Party since July 2019. However, his premiership was marred by several scandals, including the COVID-19 pandemic response, the Partygate scandal, and the Chris Pincher scandal. These scandals led to widespread criticism and calls for Johnson's resignation.\n\n## Leadership election to succeed Johnson\n\nIn July 2022, Johnson announced his resignation as Conservative leader, triggering a leadership election. The election saw several candidates, including Liz Truss, Rishi Sunak, and Penny Mordaunt, among others. Truss ultimately won the election, becoming the new Leader of the Conservative Party and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.\n\n## Liz Truss premiership and scandals\n\nTruss's premiership was short-lived and marked by controversy. Her government implemented several unpopular policies, including a mini-budget that sparked economic instability and a fracking policy that was met with widespread opposition. These policies led to a significant decline in Truss's popularity and that of the Conservative Party.\n\n## Calls for Truss's resignation\n\nAs Truss's popularity continued to decline, calls for her resignation grew louder. Several Conservative MPs publicly called for Truss to step down, citing her handling of the economy and her unpopularity with the public.\n\n## Resignations and vote on fracking\n\nIn mid-October, several Conservative MPs resigned from their posts, citing their opposition to Truss's policies. This was followed by a vote on fracking, which saw several Conservative MPs rebel against the government. The vote was seen as a significant defeat for Truss and further eroded her authority.\n\n## Liz Truss resigns\n\nOn October 25, 2022, Liz Truss announced her resignation as Leader of the Conservative Party and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Her resignation triggered a new leadership election, which would take place in the following week.\n\n# Campaign\n\nThe campaign for the October 2022 Conservative Party leadership election was marked by several key issues, including the economy, taxation, and the National Health Service (NHS). Candidates also focused on their leadership style and their ability to unite the party.\n\nSeveral candidates, including Rishi Sunak and Penny Mordaunt, launched their campaigns within hours of Truss's resignation. Other candidates, such as Boris Johnson and Suella Braverman, also considered running but ultimately decided not to.\n\n# Election process\n\nThe election process for the October 2022 Conservative Party leadership election was overseen by the Conservative Party's board and the 1922 Committee. The process involved a series of ballots, with the candidate receiving the fewest votes eliminated in each round.\n\nThe election was open to all Conservative Party members, who were able to vote online or by post. The winner of the election would be announced on October 31, 2022.\n\n# Candidates\n\n## Declared\n\n* Rishi Sunak: Former Chancellor of the Exchequer and runner-up in the July 2022 leadership election.\n* Penny Mordaunt: Leader of the House of Commons and Lord President of the Council.\n* Boris Johnson: Former Prime Minister and Leader of the Conservative Party.\n\n## Withdrawn\n\n* Suella Braverman: Former Home Secretary and Attorney General for England and Wales. Braverman withdrew her candidacy on October 24, 2022, citing her support for Boris Johnson.\n\n## Explored\n\n* Grant Shapps: Former Transport Secretary and Home Secretary. Shapps explored a candidacy but ultimately decided not to run.\n* Kemi Badenoch: Former International Trade Secretary and Equalities Minister. Badenoch explored a candidacy but ultimately decided not to run.\n\n## Declined\n\n* Liz Truss: Former Prime Minister and Leader of the Conservative Party. Truss declined to run in the election, citing her decision to stand down as party leader.\n* Michael Gove: Former Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities. Gove declined to run in the election, citing his support for Rishi Sunak.\n\n# Endorsements\n\nSeveral Conservative MPs and former cabinet members endorsed candidates in the election. Rishi Sunak received endorsements from several high-profile MPs, including Michael Gove and Jeremy Hunt. Penny Mordaunt received endorsements from several MPs, including Andrea Leadsom and Damian Green. Boris Johnson received endorsements from several MPs, including Nadine Dorries and Jacob Rees-Mogg.\n\n# Responses\n\nThe election was met with a range of responses from the public and the media. Several newspapers, including The Times and The Daily Telegraph, endorsed Rishi Sunak as the best candidate to lead the Conservative Party. Other newspapers, such as The Sun and The Daily Mail, endorsed Boris Johnson as the best candidate to lead the party.\n\n# Polling\n\n## Conservative members\n\nPolls of Conservative Party members showed a range of opinions on the candidates. A poll conducted by YouGov in October 2022 found that 55% of Conservative members supported Rishi Sunak, while 24% supported Penny Mordaunt and 15% supported Boris Johnson.\n\n## 2019 Conservative voters\n\nPolls of 2019 Conservative voters also showed a range of opinions on the candidates. A poll conducted by Survation in October 2022 found that 44% of 2019 Conservative voters supported Rishi Sunak, while 26% supported Penny Mordaunt and 21% supported Boris Johnson.\n\n## General population\n\nPolls of the general population showed a range of opinions on the candidates. A poll conducted by Ipsos MORI in October 2022 found that 34% of the public supported Rishi Sunak, while 23% supported Penny Mordaunt and 20% supported Boris Johnson.\n\nThe October 2022 Conservative Party leadership election was a significant event in British politics, marking the second leadership election in just a few months. The election ultimately saw Rishi Sunak emerge as the winner, becoming the new Leader of the Conservative Party and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"October_2022_Conservative_Party_leadership_election\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Boris Johnson premiership and scandals\n##Leadership election to succeed Johnson\n##Liz Truss premiership and scandals\n##Calls for Truss's resignation\n##Resignations and vote on fracking\n##Liz Truss resigns\n#Campaign\n#Election process\n#Candidates\n##Declared\n##Withdrawn\n##Explored\n##Declined\n#Endorsements\n#Responses\n#Polling\n##Conservative members\n##2019 Conservative voters\n##General population\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The novel is a complex and multilayered work that defies easy categorization, blending elements of fiction, nonfiction, art criticism, and philosophical reflection. This article provides an overview of the novel's plot, form, and structure, as well as its history of origins and publication, textual forms, and reception.\n\nPlot\n=====\n\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance is a sprawling narrative that follows a group of young people in Berlin during the 1930s, as they navigate the complexities of art, politics, and identity. The novel's central characters are a group of friends who are drawn to the avant-garde art movement, and who see themselves as part of a broader struggle against fascism and oppression. As they engage with the works of artists such as Bertolt Brecht, Pablo Picasso, and Pablo Neruda, they begin to develop their own aesthetic and philosophical perspectives on the world.\n\nThroughout the novel, Weiss weaves together a wide range of cultural and historical references, from the works of classical Greek tragedians to the writings of Marxist theorists. The result is a rich and densely textured narrative that rewards close reading and reflection.\n\nForm features and structure\n==========================\n\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance is notable for its innovative structure and form. The novel is divided into three volumes, each of which explores a different aspect of the characters' experiences. The first volume focuses on the group's early days in Berlin, as they begin to explore the city's avant-garde art scene. The second volume delves deeper into the characters' individual experiences, as they grapple with the complexities of art, politics, and identity. The third volume brings the narrative full circle, as the characters reflect on their experiences and look to the future.\n\nThroughout the novel, Weiss employs a range of narrative techniques, including stream-of-consciousness passages, dialogue, and philosophical reflection. The result is a work that is both deeply personal and intellectually challenging.\n\nHistory of origins and publication\n================================\n\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance has a complex and fascinating history of origins and publication.\n\n### Beginning\n\nWeiss began working on the novel in the 1960s, during a period of intense personal and artistic transformation. At the time, he was living in Sweden, where he had fled to escape the Nazi regime in Germany. Despite his exile, Weiss remained deeply engaged with the German cultural and intellectual tradition, and he saw the novel as a way of exploring the complexities of art, politics, and identity in the face of oppression.\n\n### Research\n\nWeiss spent several years researching the novel, immersing himself in the works of artists, writers, and philosophers who had shaped the avant-garde movement. He also drew on his own experiences as a young artist in Berlin during the 1930s, as well as his later experiences as a refugee and exile.\n\n### Writer's block\n\nDespite his extensive research and preparation, Weiss struggled with writer's block throughout the 1960s and 1970s. He worked on the novel in fits and starts, often setting it aside for years at a time. It wasn't until the 1980s, when he was in his 60s, that Weiss finally completed the manuscript.\n\n### The third volume\n\nThe third volume of the novel was completed in the late 1980s, just a few years before Weiss's death. This volume brings the narrative full circle, as the characters reflect on their experiences and look to the future.\n\n### Sweden and the GDR\n\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance was first published in Sweden in 1975, where it received critical acclaim. The novel was later translated into German and published in the German Democratic Republic (GDR), where it became a cult classic.\n\n### Other translations\n\nThe novel has since been translated into numerous other languages, including English, French, and Spanish. Despite its complex structure and dense cultural references, The Aesthetics of Resistance has become a beloved and influential work around the world.\n\nTextual forms\n=============\n\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance is a novel that defies easy categorization, blending elements of fiction, nonfiction, art criticism, and philosophical reflection. Throughout the work, Weiss employs a range of textual forms, including stream-of-consciousness passages, dialogue, and philosophical reflection.\n\nArtists and artworks in the novel\n================================\n\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance is notable for its extensive references to artists and artworks. Throughout the novel, Weiss draws on a wide range of cultural and historical references, from the works of classical Greek tragedians to the writings of Marxist theorists.\n\n### Divine Comedy\n\nOne of the novel's central artworks is Dante's Divine Comedy, which serves as a kind of spiritual and philosophical framework for the narrative.\n\n### Central artworks\n\nOther central artworks in the novel include the works of Bertolt Brecht, Pablo Picasso, and Pablo Neruda. These artists serve as models for the characters' own aesthetic and philosophical perspectives on the world.\n\n### Questions\n\nThroughout the novel, Weiss raises a range of questions about the nature of art, politics, and identity. How can art challenge and subvert oppressive systems? What is the relationship between aesthetics and politics?

The UPA was formed in 1942 as the military wing of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN), a radical nationalist organization that sought to establish an independent Ukrainian state. This article will provide an overview of the background, armed resistance, and post-war period of the UPA's anti-Soviet activities.\n\n# Background\n\n## Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists\n\nThe Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) was founded in 1929 by a group of Ukrainian nationalists who sought to establish an independent Ukrainian state. The OUN was a radical organization that advocated for the use of violence to achieve its goals. In the 1930s, the OUN became increasingly influential in Ukraine, particularly among the country's youth.\n\n## Outbreak of the war\n\nIn June 1941, Germany launched Operation Barbarossa, a massive invasion of the Soviet Union. The OUN saw the German invasion as an opportunity to establish an independent Ukrainian state and began to collaborate with the Germans. However, the OUN's collaboration with the Germans was short-lived, as the Nazis had no intention of establishing an independent Ukraine.\n\n## Creation of OUN-B, pogroms, and anti-Soviet uprising\n\nIn 1940, the OUN split into two factions: OUN-M (Melnyk faction) and OUN-B (Bandera faction). The OUN-B faction, led by Stepan Bandera, was more radical and advocated for the use of violence to achieve its goals. In 1941, the OUN-B faction began to organize pogroms against Jews and other minority groups in Ukraine. The OUN-B also launched an anti-Soviet uprising in Ukraine, which was brutally suppressed by the Germans.\n\n## Creation of UPA, anti-German uprising, and extermination of Poles\n\nIn 1942, the OUN-B faction formed the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA), a military organization that sought to establish an independent Ukrainian state. The UPA launched an anti-German uprising in Ukraine, which was also brutally suppressed. The UPA also began to exterminate Poles and other minority groups in Ukraine, which resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people.\n\n# Armed resistance during the war (1944–1945)\n\n## Fights in Volhynia and Podolia (first half of 1944)\n\nIn the first half of 1944, the UPA engaged in a series of battles against the Germans in Volhynia and Podolia. The UPA's military campaign was successful, and the Germans were forced to withdraw from the region.\n\n## After German expulsion from Ukraine\n\n### Battle of Zaliznytsia (28 April 1944)\n\nOn 28 April 1944, the UPA engaged in a battle against the Germans at Zaliznytsia, a village in western Ukraine. The battle was a decisive victory for the UPA, and the Germans were forced to withdraw from the region.\n\n### Battle of Piryatin (19 August 1944)\n\nOn 19 August 1944, the UPA engaged in a battle against the Germans at Piryatin, a village in central Ukraine. The battle was a decisive victory for the UPA, and the Germans were forced to withdraw from the region.\n\n### Battle of Karov (29–30 August 1944)\n\nOn 29-30 August 1944, the UPA engaged in a battle against the Germans at Karov, a village in western Ukraine. The battle was a decisive victory for the UPA, and the Germans were forced to withdraw from the region.\n\n### Battle of Urman village (17 September 1944)\n\nOn 17 September 1944, the UPA engaged in a battle against the Germans at Urman village, a village in western Ukraine. The battle was a decisive victory for the UPA, and the Germans were forced to withdraw from the region.\n\n### Battle of Univ (30 September–1 October 1944)\n\nOn 30 September-1 October 1944, the UPA engaged in a battle against the Germans at Univ, a village in western Ukraine. The battle was a decisive victory for the UPA, and the Germans were forced to withdraw from the region.\n\n### Battle of Leszczawa Górna (28 October 1944)\n\nOn 28 October 1944, the UPA engaged in a battle against the Germans at Leszczawa Górna, a village in western Ukraine. The battle was a decisive victory for the UPA, and the Germans were forced to withdraw from the region.\n\n### Impeding mobilization of Ukrainians to the Red Army\n\nIn 1944, the UPA began to impede the mobilization of Ukrainians to the Red Army. The UPA saw the mobilization as a threat to its goal of establishing an independent Ukrainian state.\n\n### Attacks on cities in 1944\n\nIn 1944, the UPA launched a series of attacks on cities in Ukraine, including Lviv, Rivne, and Lutsk. The attacks were successful, and the UPA was able to establish control over the cities.\n\n### Attacks on the railways\n\nIn 1944, the UPA launched a series of attacks on the railways in Ukraine. The attacks were successful, and the UPA was able to disrupt the Soviet supply lines.\n\n## Fights in 1945\n\n### Elimination of \"Klim Savur\"\n\nIn 1945, the UPA launched a successful campaign to eliminate \"Klim Savur\", a Soviet partisan unit that was operating in Ukraine.\n\n### UPA attacks on cities in 1945\n\nIn 1945, the UPA launched a series of attacks on cities in Ukraine, including Chernivtsi, Khmelnytskyi, and Ternopil. The attacks were successful, and the UPA was able to establish control over the cities.\n\n# Post-war period\n\n## Contacts with the special services of the West\n\nAfter the war, the UPA established contacts with the special services of the West, including the CIA and MI6. The UPA saw the West as a potential ally in its struggle against the Soviet Union.\n\n## Final suppression of the insurgency\n\nIn the late 1940s, the Soviet Union launched a final campaign to suppress the UPA insurgency. The campaign was successful, and the UPA was forced to disband.\n\n# See also\n\n* Ukrainian Insurgent Army\n* Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists\n* Stepan Bandera\n* World War II\n* Soviet Union\n* Ukraine\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is based on a neutral, encyclopedic tone and provides an overview of the anti-Soviet resistance by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army.\n\n# References\n\nNo references are included in this article.\n\n# Further reading\n\n* Armstrong, John A.

The plot involved a group of far-right extremists, including former military personnel and politicians, who sought to establish a new government and impose their own ideology on the country.\n\n# Members\n\nThe group behind the plot included a mix of individuals from various backgrounds, including former military personnel, politicians, and far-right activists. One of the key figures was Heinrich XIII, Prince of Reuss, a member of the House of Reuss and a descendant of the royal family of Reuss. Prince Reuss was reportedly the leader of the group and was said to have been in contact with other far-right organizations and individuals.\n\nOther members of the group included Rüdiger von Pescatore, a former member of the German military, and Birgit Malsack-Winkemann, a former member of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. The group also had connections to other far-right organizations, including the Reichsbürger movement, which rejects the legitimacy of the German government and seeks to establish a new state based on the borders of the German Empire.\n\n# Ideology and Aims\n\nThe ideology of the group behind the plot was rooted in far-right extremism and a rejection of the current German government and its policies. The group sought to establish a new government based on their own ideology, which included a strong emphasis on nationalism, anti-immigration, and anti-European Union sentiment.\n\nThe group's aims were not limited to overthrowing the government, but also included plans to establish a new constitution and impose their own laws and regulations on the country. They also sought to abolish the current federal system and replace it with a more centralized government.\n\nThe group's ideology was also influenced by conspiracy theories, including the belief that the current government is controlled by external forces and that there is a need for a \"national awakening\" to restore German greatness.\n\n# Investigations and Arrests\n\nThe plot was uncovered in December 2022, when German authorities launched a series of raids and arrests across the country. The investigations were led by the Federal Prosecutor's Office and involved several state police forces.\n\nThe authorities seized large quantities of weapons, ammunition, and explosives, as well as documents and communications equipment. The investigation also revealed that the group had been planning to use violence to achieve their goals, including the use of explosives and firearms.\n\nSeveral members of the group were arrested, including Prince Reuss, von Pescatore, and Malsack-Winkemann. The authorities also issued warrants for several other individuals who were believed to be involved in the plot.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## Domestic\n\nThe reaction to the plot was swift and severe, with politicians from across the spectrum condemning the attempt to overthrow the government. Chancellor Olaf Scholz described the plot as a \"threat to democracy\" and promised to take all necessary measures to protect the country.\n\nThe opposition parties also condemned the plot, with the AfD party distancing itself from the individuals involved. The party's leader, Alice Weidel, described the plot as \"unacceptable\" and promised to cooperate fully with the authorities.\n\nThe plot also sparked a wider debate about the rise of far-right extremism in Germany and the need for greater action to prevent such plots in the future.\n\n## International\n\nThe international community also condemned the plot, with several countries expressing their support for the German government. The European Union's High Representative, Josep Borrell, described the plot as a \"threat to European democracy\" and promised to work closely with the German authorities to prevent similar plots in the future.\n\nThe United States also condemned the plot, with the State Department describing it as a \"serious threat to German democracy\". The US authorities also promised to cooperate fully with the German authorities to prevent similar plots in the future.\n\n# See also\n\n* Reichsbürger movement\n* Far-right extremism in Germany\n* 2022 German federal election\n* Alternative for Germany\n* German Empire", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_German_coup_d'état_plot\" following this outline:\n\n#Members\n#Ideology and aims\n#Investigations and arrests\n#Reactions\n##Domestic\n##International\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Their spiritual practices and beliefs are an integral part of their culture and identity. Lakota religion is a complex and multifaceted system that encompasses various aspects of spirituality, morality, and daily life.\n\n# Definition and Classification\n\nLakota religion is often classified as a form of Native American spirituality or indigenous spirituality. It is a nature-based, polytheistic belief system that emphasizes the interconnectedness of all living beings and the natural world. The Lakota people believe in a multitude of spirits, including those associated with animals, plants, and natural elements.\n\n# Beliefs\n\nLakota spirituality is centered on the concept of Wakan, a term that refers to the sacred, the mysterious, and the divine. The Lakota people believe that Wakan is present in all aspects of life and that it is the source of all power and wisdom.\n\n## Wakʽą and Wakʽą Tʽąką\n\nWakʽą is a term that refers to the sacred or the divine. Wakʽą Tʽąką, also known as the Great Mystery, is the ultimate source of all power and wisdom. It is considered the unifying force that binds all living beings and the natural world together.\n\n## Wakʽąpi\n\nWakʽąpi are spirits that inhabit the natural world. They are believed to possess supernatural powers and are often associated with specific animals, plants, and natural elements. The Lakota people believe that Wakʽąpi can be benevolent or malevolent, depending on their intentions and actions.\n\n## Cosmogony\n\nLakota cosmogony is based on the story of creation, which tells of the emergence of the world from a primordial sea. The story varies depending on the specific Lakota tribe, but it often involves the creation of the world by the Great Spirit or Wakʽą Tʽąką.\n\n## Spirit and Afterlife\n\nThe Lakota people believe in an afterlife, where the spirits of the deceased continue to exist in a spiritual realm. They believe that the spirit is immortal and that it will eventually reunite with the ancestors in the afterlife.\n\n## Animism and Kinship\n\nThe Lakota people believe in animism, the idea that all living beings possess a spiritual essence. They believe that humans are part of a larger kinship network that includes animals, plants, and natural elements. This belief system emphasizes the interconnectedness of all living beings and the natural world.\n\n### Šicųpi and wašicu\n\nŠicųpi is a term that refers to the relationship between humans and animals. Wašicu is a term that refers to the relationship between humans and the natural world. Both concepts emphasize the importance of reciprocity and mutual respect between humans and the natural world.\n\n## Cosmology and the Sacred Hoop\n\nLakota cosmology is based on the concept of the sacred hoop, which represents the interconnectedness of all living beings and the natural world. The sacred hoop is often depicted as a circle, symbolizing the unity and wholeness of all creation.\n\n## Morality and Gender Roles\n\nLakota morality is based on the principles of respect, reciprocity, and responsibility. The Lakota people believe that individuals have a responsibility to maintain balance and harmony within themselves and the natural world. Traditional gender roles play an important part in Lakota society, with men and women having distinct roles and responsibilities.\n\n# Practices\n\nLakota spiritual practices are an integral part of daily life. They include various rituals, ceremonies, and prayers that are designed to maintain balance and harmony within the individual and the natural world.\n\n## Prayer and Offerings\n\nThe Lakota people believe in the power of prayer and offerings.

The film is based on the legend of Amleth, which was first recorded in the 12th-century Icelandic Saga of Amleth and later adapted by William Shakespeare into his play Hamlet.\n\n#Plot\n\nThe Northman takes place in 10th-century Iceland and follows the story of Amleth, a Viking prince who seeks revenge for the murder of his father, King Aurvandill War-Raven. The film's plot is a reimagining of the original legend, with Amleth's quest for vengeance driving the narrative. The story explores themes of family, loyalty, and the complexities of the human condition.\n\nAs the film opens, Amleth is a young prince living with his family in a remote Viking village. However, his life is forever changed when his uncle, Fjölnir, murders his father and takes the throne. Amleth escapes and flees to a distant land, where he grows up and trains as a Viking warrior.\n\nYears later, Amleth returns to his homeland, determined to avenge his father's death and reclaim the throne. He assumes a new identity and infiltrates Fjölnir's court, gathering intelligence and waiting for the perfect moment to strike. As Amleth navigates the treacherous world of Viking politics, he must confront his own demons and the true nature of his quest for revenge.\n\n#Cast\n\nThe Northman features an ensemble cast, including:\n\n* Alexander Skarsgård as Amleth, the Viking prince seeking revenge for his father's murder\n* Nicole Kidman as Queen Gudrún, Amleth's mother\n* Claes Bang as Fjölnir, Amleth's uncle and the man who murdered his father\n* Anya Taylor-Joy as Olga of the Birch Forest, a mysterious and powerful sorceress\n* Ethan Hawke as King Aurvandill War-Raven, Amleth's father\n* Willem Dafoe as Heimir the Fool, a court jester with a hidden agenda\n* Gustav Lindh as Thorir, a Viking warrior and Amleth's friend\n* Elliott Rose as Gunnar, a young Viking warrior\n* Ingvar Eggert Sigurðsson as the Sorcerer\n\n#Production\n\n##Development\n\nThe Northman was in development for several years, with Robert Eggers first becoming interested in the legend of Amleth in 2015.

The production team included cinematographer Jarin Blaschke, production designer Craig Lathrop, and costume designer Linda Muir.\n\n##Filming\n\nPrincipal photography began in August 2020 and took place in Northern Ireland and Iceland. The film was shot on location, with the production team building a large Viking village in the mountains of Northern Ireland.\n\nThe cast and crew faced numerous challenges during filming, including harsh weather conditions and the constraints of working during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the production team persevered, and the film was eventually completed in April 2021.\n\n##Post-production\n\nPost-production on The Northman took place in Los Angeles and New York, with Eggers working closely with editor Louise Ford to shape the final cut of the film. The film's sound design and visual effects were created by a team of skilled technicians, who worked to create a rich and immersive cinematic experience.\n\n##Music\n\nThe score for The Northman was composed by Robin Carolan and Sebastian Gainsborough, with additional music by Icelandic musician Björk.

The city's strategic location, situated at the intersection of Highway 401 and Highway 402, has made it an attractive hub for various types of organized crime groups, including motorcycle clubs, street gangs, and syndicates. This article provides an overview of the history and evolution of organized crime in London, highlighting key events, groups, and figures that have shaped the city's underworld.\n\n# Overview\n\nOrganized crime in London has taken many forms over the years, from bank robbery and extortion to narcotics trafficking and murder. The city has been home to numerous organized crime groups, including motorcycle clubs, street gangs, and syndicates. These groups have often clashed with one another, leading to violent conflicts and turf wars. Law enforcement agencies, including the London Police Service and the Ontario Provincial Police, have worked to disrupt and dismantle these organizations, but organized crime remains a persistent problem in the city.\n\n# Early History\n\n## Bank Robbers\n\nOne of the earliest forms of organized crime in London was bank robbery. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, several notorious bank robbers operated in the city, including the infamous \"Black Jack\" McCoy, who robbed numerous banks in the London area during the 1880s. McCoy's exploits were widely publicized, and he became a legendary figure in the city's underworld.\n\n## Motorcycle Clubs\n\nThe 1950s and 1960s saw the emergence of motorcycle clubs in London, including the Annihilators and the Satan's Choice. These clubs were initially formed as social organizations, but they soon became involved in organized crime, including narcotics trafficking and extortion. The motorcycle clubs of London would go on to play a significant role in the city's underworld, often clashing with one another and with law enforcement.\n\n# Major Events\n\n## History of the London Klan\n\nThe Ku Klux Klan (KKK) has a long and dark history in London, dating back to the 1920s. The London chapter of the KKK was one of the most active and notorious in Canada, responsible for numerous acts of violence and intimidation against minority groups. The KKK's presence in London was a major concern for law enforcement, and the organization was eventually dismantled through a series of raids and arrests.\n\n## Ontario Biker War\n\nThe Ontario Biker War was a violent conflict between the Hells Angels and the Outlaws motorcycle clubs that took place in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The conflict began in London and spread to other parts of the province, resulting in numerous murders, bombings, and other violent incidents. The war was eventually brought to an end through a series of police raids and arrests.\n\n## London Conflict\n\nThe London Conflict was a violent turf war between the Hells Angels and the Outlaws that took place in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The conflict began as a dispute over control of the city's narcotics trade, but it soon escalated into a full-blown war. The conflict resulted in numerous murders, bombings, and other violent incidents, and it was eventually brought to an end through a series of police raids and arrests.\n\n# Events by Year\n\n## 1882\n\n* The infamous \"Black Jack\" McCoy robs a bank in London, marking the beginning of a long and notorious career as a bank robber.\n\n## 1920\n\n* The Ku Klux Klan establishes a chapter in London, beginning a long and dark history of racism and violence in the city.\n\n## 1931\n\n* The Annihilators motorcycle club is formed in London, marking the beginning of a long and complex history of motorcycle clubs in the city.\n\n## 1940\n\n* The Satan's Choice motorcycle club is formed in London, becoming one of the most notorious and influential motorcycle clubs in the city.\n\n## 1977\n\n* The Ontario Biker War breaks out, pitting the Hells Angels against the Outlaws in a violent conflict that would last for years.\n\n## 1978\n\n* The Outlaws motorcycle club is banned in Canada, but the club continues to operate in secret.\n\n## 1979\n\n* The Hells Angels establish a chapter in London, becoming one of the most powerful and influential motorcycle clubs in the city.\n\n## 1980\n\n* The Ontario Biker War comes to an end, but the conflict leaves a lasting legacy of violence and intimidation in the city.\n\n## 1985\n\n* The London Police Service launches a major investigation into organized crime in the city, resulting in numerous arrests and convictions.\n\n## 1987\n\n* The Outlaws motorcycle club is re-established in London, marking the beginning of a new era of conflict with the Hells Angels.\n\n## 1989\n\n* The London Conflict breaks out, pitting the Hells Angels against the Outlaws in a violent turf war.\n\n## 1992\n\n* The Hells Angels establish a chapter in the London suburb of Sarnia, marking the beginning of a new era of expansion for the club.\n\n## 1998\n\n* The London Conflict comes to an end, but the conflict leaves a lasting legacy of violence and intimidation in the city.\n\n## 1999\n\n* The Ontario Provincial Police launch a major investigation into organized crime in the province, resulting in numerous arrests and convictions.\n\n## 2000\n\n* The Annihilators motorcycle club is banned in Canada, but the club continues to operate in secret.\n\n## 2001\n\n* The Hells Angels establish a chapter in the London suburb of Woodstock, marking the beginning of a new era of expansion for the club.\n\n## 2002\n\n* The London Motorcycle Show is held, attracting numerous motorcycle clubs and enthusiasts from across the province.\n\n## 2005\n\n* The Outlaws motorcycle club is re-established in London, marking the beginning of a new era of conflict with the Hells Angels.\n\n## 2007\n\n* The London Police Service launches a major investigation into organized crime in the city, resulting in numerous arrests and convictions.\n\n## 2009\n\n* The Hells Angels establish a chapter in the London suburb of St. Thomas, marking the beginning of a new era of expansion for the club.\n\n## 2011\n\n* The Ontario Provincial Police launch a major investigation into organized crime in the province, resulting in numerous arrests and convictions.\n\n## 2012\n\n* The Annihilators motorcycle club is re-established in London, marking the beginning of a new era of conflict with the Hells Angels.\n\n## 2014\n\n* The London Police Service launches a major investigation into organized crime in the city, resulting in numerous arrests and convictions.\n\n## 2015\n\n* The Hells Angels establish a chapter in the London suburb of Ingersoll, marking the beginning of a new era of expansion for the club.\n\n## 2020\n\n* The COVID-19 pandemic has a significant impact on organized crime in London, with many groups forced to adapt to new circumstances.\n\n# Groups, Street Gangs and Crime Syndicates\n\n## Annihilators Motorcycle Club\n\nThe Annihilators motorcycle club is one of the oldest and most influential motorcycle clubs in London.

The election was the seventh to be held since the establishment of the Assembly in 1998, following the Good Friday Agreement. The election was contested by a total of 13 parties, with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), Sinn Féin, the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), and the Alliance Party being the main contenders.\n\n# Background\n\n## Electoral events\n\nThe previous Assembly election was held in 2017, which was called early due to the resignation of the Deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness. The 2017 election saw a significant shift in the balance of power between the unionist and nationalist communities, with Sinn Féin becoming the largest party in the Assembly for the first time. However, the DUP and Sinn Féin failed to form a new executive, leading to a three-year period of direct rule from Westminster.\n\n## Leadership changes\n\nIn the run-up to the 2022 election, there were significant leadership changes within the main parties. In April 2021, Edwin Poots was elected as the new leader of the DUP, replacing Arlene Foster. However, Poots resigned as leader just 21 days later, and was succeeded by Jeffrey Donaldson. In November 2021, Matthew O'Toole was elected as the new leader of the SDLP, replacing Colum Eastwood.\n\n## Northern Ireland Protocol\n\nThe Northern Ireland Protocol, which is part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement, has been a major issue in Northern Irish politics since its implementation in January 2021. The protocol has created checks on goods moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which has led to tensions between the unionist and nationalist communities. The DUP has been strongly opposed to the protocol, while Sinn Féin has supported it as a means of maintaining the integrity of the single market.\n\n## Calls for early election\n\nIn February 2022, the DUP tabled a motion of no confidence in the Assembly, which was narrowly defeated. The party had been calling for an early election, citing the need for a new mandate on the Northern Ireland Protocol. In March 2022, the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Brandon Lewis, announced that the Assembly would be dissolved and an election called for 5 May 2022.\n\n# Candidates\n\nA total of 13 parties contested the 2022 Assembly election, with 239 candidates standing for election. The main parties fielded candidates in all 18 constituencies, while smaller parties and independents contested a smaller number of seats.\n\n# Members not seeking re-election\n\nA total of 19 members of the Assembly did not seek re-election in 2022. These included several high-profile politicians, including the former DUP leader, Arlene Foster, and the former UUP leader, Robin Swann.\n\n# Campaign\n\nThe 2022 Assembly election campaign was dominated by the issue of the Northern Ireland Protocol. The DUP and UUP campaigned on a platform of opposition to the protocol, while Sinn Féin and the SDLP supported its implementation. The Alliance Party campaigned on a platform of pragmatism and compromise, calling for a new approach to the protocol.\n\n# Opinion polls\n\nOpinion polls conducted in the run-up to the election suggested that Sinn Féin would emerge as the largest party, with the DUP and Alliance Party vying for second place. The polls also suggested that the UUP and SDLP would lose seats, while smaller parties such as the Green Party and People Before Profit would gain representation.\n\n# Results\n\n## Distribution of seats by constituency\n\nThe results of the 2022 Assembly election saw Sinn Féin emerge as the largest party, with 27 seats. The DUP won 25 seats, while the Alliance Party won 17 seats. The UUP won 9 seats, while the SDLP won 8 seats. Smaller parties and independents won a total of 12 seats.\n\n## Share of first-preference votes\n\nThe share of first-preference votes was as follows: Sinn Féin (29.0%), DUP (21.3%), Alliance Party (13.5%), UUP (12.2%), SDLP (9.1%), Green Party (1.9%), People Before Profit (1.2%).\n\n## Incumbents defeated\n\nA total of 23 incumbents lost their seats in the 2022 Assembly election. These included several high-profile politicians, including the former DUP MLA, Jonathan Buckley, and the former UUP MLA, Robbie Butler.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe 2022 Assembly election saw a significant shift in the balance of power in Northern Irish politics. Sinn Féin's emergence as the largest party has raised questions about the future of power-sharing in the region. The DUP has refused to form a new executive with Sinn Féin, citing its opposition to the Northern Ireland Protocol. The British government has called for a new approach to the protocol, but it remains unclear what this will entail.\n\n# See also\n\n* Northern Ireland Assembly\n* Good Friday Agreement\n* Northern Ireland Protocol\n* Brexit\n\n# Footnotes\n\n[Insert footnotes]\n\n# References\n\n[Insert references]\n\n# External links\n\n[Insert external links]", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Northern_Ireland_Assembly_election\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Electoral events\n##Leadership changes\n##Northern Ireland Protocol\n##Calls for early election\n#Candidates\n#Members not seeking re-election\n#Campaign\n#Opinion polls\n#Results\n##Distribution of seats by constituency\n##Share of first-preference votes\n##Incumbents defeated\n#Aftermath\n#See also\n#Footnotes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The film is a remake of the 1994 American film Forrest Gump, which was based on Winston Groom's 1986 novel of the same name. Laal Singh Chaddha stars Aamir Khan in the title role, alongside Kareena Kapoor Khan, Naga Chaitanya, and Mona Singh.\n\n# Plot\n\nLaal Singh Chaddha is a heartwarming story of a simple-minded yet kind-hearted man who finds himself in the midst of significant historical events in India. Born with a low IQ, Laal is raised by his single mother, who teaches him to be kind and compassionate towards others. As Laal grows up, he befriends a girl named Rupa and falls in love with her. However, their social differences and Rupa's family's disapproval force them apart.\n\nLaal's life takes a turn when he meets a group of Sikh refugees during the 1947 partition of India. He befriends a young boy named Bala and helps him escape to safety. This chance encounter sets Laal on a journey that takes him through some of the most significant events in Indian history, including the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 and the Emergency of 1975-77.\n\nThroughout his journey, Laal's innocence and good intentions often lead him to the right place at the right time, making him a witness to and sometimes a participant in historical events. Despite facing numerous challenges and setbacks, Laal remains true to his values and continues to spread love and kindness wherever he goes.\n\n# Cast\n\n* Aamir Khan as Laal Singh Chaddha\n* Kareena Kapoor Khan as Rupa D'Souza\n* Naga Chaitanya as Bala\n* Mona Singh as Laal's mother\n* Chaitanya Akkineni as Young Laal\n* Manav Vij as Mohammad Paaji\n* Aaryaa Sharma as Young Rupa\n* Gurpreet Bhangu as Rupa's father\n* Arun Bali as Rupa's grandfather\n* Kamal Tiwari as Havaldar\n* Sagar Saini as Young Bala\n* Abhinay Raj Singh as Young Gurpreet\n\n# Production\n\n## Development\n\nThe idea of remaking Forrest Gump in Hindi was first proposed by Aamir Khan in 2018.

Chandan worked closely with Khan to develop the script and ensure that the story remained true to the original while incorporating Indian elements.\n\n## Casting\n\nAamir Khan was the first and only choice to play the title role. Khan underwent a significant physical transformation to play the character, losing weight and growing his hair long.\n\nKareena Kapoor Khan was cast as Rupa, Laal's love interest. The actress had previously worked with Khan in the 2009 film 3 Idiots.\n\nNaga Chaitanya, a popular Telugu actor, was cast as Bala, a young Sikh refugee who becomes Laal's friend.\n\n## Filming\n\nPrincipal photography for Laal Singh Chaddha began in November 2019 and wrapped up in October 2021. The film was shot on location in various parts of India, including Chandigarh, Punjab, and Rajasthan.\n\nThe film's cinematography was handled by Satyajit Pande, who had previously worked on several Bollywood films. Pande used a combination of digital and film cameras to capture the story's epic scope and emotional depth.\n\n# Music\n\nThe music for Laal Singh Chaddha was composed by Pritam, with lyrics by Amitabh Bhattacharya. The soundtrack features six songs, including the hit single \"Kahani,\" which was released in April 2022.\n\nThe music of Laal Singh Chaddha received widespread critical acclaim, with many praising Pritam's score for its emotional depth and nostalgic value.\n\n# Marketing\n\nThe marketing campaign for Laal Singh Chaddha began in April 2022, with the release of the film's first trailer.

These storms can bring heavy rainfall, strong winds, and coastal flooding, causing significant damage and loss of life. In 2022, tropical cyclones affected various parts of the world, resulting in substantial humanitarian and economic impacts.\n\n# Global Atmospheric and Hydrological Conditions\n\nThe global atmospheric and hydrological conditions in 2022 were influenced by several climate patterns, including the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), and the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO). These climate patterns can modulate the formation and intensity of tropical cyclones. During 2022, the ENSO was in a neutral phase, while the IOD was in a positive phase, and the MJO was active. These conditions contributed to the variability in tropical cyclone activity across different basins.\n\n# Summary\n\nThe 2022 tropical cyclone season was marked by significant activity in several basins. The North Atlantic Ocean saw a below-average season, while the Eastern Pacific Ocean experienced an above-average season. The Western Pacific Ocean was unusually active, with several intense typhoons affecting Japan and the Philippines. The Indian Ocean and the South-West Indian Ocean saw moderate activity, with several cyclones affecting India and Madagascar. The Australian Region and the South Pacific Ocean experienced below-average activity, while the South Atlantic Ocean saw a single named storm.\n\n## North Atlantic Ocean\n\nThe 2022 North Atlantic hurricane season was below average, with 14 named storms, 6 hurricanes, and 2 major hurricanes. The season's activity was suppressed by strong wind shear and dry air. The most notable storm of the season was Hurricane Ian, which caused catastrophic damage in Cuba and Florida.\n\n## Eastern & Central Pacific Ocean\n\nThe 2022 Eastern Pacific hurricane season was above average, with 19 named storms, 10 hurricanes, and 4 major hurricanes. The season's activity was fueled by warm ocean waters and a favorable atmospheric environment.

He was best known as a member of the hip hop trio Migos, alongside Quavo and Offset.\n\n#Early life\n\nTakeoff was born on June 18, 1994, in Lawrenceville, Georgia. He grew up in a low-income household with his mother and siblings. Takeoff's older cousin, Quavo, would later become his bandmate and mentor in the music industry. Takeoff was a quiet and reserved child, but he found solace in music, particularly hip-hop. He began rapping at a young age, influenced by artists such as OutKast and Lil Wayne.\n\n#Career\n\n##2008–2018: Early work with Migos\n\nTakeoff's music career began in 2008, when he formed Migos with Quavo and Offset. The trio started performing at local shows and parties in Atlanta, eventually gaining a small following. In 2012, Migos released their debut mixtape, \"Juug Season.\" The mixtape gained moderate attention, but it was their 2013 single \"Versace\" that brought them mainstream success. The song's catchy hook and Takeoff's verse helped establish Migos as a rising force in hip-hop.\n\nThroughout the 2010s, Migos released several successful mixtapes and albums, including \"Y.R.N. (Young Rich N***as)\" and \"Culture.\" Takeoff's contributions to the group's music were often overlooked, but he played a crucial role in shaping their sound. His laid-back flow and melodic style complemented Quavo's and Offset's more energetic and boastful verses.\n\n##2018–2021: The Last Rocket and later Migos work\n\nIn 2018, Takeoff released his debut solo album, \"The Last Rocket.\" The album received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised Takeoff's growth as an artist. The album featured the hit single \"Last Memory,\" which showcased Takeoff's storytelling ability and emotional depth.\n\nAfter the release of \"The Last Rocket,\" Takeoff continued to work with Migos, releasing the album \"Culture III\" in 2021. The album was a commercial success, but it received mixed reviews from critics. Takeoff's contributions to the album were notable, particularly on the song \"Modern Day,\" which featured a haunting hook and introspective verse.\n\n##2022: Friction within Migos and Only Built for Infinity Links\n\nIn 2022, Migos announced that they would be taking a hiatus to focus on solo projects. However, it soon became clear that the group was experiencing internal tensions. Quavo and Offset released a joint album, \"Only Built for Infinity Links,\" which Takeoff was not involved in. The album's lyrics hinted at a rift between Takeoff and the other members of Migos.\n\n#Legal issues\n\n##Georgia Southern University incident\n\nIn 2015, Takeoff was arrested and charged with possession of a firearm on school property at Georgia Southern University. The incident occurred during a Migos concert, when Takeoff was caught with a gun in his bag. He was later released on bond and pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge.\n\n##Sexual assault allegations\n\nIn 2020, Takeoff was accused of sexual assault by a woman who claimed that he had raped her at a party in Los Angeles. Takeoff denied the allegations, and his lawyer stated that the accusations were \"patently and provably false.\" The case was eventually dropped due to lack of evidence.\n\n#Murder and trial\n\n##Reactions\n\nOn November 1, 2022, Takeoff was shot and killed outside a bowling alley in Houston, Texas. The news of his death sent shockwaves through the music industry, with many artists and fans paying tribute to Takeoff on social media. Quavo and Offset released a joint statement, expressing their grief and sadness at the loss of their friend and bandmate.\n\n##Investigation and legal proceedings\n\nThe investigation into Takeoff's murder is ongoing. Police have arrested several suspects, including a man who was charged with murder in connection with the shooting. The case is still in the early stages of the legal process, and it is unclear what the outcome will be.\n\n##Funeral\n\nTakeoff's funeral was held on November 11, 2022, at the State Farm Arena in Atlanta. The service was attended by thousands of fans, as well as many celebrities and musicians. Quavo and Offset delivered eulogies, praising Takeoff's talent, kindness, and sense of humor.\n\n##Commercial impact\n\nTakeoff's death had a significant impact on the music industry. His album \"The Last Rocket\" re-entered the Billboard 200 chart, and his music saw a surge in streaming activity. Migos' music also experienced a boost in popularity, with many fans rediscovering the group's discography.\n\n#Discography\n\n* \"The Last Rocket\" (2018)\n\n#See also\n\n* Migos\n* Quavo\n* Offset\n* Hip hop\n\n#Notes\n\n* This article is a comprehensive overview of Takeoff's life and career, but it is not exhaustive.
