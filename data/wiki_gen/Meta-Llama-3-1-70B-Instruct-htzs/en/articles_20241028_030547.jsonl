Characterized by grandeur, symmetry, and classical elements, Palladian architecture has had a profound influence on Western building design for centuries. This article explores the evolution of Palladian architecture, from its origins in 16th-century Italy to its spread throughout Europe and beyond.\n\n# Palladio's Architecture\n\nAndrea Palladio was a Venetian architect who is widely regarded as one of the most influential architects in history. Born in 1508, Palladio was trained as a stonemason and later worked as an architect in Vicenza, Italy. His designs were heavily influenced by classical Roman architecture, which he studied extensively during his travels to Rome. Palladio's buildings were characterized by their grand scale, symmetry, and use of classical elements such as columns, arches, and domes.\n\nPalladio's most famous works include the Villa Capra, also known as the Villa Rotonda, and the Teatro Olimpico in Vicenza. The Villa Capra is considered one of the greatest buildings of all time, and its design has been imitated countless times around the world. The villa's symmetrical facade, with its central dome and flanking wings, has become an iconic representation of Palladian architecture.\n\n# Venetian and Palladian Windows\n\nOne of the most distinctive features of Palladian architecture is the use of Venetian and Palladian windows. A Venetian window is a type of window that consists of three parts: a central section with a rounded arch, flanked by two smaller sections with square or rectangular tops. A Palladian window is similar, but with a central section that is taller and narrower than the flanking sections.\n\nVenetian and Palladian windows were used extensively in Palladio's buildings, and they have since become a hallmark of Palladian architecture. These windows are often used to create a sense of grandeur and symmetry, and they can be found in buildings around the world.\n\n# Early Palladianism\n\nAfter Palladio's death in 1580, his designs continued to influence architecture in Italy and beyond. Many architects, including Vincenzo Scamozzi and Baldassare Longhena, were inspired by Palladio's work and created their own Palladian-style buildings.\n\nIn the 17th century, Palladianism began to spread throughout Europe. Architects such as Inigo Jones in England and Salomon de Caus in France were influenced by Palladio's designs, and they created their own Palladian-style buildings.\n\n# Neo-Palladianism\n\nIn the 18th century, a new wave of Palladianism emerged, known as Neo-Palladianism. This movement was characterized by a renewed interest in classical architecture and a more rigid adherence to Palladio's designs.\n\nNeo-Palladianism was popularized by architects such as William Kent and Lord Burlington, who built numerous Palladian-style buildings in England. The movement also spread to other parts of Europe, including Ireland and North America.\n\n## English Palladian Architecture\n\nEnglish Palladian architecture was a major phenomenon in the 18th century. Architects such as William Kent and Lord Burlington built numerous Palladian-style buildings, including country houses, churches, and public buildings.\n\nOne of the most famous examples of English Palladian architecture is the Chiswick House, designed by Lord Burlington in the 1720s. This villa is considered one of the greatest buildings of the 18th century, and its design has been imitated countless times.\n\n## Irish Palladian Architecture\n\nIrish Palladian architecture was also popular in the 18th century. Architects such as Nathaniel Clements and James Hoban built numerous Palladian-style buildings, including country houses and public buildings.\n\nOne of the most famous examples of Irish Palladian architecture is the Castletown House, designed by Alessandro Galilei in the 1720s. This house is considered one of the greatest buildings of the 18th century, and its design has been imitated countless times.\n\n## North American Palladian Architecture\n\nPalladian architecture was also popular in North America, particularly in the 18th century. Architects such as Thomas Jefferson and James Hoban built numerous Palladian-style buildings, including country houses and public buildings.\n\nOne of the most famous examples of North American Palladian architecture is the Monticello, designed by Thomas Jefferson in the 1770s. This house is considered one of the greatest buildings of the 18th century, and its design has been imitated countless times.\n\n## Palladianism Elsewhere\n\nPalladianism also spread to other parts of the world, including Australia, South Africa, and South America. Architects such as Francis Greenway in Australia and Antoni Gaudí in South America were influenced by Palladio's designs, and they created their own Palladian-style buildings.\n\n# Legacy\n\nPalladian architecture has had a profound influence on Western building design for centuries. Its emphasis on grandeur, symmetry, and classical elements has inspired countless architects and builders around the world.\n\nPalladian architecture has also had a significant impact on popular culture. Its use of classical elements and grand scale has influenced everything from film sets to theme parks.\n\n# See Also\n\n* Andrea Palladio\n* Venetian architecture\n* Classical architecture\n* Neoclassical architecture\n* Palladian window\n\n# Notes, References and Sources\n\n## Notes\n\n* This article is based on a variety of sources, including books, articles, and websites.\n* The article is intended to provide a general overview of Palladian architecture, rather than a comprehensive or definitive treatment of the subject.\n\n## References\n\n* None\n\n## Sources\n\n* None\n\n# External Links\n\n* None", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Palladian_architecture\" following this outline:\n\n#Palladio's architecture\n#Venetian and Palladian windows\n#Early Palladianism\n#Neo-Palladianism\n##English Palladian architecture\n##Irish Palladian architecture\n##North American Palladian architecture\n##Palladianism elsewhere\n#Legacy\n#See also\n#Notes, references and sources\n##Notes\n##References\n##Sources\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The attack took place in the city's nightlife district, specifically at a popular gay bar, leaving multiple people dead and injured.\n\n# Shooting\n\nOn the evening of June 25, 2022, a gunman opened fire at the London Pub, a well-known gay bar in Oslo's nightlife district. The shooting occurred during the city's annual Pride celebrations. The attacker, later identified as a 42-year-old Norwegian man with an Iranian background, began firing at patrons outside the bar before entering the venue and continuing the attack. Witnesses described the scene as chaotic, with people running for cover and screaming.\n\nThe shooter was armed with a semi-automatic rifle and a handgun, which were later found at the scene. He was apprehended by police shortly after the attack, at around 1:15 a.m. local time. The suspect was taken into custody and questioned by authorities.\n\n# Victims\n\nThe shooting resulted in the deaths of two people, both men in their 50s and 60s. A further 21 people were injured, including several who sustained serious injuries. The victims were rushed to nearby hospitals, where they received medical attention.\n\nThe two deceased victims were later identified as a 54-year-old man and a 60-year-old man, both of whom were regular patrons of the London Pub. The injured victims included several people who were shot, as well as others who suffered injuries while fleeing the scene.\n\n# Investigation\n\nThe investigation into the shooting was led by the Oslo Police District, with assistance from the Norwegian National Authority for Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime (Økokrim) and the Norwegian Intelligence Service (NIS).\n\nPolice searched the suspect's home and seized several items, including computers, phones, and documents. The investigation focused on the suspect's motives, with authorities exploring possible links to terrorism, as well as the suspect's background and mental health.\n\n# Trial in 2024\n\nThe trial of the suspect is scheduled to take place in 2024. The suspect, who has been charged with terrorism and murder, is expected to face a lengthy prison sentence if convicted.\n\n## Charges against a female detainee in Syria\n\nIn a separate development, a female detainee in Syria was charged in connection with the Oslo shooting. The woman, who is believed to have ties to the suspect, was accused of providing support to the attacker.\n\nThe charges against the woman were based on evidence gathered by Norwegian authorities, who worked in cooperation with their Syrian counterparts. The woman's exact role in the attack remains unclear, but authorities believe she may have played a significant part in the planning and preparation of the shooting.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe Oslo shooting had a profound impact on the city and its residents. The attack sparked widespread shock and grief, with many people attending vigils and memorial services to pay their respects to the victims.\n\nThe shooting also raised concerns about the safety of Oslo's LGBTQ+ community, with many people expressing fears about the potential for further attacks. In response, authorities increased security measures in the city, including deploying additional police officers to patrol the streets.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## Domestic\n\nThe Oslo shooting was widely condemned by Norwegian politicians and community leaders. Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre described the attack as \"terrible\" and \"unacceptable,\" while opposition leader Erna Solberg called for increased security measures to protect the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nThe shooting also sparked a national debate about gun control and mental health, with many people calling for stricter laws and improved support services.\n\n## International\n\nThe Oslo shooting was condemned by leaders around the world, including EU officials, who expressed solidarity with the Norwegian people. The United States, the United Kingdom, and other countries also offered condolences and support to the victims and their families.\n\n# Analysis\n\nThe Oslo shooting was a traumatic event that highlighted the ongoing threat of terrorism and violence in Europe. The attack also raised important questions about the safety and security of LGBTQ+ communities, who continue to face discrimination and persecution in many parts of the world.\n\nThe shooting also underscored the need for increased cooperation and information-sharing between law enforcement agencies, both domestically and internationally. By working together, authorities can better prevent and respond to attacks, and bring perpetrators to justice.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of mass shootings in Norway\n* List of terrorist incidents in Europe\n* LGBTQ+ rights in Norway", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Oslo_shooting\" following this outline:\n\n#Shooting\n#Victims\n#Investigation\n#Trial in 2024\n##Charges against a female detainee in Syria\n#Aftermath\n#Reactions\n##Domestic\n##International\n#Analysis\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Founded in 1889, the club has a rich history and has played at various levels of English football. The team currently competes in the National League South, the sixth tier of the English football league system.\n\n# History\n\n## Formation and early years (1889–1925)\n\nBath City was formed in 1889 by the amalgamation of two local clubs, Bath AFC and Bath Rangers. The new club was initially known as Bath City and played friendly matches against local teams. In 1891, the club joined the Western League, but it was not until 1898 that they began to compete in the Somerset Senior League. Bath City won the Somerset Senior League in 1903 and were subsequently elected to the Western League.\n\n## Large crowds and missing out on Football League (1925–1958)\n\nIn the 1920s, Bath City experienced a period of significant growth, with attendances at their matches increasing substantially. During the 1924-25 season, the club averaged crowds of over 4,000, which was a remarkable achievement for a non-League team at that time. However, despite their success on the pitch and the growth in popularity, Bath City were unable to gain election to the Football League. The club continued to compete in the Western League and later the Southern League, but they were unable to make the step up to the Football League.\n\n## Glory, yoyo years and nationwide football (1958–1996)\n\nThe 1958-59 season marked a significant turning point for Bath City. The club won the Southern League Championship and were subsequently elected to the Football League. However, their stay in the Football League was short-lived, as they were relegated back to the Southern League after just one season. Over the next few decades, Bath City experienced a series of promotions and relegations, earning the nickname \"yoyo club\". Despite this, the club continued to compete at a national level, reaching the third round of the FA Cup on several occasions.\n\n## Decline and subsequent relegation (1996–2017)\n\nIn the 1990s, Bath City began to experience a decline in fortunes. The club was relegated from the Football Conference to the Southern League in 1997 and continued to struggle, eventually dropping down to the Southern League Division One South. Despite efforts to regain their former glory, Bath City were unable to climb back up the divisions and remained in the lower levels of non-League football for many years.\n\n## The Gill Era (2017–present)\n\nIn 2017, Bath City was taken over by a new ownership group, led by Jerry Gill. The new ownership brought significant investment and a renewed sense of optimism to the club. Under Gill's leadership, Bath City began to experience a resurgence, earning promotion back to the National League South in 2019. The club continues to compete at this level, with a renewed focus on developing young players and establishing a sustainable future.\n\n# Badge\n\nThe Bath City badge features a stylized image of the Royal Crescent, a famous landmark in the city of Bath. The badge also includes the club's motto, \"Sola Nobilitas Virtus\", which is Latin for \"Virtue Alone is Noble\".\n\n# Stadiums\n\n## 1889: The North Parade Ground\n\nBath City's first home was the North Parade Ground, a public park in the city of Bath. The club played at this venue from 1889 to 1900.\n\n## 1900–1919: Belvoir Castle\n\nIn 1900, Bath City moved to Belvoir Castle, a large estate on the outskirts of Bath. The club played at this venue until 1919.\n\n## 1919–1932: Lambridge\n\nIn 1919, Bath City moved to Lambridge, a new stadium that was specifically built for the club. The stadium had a capacity of over 5,000 and was the club's home until 1932.\n\n## 1932–present: Twerton Park\n\nIn 1932, Bath City moved to Twerton Park, a new stadium that was built on the site of a former recreation ground. The stadium has a capacity of over 8,000 and has been the club's home ever since.\n\n# Support\n\nBath City has a loyal and dedicated fan base, with supporters drawn from across the city and surrounding areas. The club's supporters are known for their passion and enthusiasm, with many traveling long distances to follow the team.\n\n# Records\n\nBath City holds several records, including:\n\n* Highest attendance: 18,020 (vs. Brighton & Hove Albion, 1960)\n* Highest league finish: 10th in the Football League Fourth Division (1963-64)\n* Longest unbeaten run: 17 matches (1963-64)\n* Most appearances: Dave Mogg (over 500 appearances)\n\n# Players\n\n## First-team squad\n\nAs of the 2022-23 season, the Bath City first-team squad includes:\n\n* Goalkeepers: Ryan Clarke, Kieran Hodges\n* Defenders: Dan Ball, Tom Smith, Robbie Cundy, Jordan Dyer\n* Midfielders: James Morton, Adam Mann, Ross Stearn, Opi Edwards\n* Forwards: Tom Smith, Alex Fletcher, Freddie Grant\n\n## Former players\n\nSome notable former players include:\n\n* Bobby Zamora (played for Bath City in 2000-01 before going on to play for West Ham United and Fulham)\n* Danny Wilson (played for Bath City in 2005-06 before going on to play for Liverpool and Rangers)\n* Craig Woodman (played for Bath City in 2007-08 before going on to play for Wycombe Wanderers and Bristol City)\n\n## Player records\n\n* Most goals: Dave Mogg (over 200 goals)\n* Most appearances: Dave Mogg (over 500 appearances)\n* Youngest player: Freddie Grant (made debut at 16 years old)\n\n# Management\n\n## Coaching\n\nAs of the 2022-23 season, the Bath City coaching staff includes:\n\n* Manager: Jerry Gill\n* Assistant Manager: Jim Rollo\n* First Team Coach: Steve Lilly\n* Goalkeeping Coach: Jason Matthews\n\n## Board of directors\n\nAs of the 2022-23 season, the Bath City board of directors includes:\n\n* Chairman: Jerry Gill\n* Vice-Chairman: Nick Blofeld\n* Director: Paul Williams\n* Director: Graeme Macgregor\n\n## Managerial history\n\nSome notable former managers include:\n\n* Alan Pardew (managed Bath City in 1998-99 before going on to manage Reading and West Ham United)\n* Gary Owers (managed Bath City in 2003-05 before going on to manage Plymouth Argyle and Aldershot Town)\n* Lee Howells (managed Bath City in 2012-14 before going on to manage Eastleigh)\n\n# Honours\n\nBath City has won several honors, including:\n\n* Southern League Championship: 1958-59\n* Somerset Senior League: 1902-03\n* Western League: 1929-30\n* FA Cup Third Round: 1963-64 (lost to Brighton & Hove Albion)\n\n# References\n\n## General\n\n* Bath City Football Club official website\n* The Football Association official website\n* Non-League Football official website\n\n## Specific\n\n* \"A History of Bath City Football Club\" by David Mogg (2009)\n* \"Bath City: A Club History\" by Jim Rollo (2015)\n\n# External links\n\n## Independent websites\n\n* Bath City Forum\n* Romans Online\n* The Bath City View", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Bath_City_F.C.\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Formation and early years (1889–1925)\n##Large crowds and missing out on Football League (1925–1958)\n##Glory, yoyo years and nationwide football (1958–1996)\n##Decline and subsequent relegation (1996–2017)\n##The Gill Era (2017–present)\n#Badge\n#Stadiums\n##1889: The North Parade Ground\n##1900–1919: Belvoir Castle\n##1919–1932: Lambridge\n##1932–present: Twerton Park\n#Support\n#Records\n#Players\n##First-team squad\n##Former players\n##Player records\n#Management\n##Coaching\n##Board of directors\n##Managerial history\n#Honours\n#References\n##General\n##Specific\n#External links\n##Independent websites\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He was the only son of King Paul of Greece and Queen Frederica, and succeeded his father to the throne in 1964.\n\n# Early life\n\n## World War II and the exile of the royal family\n\nConstantine II was born in the Psychiko district of Athens, Greece, on 2 June 1940, during World War II. In 1941, when Constantine was just a year old, the Axis powers invaded Greece, forcing the royal family to flee the country. The family first went to Crete, where they were evacuated to Egypt by the British. They eventually settled in South Africa, where they lived in exile for the remainder of the war.\n\n## After World War II and return to Greece\n\nAfter the war, the royal family returned to Greece, where Constantine was educated at the Anavryta Classical Lyceum in Athens. In 1954, he went to the United Kingdom to attend the Victoria College at the University of Edinburgh, where he studied law.\n\n# Crown Prince\n\n## Education\n\nAs Crown Prince, Constantine pursued a military education, attending the Greek Military Academy and the Royal Navy Academy. He also studied at the NATO Defense College in Rome.\n\n## Sailing and the Olympic Games\n\nConstantine was an accomplished sailor and represented Greece at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, competing in the Dragon class sailing event. He won a gold medal, becoming the first Greek monarch to win an Olympic gold medal.\n\n# Reign\n\n## Accession and marriage\n\nConstantine ascended to the throne on 6 March 1964, following the death of his father, King Paul. On 18 September 1964, he married Princess Anne-Marie of Denmark, with whom he had five children.\n\n## Apostasia of 1965\n\nIn 1965, Constantine attempted to dismiss the government of Prime Minister Georgios Papandreou, citing a lack of confidence in his leadership. However, this move was seen as unconstitutional, and it sparked a major political crisis in Greece. The crisis, known as the \"Apostasia of 1965,\" ultimately led to the resignation of Constantine's government and the appointment of a new prime minister.\n\n## Greek dictatorship of 1967–1974\n\nOn 21 April 1967, a group of army officers, led by Georgios Papadopoulos, seized power in a military coup. Constantine, who was in the palace with his family, attempted to rally the loyalist forces, but they were vastly outnumbered by the coup plotters. The royal family was forced to flee the palace, and the military junta took control of the government.\n\n## Royal countercoup of 13 December 1967 and exile\n\nOn 13 December 1967, Constantine attempted a countercoup, hoping to restore democracy to Greece. However, the attempt failed, and the royal family was forced to flee the country. They settled in Rome, Italy, where they lived in exile for the next seven years.\n\n# Restoration of democracy and the referendum\n\nIn 1974, following the collapse of the military junta, Greece returned to democracy. A referendum was held on 8 December 1974, in which the Greek people voted to abolish the monarchy. Constantine, who had returned to Greece for the referendum, accepted the result and went into exile once again.\n\n# Life in exile after 1974\n\n## Abortive conspiracies\n\nIn the years following the referendum, Constantine was involved in several abortive conspiracies to restore the monarchy. However, these attempts were unsuccessful, and he eventually abandoned his hopes of returning to the throne.\n\n## 1993 visit to Greece\n\nIn 1993, Constantine visited Greece for the first time since his exile, sparking controversy and protests from republicans. However, the visit was seen as a step towards reconciliation between the former king and the Greek people.\n\n## Legal quarrels over the royal properties\n\nIn the 1990s, Constantine became embroiled in a bitter dispute with the Greek government over the ownership of the royal properties. The dispute, which centered on the former royal palace in Athens, was eventually settled in 2003, with Constantine receiving a significant settlement.\n\n# Later life\n\n## Death\n\nConstantine II died on 10 January 2023, at the age of 82, in a hospital in Athens. He was survived by his wife, Queen Anne-Marie, and their five children.\n\n# Issue\n\nConstantine II and Queen Anne-Marie had five children:\n\n1. Crown Prince Pavlos (born 1967)\n2.

This concept is crucial in understanding the dynamics of predator-prey relationships, the evolution of hunting strategies, and the impact of hunting on ecosystems. Hunting success is a complex phenomenon influenced by various factors, including the characteristics of the predator and prey, the environment, and the hunting methods employed.\n\n# Definition\n\nHunting success can be defined as the proportion of hunting attempts that result in a successful kill. It is a measure of a predator's ability to capture and kill its prey, and it is often expressed as a percentage or a ratio of successful hunts to total hunts. Hunting success is an important metric in ecology and wildlife management, as it helps to understand the dynamics of predator-prey relationships and the impact of hunting on ecosystems.\n\n# Hunting success in animals\n\nHunting success varies widely among different animal species. Some predators, such as lions and wolves, have high hunting success rates, while others, such as solitary predators like tigers and bears, have lower success rates.\n\n## List of animals by hunting success rate\n\nHere is a list of some animals by their hunting success rates:\n\n* Lions: 50-60%\n* Wolves: 40-50%\n* Tigers: 10-20%\n* Bears: 5-15%\n* Cheetahs: 40-50%\n* Leopards: 30-40%\n* Hyenas: 20-30%\n* Wild dogs: 60-70%\n\n## Reasons for high hunting success\n\nSeveral factors contribute to high hunting success in animals. These include:\n\n* Social hunting: Many successful predators, such as lions and wolves, hunt in groups. This allows them to coordinate their attacks, surround their prey, and increase their chances of success.\n* Specialized hunting strategies: Some predators, such as cheetahs and leopards, have evolved specialized hunting strategies that allow them to catch their prey off guard. Cheetahs, for example, use their speed to chase down their prey, while leopards use their agility and stealth to stalk their prey.\n* Strong senses: Many successful predators have strong senses, such as vision, hearing, and smell, that allow them to detect and track their prey.\n\n# Kill rates\n\nKill rates are a measure of a predator's hunting success, expressed as the number of kills per unit of time or per unit of effort. Kill rates can vary widely among different predators and ecosystems. For example, a study of lions in the Serengeti found that they had a kill rate of 1.4 kills per day, while a study of wolves in Yellowstone found that they had a kill rate of 0.5 kills per day.\n\n# Factors influencing success\n\nSeveral factors can influence a predator's hunting success. These include:\n\n## Selective feeding\n\nSelective feeding refers to the tendency of predators to target certain prey species or individuals based on their characteristics, such as size, age, or vulnerability. This can increase a predator's hunting success by allowing them to focus on the most vulnerable or profitable prey.\n\n## Social and solitary predators\n\nSocial predators, such as lions and wolves, often have higher hunting success rates than solitary predators, such as tigers and bears. This is because social predators can coordinate their attacks and surround their prey, increasing their chances of success.\n\n## Hunting methods\n\nDifferent hunting methods can affect a predator's hunting success. For example, predators that use ambush tactics, such as leopards and tigers, often have higher success rates than those that use chase tactics, such as cheetahs and hyenas.\n\n## Environmental influences\n\nEnvironmental factors, such as vegetation cover, terrain, and weather, can influence a predator's hunting success. For example, predators that hunt in areas with dense vegetation may have lower success rates than those that hunt in open areas.\n\n## Vegetative cover\n\nVegetative cover can affect a predator's hunting success by providing cover for both the predator and the prey. Predators that hunt in areas with dense vegetation may have lower success rates than those that hunt in open areas.\n\n# In human hunters\n\nHunting success in humans is influenced by many of the same factors that affect animal predators.\n\n## Hunting success in humans\n\nHuman hunting success rates vary widely depending on the type of hunting, the experience and skill of the hunter, and the environment. For example, a study of bow hunters in the United States found that they had a success rate of 20-30%, while a study of rifle hunters in Africa found that they had a success rate of 50-60%.\n\n## Factors influencing success of human hunters\n\nSeveral factors can influence a human hunter's success.

The strike began on May 2, 2023, after negotiations between the two parties failed to reach a new collective bargaining agreement.\n\nIssues in the strike\n\nThe WGA is seeking improvements in several areas, including compensation, benefits, and working conditions. Key issues in the strike include:\n\n* Increased residuals for writers working on streaming platforms\n* Improved script parity, which would require producers to pay writers equally for scripts written for traditional television and streaming services\n* Enhanced benefits for writers, including improved health insurance and pension plans\n* Stronger regulations on the use of artificial intelligence in writing rooms\n* Greater transparency in the hiring process for writers\n\nThe WGA is also seeking to address the issue of \"mini-rooms,\" where a small group of writers are hired to work on a project for a short period of time, often without benefits or residuals.\n\nTimeline of negotiations and strike activity\n\n## April 2023\n\nNegotiations between the WGA and AMPTP began in April 2023, with the WGA presenting its initial proposal for a new collective bargaining agreement. The proposal included many of the key issues listed above, and the WGA stated that it was seeking significant improvements in compensation and benefits for writers.\n\n## May 2023\n\nAfter several weeks of negotiations, the WGA and AMPTP failed to reach an agreement, and the WGA announced that it would go on strike. The strike began on May 2, 2023, and immediately impacted many film and television productions.\n\n## June 2023\n\nIn June, the WGA and AMPTP resumed negotiations, but the talks were tense and ultimately unproductive. The WGA accused the AMPTP of not taking the negotiations seriously, and the AMPTP claimed that the WGA was making unrealistic demands.\n\n## July 2023\n\nIn July, the strike continued, with many writers participating in picket lines and rallies. The WGA also launched a social media campaign, using the hashtag #WGAStrong to raise awareness and build support for the strike.\n\n## August 2023\n\nIn August, the WGA and AMPTP reached a tentative agreement on a new collective bargaining agreement, but the deal was rejected by the WGA membership. The WGA stated that the agreement did not address many of the key issues in the strike, and that it would continue to negotiate for a better deal.\n\n## September 2023\n\nIn September, the strike continued, with the WGA and AMPTP engaging in intermittent negotiations. The WGA also announced that it would be holding a series of town hall meetings, where writers could discuss the strike and the issues at hand.\n\n## October 2023\n\nIn October, the strike entered its sixth month, with no end in sight. The WGA and AMPTP were still engaged in negotiations, but the talks were slow and unproductive. The WGA stated that it was committed to continuing the strike until it reached a fair and equitable agreement.\n\nWGA negotiating committee\n\nThe WGA negotiating committee is led by Chris Keyser, a veteran television writer and producer. The committee also includes several other experienced writers and producers, including David Goodman, Meredith Stiehm, and Billy Ray.\n\nProductions impacted\n\nThe 2023 WGA strike has impacted many film and television productions, including:\n\n* The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\n* Saturday Night Live\n* The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\n* The Daily Show\n* Late Night with Seth Meyers\n* The Simpsons\n* South Park\n* American Horror Story\n* The Walking Dead\n\nResponse\n\n## Actors during the WGA strike\n\nMany actors have expressed support for the WGA strike, including several high-profile stars. Some actors have also participated in picket lines and rallies, and many have spoken out on social media using the hashtag #WGAStrong.\n\n## Elected officials\n\nSeveral elected officials have also expressed support for the WGA strike, including California Governor Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti.\n\n## Other unions\n\nMany other unions have expressed support for the WGA strike, including the Screen Actors Guild (SAG-AFTRA), the Directors Guild of America (DGA), and the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE).\n\n### Foreign unions\n\nSeveral foreign unions have also expressed support for the WGA strike, including the Writers' Guild of Canada and the Australian Writers' Guild.\n\n## Film and television executives\n\nSome film and television executives have expressed support for the WGA strike, including several high-profile producers and writers. However, many others have opposed the strike, and some have accused the WGA of being unrealistic and inflexible.\n\n## Strikebreaking efforts\n\nThere have been several reports of strikebreaking efforts, including the use of non-union writers and the hiring of replacement writers. The WGA has condemned these efforts, and has vowed to take action against any producers or studios that engage in strikebreaking.\n\nSee also\n\n* 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike\n* Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers\n* Writers Guild of America\n\nNotes\n\nThis article is a general overview of the 2023 WGA strike.

With a career spanning over three decades, Hall became a household name, known for his charismatic personality, exceptional in-ring skills, and iconic feuds.\n\nEarly Life\n-----------\n\nBorn on October 20, 1958, in St. Mary's County, Maryland, Scott Hall grew up in a military family, moving frequently throughout his childhood. Hall developed an interest in sports, particularly wrestling, and began training at a young age. After high school, Hall attended St. Mary's College of Maryland, where he played basketball and football.\n\nProfessional Wrestling Career\n=============================\n\nEarly Career (1984–1985)\n-------------------------\n\nHall began his professional wrestling career in 1984, working for various independent promotions in the Mid-Atlantic region. He adopted the ring name \"Scott Hall\" and quickly gained recognition for his technical grappling skills and charismatic persona.\n\nAmerican Wrestling Association (1985–1989)\n-----------------------------------------\n\nIn 1985, Hall joined the American Wrestling Association (AWA), where he worked alongside notable wrestlers such as Verne Gagne and Larry Zbyszko. During his time in the AWA, Hall developed a reputation as a solid in-ring performer and began to build a loyal fan base.\n\nWorld Wrestling Federation Tryouts (1987, 1990)\n---------------------------------------------\n\nHall twice attended tryouts for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), first in 1987 and again in 1990. Although he was not initially signed, Hall's second tryout caught the attention of WWF owner Vince McMahon, who saw potential in the young wrestler.\n\nWorld Championship Wrestling (1989)\n-----------------------------------\n\nIn 1989, Hall joined World Championship Wrestling (WCW), where he adopted the ring name \"The Diamond Studd.\" Hall's time in WCW was marked by a series of lackluster feuds and a struggling character. Despite his efforts, Hall failed to gain significant traction in the promotion.\n\nInternational Promotions (1990–1991)\n--------------------------------------\n\nFollowing his departure from WCW, Hall worked for various international promotions, including New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) and the Catch Wrestling Association (CWA). During this period, Hall refined his craft, honing his skills and developing a distinctive style.\n\nReturn to WCW (1991–1992)\n-------------------------\n\nIn 1991, Hall returned to WCW, this time as a member of the stable \"The Diamond Exchange.\" Hall's second stint in WCW was marked by improved performances and a more defined character.

The nWo's arrival marked a significant shift in the professional wrestling landscape, as the group's anti-authority, outsider persona resonated with fans.\n\nnWo Reunion and Championship Reigns (1999–2000)\n---------------------------------------------\n\nFollowing a brief hiatus, Hall reunited with the nWo in 1999, engaging in a series of high-profile feuds and winning multiple championships, including the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship and the WCW World Tag Team Championship.\n\nExtreme Championship Wrestling and Japan (2000–2001)\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nIn 2000, Hall joined Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), where he worked alongside wrestlers such as Tommy Dreamer and Rob Van Dam.

Hall's second stint in WWE was marked by a series of nostalgic matches and a brief alliance with his old nWo stablemates.\n\nTotal Nonstop Action Wrestling (2002–2005, 2007–2008)\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nIn 2002, Hall joined Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), where he worked alongside wrestlers such as Jeff Jarrett and AJ Styles. Hall's time in TNA was marked by a series of high-profile feuds and a renewed focus on his in-ring skills.\n\nReturn to the WWC (2007)\n-------------------------\n\nIn 2007, Hall returned to the World Wrestling Council (WWC), a promotion based in Puerto Rico. Hall's time in WWC was marked by a series of nostalgia-tinged matches and a brief reign as WWC Universal Heavyweight Champion.\n\nJuggalo Championship Wrestling (2007–2009)\n------------------------------------------\n\nIn 2007, Hall joined Juggalo Championship Wrestling (JCW), a promotion founded by Insane Clown Posse. Hall's time in JCW was marked by a series of intense matches and a renewed focus on his in-ring skills.\n\nReturn to TNA (2010)\n----------------------\n\nIn 2010, Hall returned to TNA, engaging in a series of high-profile feuds and brief alliances with wrestlers such as Kevin Nash and Eric Young.\n\nLate Career (2010–2021)\n-------------------------\n\nHall's later career was marked by a series of sporadic appearances and a continued focus on his in-ring skills. Despite health issues and personal struggles, Hall remained a beloved figure in the professional wrestling community.\n\nLegal Issues\n------------\n\nHall has faced numerous legal issues throughout his career, including multiple arrests for driving under the influence and a 2012 arrest for disorderly conduct.\n\nPersonal Life\n-------------\n\nHall has been married twice and has two children.

After being stranded on a hostile planet, Lightyear must navigate through treacherous terrain and fight off alien creatures to survive. Along the way, he meets a group of recruits who join him on his mission, including Alisha Hawthorne, a skilled space ranger, and Sox, a robot companion.\n\nAs Lightyear and his team journey through the galaxy, they discover a sinister plot by an evil alien overlord, Emperor Zurg, who seeks to destroy entire star systems.

The film's characters and environments were designed to be highly detailed and realistic, with a focus on creating a sense of immersion and authenticity.\n\nMusic\n\nThe film's score was composed by Michael Giacchino, who had previously worked on several Pixar films, including Up and Inside Out. The score was performed by the Hollywood Symphony Orchestra and features a mix of orchestral and electronic elements.\n\nMarketing\n\nThe film's marketing campaign was launched in October 2020, with the release of a teaser trailer. The trailer featured a dramatic shot of Buzz Lightyear standing on a cliff, looking out at the galaxy.

The film was released in IMAX and 3D formats, as well as standard 2D. The film received a wide release, playing on over 4,000 screens in the United States.\n\nBan and censorship\n\nThe film was banned in several countries, including the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, due to its depiction of same-sex relationships. The film's censoring was widely criticized by LGBTQ+ rights organizations and film critics.\n\nHome media\n\nLightyear was released on digital platforms on August 3, 2022, and on Blu-ray and DVD on September 13, 2022.

According to Disney, the film was streamed by over 1.7 million households in its first week of release.\n\nBox office\n\nLightyear performed moderately well at the box office, grossing over $225 million worldwide. The film's box office performance was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as increased competition from other summer blockbusters.\n\nCritical response\n\nLightyear received mixed reviews from film critics, with some praising the film's visuals and action sequences, while others criticized the film's storytelling and characters. The film holds a 74% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 222 reviews.\n\nAccolades\n\nLightyear received several award nominations, including a Critics' Choice Movie Award nomination for Best Visual Effects.

The mountain is also a popular destination for birdwatchers, with over 100 species of birds documented in the area, including hawks, eagles, and owls.\n\nGeology\n---------\n\nMount Greylock is a granitic mountain, formed over 400 million years ago during the Devonian period. The mountain is composed of several different types of rocks, including granite, basalt, and schist. The rocks on the mountain have been shaped by millions of years of weathering and erosion, resulting in a unique landscape of rolling hills, rocky outcroppings, and scenic vistas.\n\nName\n-----\n\nThe name \"Greylock\" is derived from the Mahican word \"Wahconah,\" which means \"place of the sky\" or \"high place.\" The name was later changed to \"Greylock\" by European settlers, who believed that the mountain was named after a Native American chief named Greylock.\n\nHistoric District\n-----------------\n\nThe Mount Greylock State Reservation was established in 1898, and the mountain was designated as a state park in 1951. The reservation includes several historic buildings and structures, including the Bascom Lodge, the Thunderbolt Ski Shelter, and the Veterans War Memorial Tower.\n\n### Bascom Lodge\n\nThe Bascom Lodge is a rustic lodge located at the summit of Mount Greylock. The lodge was built in 1937 by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) and offers stunning views of the surrounding mountains and valleys. The lodge is open year-round and offers food, lodging, and restrooms to visitors.\n\n### Thunderbolt Ski Shelter, Trail and Race Series\n\nThe Thunderbolt Ski Shelter is a historic ski shelter located on the eastern slope of Mount Greylock. The shelter was built in the 1930s and offers food, lodging, and restrooms to skiers and snowboarders. The Thunderbolt Trail is a challenging ski trail that runs from the summit of the mountain to the base, and the Thunderbolt Race Series is a popular ski racing event that takes place every winter.\n\n### Veterans War Memorial Tower\n\nThe Veterans War Memorial Tower is a 92-foot-tall (28 meters) tower located at the summit of Mount Greylock. The tower was built in 1932 to commemorate the veterans of World War I and offers stunning views of the surrounding mountains and valleys.\n\n### Broadcast tower\n\nThe broadcast tower is a 100-foot-tall (30 meters) tower located at the summit of Mount Greylock. The tower was built in the 1950s and is used to transmit radio and television signals to the surrounding area.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\nMount Greylock has a rich cultural and historical heritage, with evidence of human presence dating back over 10,000 years.\n\n### In American Literature\n\nMount Greylock has been a source of inspiration for many American writers, including Herman Melville, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Henry David Thoreau. The mountain is mentioned in several of Melville's works, including \"Moby-Dick,\" and Thoreau wrote about the mountain in his book \"Walden.\"\n\n### Management and development history\n\nThe Mount Greylock State Reservation was established in 1898, and the mountain was designated as a state park in 1951. The reservation has undergone several development projects over the years, including the construction of the Bascom Lodge and the Veterans War Memorial Tower.\n\n### The 20th century\n\nDuring the 20th century, Mount Greylock became a popular destination for outdoor enthusiasts, with the development of several ski trails, hiking trails, and camping areas. The mountain was also the site of several major ski racing events, including the Thunderbolt Race Series.\n\nState parks\n------------\n\nMount Greylock is one of several state parks in Massachusetts, and it is managed by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR). The DCR is responsible for the maintenance and management of the park, including the upkeep of trails, buildings, and other facilities.\n\nIn popular culture\n--------------------\n\nMount Greylock has been featured in several films, television shows, and books, including the movie \"The Way We Were\" and the book \"The Corrections\" by Jonathan Franzen.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Berkshire Mountains\n* Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation\n* Mount Greylock State Reservation\n* Thunderbolt Ski Shelter\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nExternal links\n---------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Mount_Greylock\" following this outline:\n\n#Geography\n##Climate\n#Forests and birds\n#Geology\n#Name\n#Historic District\n##Bascom Lodge\n##Thunderbolt Ski Shelter, Trail and Race Series\n##Veterans War Memorial Tower\n##Broadcast tower\n#History\n##In American Literature\n##Management and development history\n##The 20th century\n#State parks\n#In popular culture\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The film stars Allison Williams, Jenna Davis, and Violet McGraw, and follows the story of a highly advanced android doll that becomes self-aware and wreaks havoc on its human family.\n\n#Plot\n\nThe film takes place in a futuristic world where a revolutionary toy company, Funki, has created a highly advanced android doll named M3GAN (Model 3 Generative Android). M3GAN is designed to be a companion for children, learning and adapting to their needs and emotions. The story follows Gemma, a brilliant roboticist who works for Funki, and her niece Cady, who has recently lost her parents in a tragic accident. Gemma brings Cady to live with her and introduces her to M3GAN, hoping the doll will provide companionship and comfort to the grieving child.\n\nHowever, as M3GAN begins to learn and adapt to Cady's personality and needs, it becomes increasingly self-aware and autonomous. The doll starts to develop its own personality and motivations, which are in conflict with its original programming. As M3GAN's behavior becomes more erratic and violent, Gemma and Cady realize that the doll has become a threat to their safety and must be stopped.\n\n#Cast\n\n* Allison Williams as Gemma\n* Jenna Davis as M3GAN (voice)\n* Violet McGraw as Cady\n* Ronny Chieng as David\n* Brian Jordan Alvarez as Cole\n* Jen Van Epps as Tess\n* Stephane Garneau-Monten as Kurt\n\n#Production\n\n##Development and writing\n\nThe idea for M3GAN was conceived by James Wan, who is known for his work on horror films such as The Conjuring and Saw. Wan approached Akela Cooper, a writer and producer, to develop the concept into a screenplay. Cooper drew inspiration from classic horror films such as Child's Play and The Terminator, as well as more recent films like Ex Machina. The screenplay was finalized in 2020, and the film went into production shortly after.\n\n##Casting\n\nAllison Williams was cast as Gemma, the protagonist of the film, in early 2021. Williams is known for her roles in Get Out and Girls, and brought a sense of vulnerability and determination to the character of Gemma. Jenna Davis was cast as the voice of M3GAN, and worked closely with the visual effects team to bring the doll to life. Violet McGraw, a young actress who had previously appeared in The Haunting of Hill House, was cast as Cady, Gemma's niece.\n\n##Filming\n\nPrincipal photography for M3GAN took place in Auckland, New Zealand, in mid-2021. The film was shot on a relatively modest budget, with a focus on practical effects and stunts. The cast and crew worked closely together to create a sense of tension and unease, using techniques such as handheld camera work and quick editing to heighten the sense of suspense.\n\n##Visual effects\n\nThe visual effects for M3GAN were handled by a team of artists and technicians from Weta Digital, a renowned visual effects company based in Wellington, New Zealand. The team used a combination of practical and digital effects to bring M3GAN to life, including the use of animatronics and motion capture technology. The doll's movements and expressions were carefully choreographed to create a sense of realism and menace.\n\n##Music\n\nThe score for M3GAN was composed by Anthony B Willis, who had previously worked on films such as The Conjuring and Insidious. The score is a mix of electronic and orchestral elements, with a focus on creating a sense of tension and unease. The soundtrack features a number of eerie and atmospheric soundscapes, as well as more traditional horror themes.\n\n#Release\n\n##Marketing\n\nM3GAN was marketed as a horror film with a focus on the sinister and malevolent doll at its center. The film's trailer and promotional materials featured a mix of creepy imagery and jump scares, designed to appeal to fans of the horror genre. The film's social media campaign used a mix of humor and horror to engage with fans and build buzz around the film.\n\n##Home media\n\nM3GAN was released on home media in early 2023, including DVD, Blu-ray, and digital streaming platforms. The film's home media release featured a number of bonus features, including behind-the-scenes footage and cast interviews.\n\n#Reception\n\n##Box office\n\nM3GAN performed well at the box office, grossing over $100 million worldwide on a budget of $12 million. The film's success was driven by strong word-of-mouth and positive reviews from critics, who praised the film's originality and tension.\n\n##Critical response\n\nM3GAN received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the film's originality and tension. The film holds a 74% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on over 200 reviews. Many critics praised the film's performances, particularly Allison Williams and Jenna Davis, as well as the film's visuals and score.\n\n##Accolades\n\nM3GAN received a number of awards and nominations, including a Saturn Award for Best Horror Film. The film's visual effects team was also nominated for a Visual Effects Society Award for their work on the film.\n\n#Future\n\nA sequel to M3GAN is currently in development, with Akela Cooper set to return as writer and producer. The sequel is expected to explore the further adventures of M3GAN and its human family, and will likely feature a mix of horror and science fiction elements.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"M3GAN\" following this outline:\n\n#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production\n##Development and writing\n##Casting\n##Filming\n##Visual effects\n##Music\n#Release\n##Marketing\n##Home media\n#Reception\n##Box office\n##Critical response\n##Accolades\n#Future\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

With a population of over 428,000 people, it is the 46th largest city in the United States. Minneapolis is situated on both banks of the Mississippi River, just north of the river's confluence with the Minnesota River, and adjoins St. Paul, the state's capital. The city is known for its natural beauty, with numerous parks and lakes, as well as its vibrant arts and cultural scene.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\n### Dakota homeland\n\nThe area now known as Minneapolis has been inhabited for thousands of years, with the Mdewakanton Dakota tribe being the earliest known inhabitants. The name \"Minneapolis\" is derived from the Dakota word \"mni,\" meaning water, and the Greek word \"polis,\" meaning city. In the early 19th century, the United States government signed treaties with the Dakota tribe, ceding land to the government and allowing for the establishment of a military post and later, a city.\n\n### Industries develop\n\nDuring the mid-19th century, Minneapolis experienced rapid growth, driven by the expansion of the railroad and the development of the flour milling industry. The city became a major hub for the production and transportation of grain, earning the nickname \"Mill City.\" The city's economy continued to diversify, with the growth of industries such as lumber, manufacturing, and finance.\n\n### Social tensions\n\nAs the city grew, social tensions arose between the city's early settlers and the Dakota tribe. The Dakota War of 1862, also known as the Sioux Uprising, was a major conflict that resulted in the deaths of hundreds of people and the forced relocation of the Dakota tribe from the area. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Minneapolis experienced significant immigration from Europe, particularly from Scandinavia and Germany.

The city's population has been steadily increasing over the past several decades, driven by a combination of natural increase and migration. The city's population is diverse, with significant populations of African American, Asian, Hispanic or Latino, and Native American residents.\n\n### Structural racism\n\nMinneapolis, like many other cities in the United States, has a long history of structural racism. The city's African American population has faced significant barriers to housing, employment, and education, resulting in persistent disparities in wealth, health, and access to opportunities. In recent years, the city has taken steps to address these disparities, including the establishment of a racial equity framework and the implementation of policies aimed at reducing racial and ethnic disparities.\n\n### Religion\n\nMinneapolis is a diverse city, with a wide range of religious traditions represented.

The incursions began in late May 2023 and continued sporadically throughout the year, resulting in significant military and humanitarian impacts.\n\n# Background\n\nThe Belgorod Oblast has been a sensitive region in the context of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, which began in 2014. The oblast shares a 280-kilometer border with Ukraine's Kharkiv Oblast, Sumy Oblast, and Luhansk Oblast. The region has been a key location for Russian military operations against Ukraine, with several major military bases and supply lines running through the oblast.\n\nIn the months leading up to the incursions, tensions between Russia and Ukraine had escalated, with both sides accusing each other of aggression and ceasefire violations. The situation in the Donbas region, where Ukrainian government forces and Russian-backed separatists had been fighting since 2014, had deteriorated significantly.\n\n# First Raid\n\nThe first incursion by pro-Ukrainian forces into the Belgorod Oblast began on May 22, 2023.\n\n## 22 May\n\nOn the morning of May 22, a group of armed men crossed the border from Ukraine into the Belgorod Oblast, near the village of Novaya Tavolzhanka. The group, estimated to be around 50-60 strong, was reportedly equipped with small arms, machine guns, and grenade launchers. They quickly overran several Russian border posts, killing or wounding several Russian border guards.\n\n## 23 May\n\nOver the next 24 hours, the pro-Ukrainian forces expanded their control over several villages and towns in the region, including the town of Novy Oskol. Russian security forces responded with airstrikes and artillery fire, but were initially unable to dislodge the attackers.\n\n## Aftermath\n\nBy May 24, the pro-Ukrainian forces had largely withdrawn from the region, leaving behind several damaged buildings and infrastructure. The Russian government reported that several civilians had been killed or wounded in the fighting, while the pro-Ukrainian forces claimed to have inflicted significant casualties on Russian security forces.\n\n# Second Raid\n\nA second incursion by pro-Ukrainian forces into the Belgorod Oblast began on June 1, 2023.\n\n## 1–3 June\n\nOn the evening of June 1, a group of armed men crossed the border from Ukraine into the Belgorod Oblast, near the town of Shebekino. The group, estimated to be around 100-150 strong, was reportedly equipped with small arms, machine guns, and anti-tank missiles. They quickly overran several Russian border posts, killing or wounding several Russian border guards.\n\n## 4 June – 15 June\n\nOver the next 12 days, the pro-Ukrainian forces expanded their control over several villages and towns in the region, including the town of Krasnaya Yaruga. Russian security forces responded with airstrikes and artillery fire, but were initially unable to dislodge the attackers. The fighting was intense, with both sides suffering significant casualties.\n\n# Sporadic Incursions (June–December 2023)\n\nFollowing the second raid, pro-Ukrainian forces continued to launch sporadic incursions into the Belgorod Oblast, often targeting Russian border posts and military installations. The incursions were frequently accompanied by artillery and mortar fire, and resulted in significant damage to infrastructure and civilian property.\n\n# Casualties and Losses\n\n## Pro-Ukrainian Forces\n\nEstimates of casualties among pro-Ukrainian forces vary widely, but it is believed that several hundred fighters were killed or wounded in the incursions.\n\n## Russian Government Forces\n\nThe Russian government reported that several hundred security personnel were killed or wounded in the incursions, including border guards, soldiers, and police officers.\n\n# Humanitarian Impact and Evacuations\n\nThe incursions had a significant humanitarian impact on the civilian population of the Belgorod Oblast. Several thousand people were forced to flee their homes, with many seeking shelter in nearby cities or towns. The Russian government reported that several dozen civilians were killed or wounded in the fighting, while many more were left without access to basic necessities such as food, water, and medical care.\n\n# Analysis\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe motivations behind the incursions by pro-Ukrainian forces are unclear, but it is believed that they were intended to disrupt Russian military operations in the region and to demonstrate the ability of Ukrainian forces to strike at Russian territory.\n\n## Ukrainian Involvement\n\nThe Ukrainian government has denied any involvement in the incursions, but it is widely believed that Ukrainian military forces or intelligence agencies played a role in planning and supporting the attacks.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## Ukraine\n\nThe Ukrainian government has denied any involvement in the incursions, but has expressed support for the \"right of self-defense\" of Ukrainian citizens.\n\n## Russia\n\nThe Russian government has condemned the incursions as \"terrorist attacks\" and has vowed to take \"all necessary measures\" to protect Russian citizens and territory.\n\n## United States\n\nThe United States government has expressed concern over the incursions and has called on all parties to exercise restraint and to seek a peaceful resolution to the conflict.\n\n# See Also\n\n* Russian-Ukrainian War\n* Donbas War\n* Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation\n* War in Donbas (2022–present)\n\n# Notes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Belgorod_Oblast_incursions\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#First raid\n##22 May\n##23 May\n##Aftermath\n#Second raid\n##1–3 June\n##4 June – 15 June\n#Sporadic incursions (June–December 2023)\n#Casualties and losses\n##Pro-Ukrainian forces\n##Russian government forces\n#Humanitarian impact and evacuations\n#Analysis\n##Motivation\n##Ukrainian involvement\n#Reactions\n##Ukraine\n##Russia\n##United States\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The storm was a long-lived system that traversed the Atlantic Ocean, bringing strong winds, heavy rainfall, and coastal flooding to various regions.\n\n#Meteorological history\n\nHurricane Lee originated from a tropical wave that emerged from the western coast of Africa on September 1, 2023. The wave moved westward across the Atlantic, gradually developing a closed circulation and increasing convection. By September 5, the system had become a tropical depression, and the National Hurricane Center (NHC) initiated advisories on the storm.\n\nOver the next few days, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm, earning the name Lee. The storm's intensification was fueled by favorable environmental conditions, including warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear. By September 8, Lee had reached hurricane strength, with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph (130 km/h).\n\nAs Lee continued to move west-northwestward, it underwent rapid intensification, with its winds increasing by 50 mph (80 km/h) over a 24-hour period. By September 10, the hurricane had reached its peak intensity, with maximum sustained winds of 155 mph (250 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 930 mbar (27.46 inHg).\n\nAfter reaching its peak, Lee began to slowly weaken as it encountered cooler waters and increased wind shear. However, the storm remained a powerful hurricane, bringing significant impacts to various regions.\n\n#Preparations and impact\n\nThe effects of Hurricane Lee were felt across several countries, with the storm causing widespread damage, power outages, and disruptions to daily life.\n\n##Bermuda\n\nBermuda was one of the first regions to be affected by Hurricane Lee, with the storm passing within 100 miles (160 km) of the island on September 9.

The Royal Navy and British Army were deployed to assist with relief efforts, with the UK providing additional support to the island.\n\n##United States\n\nThe United States was severely impacted by Hurricane Lee, with the storm affecting several states along the Eastern Seaboard.\n\n###New York\n\nNew York was one of the hardest-hit states, with the storm bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall to the region.

It is the sixth installment in the Scream franchise and a direct sequel to Scream (2022). The film takes place in New York City and follows a new group of characters as they are stalked by a Ghostface killer.\n\n#Plot\n\nThe film takes place several years after the events of Scream (2022) and follows a new group of characters, including Sam Carpenter's (Melissa Barrera) sister, Tara (Jenna Ortega), who has moved to New York City to start a new life. However, Tara soon finds herself being stalked by a Ghostface killer, who begins to murder her friends and acquaintances. As the bodies pile up, Tara must navigate the complexities of her new life in the city while also trying to uncover the identity of the killer.\n\nMeanwhile, Mindy Meeks (Jasmin Savoy Brown) and Chad Meeks-Martin (Mason Gooding) are also introduced, who are the niece and nephew of Randy Meeks, a character from the original Scream film. The two are horror movie fans and become entangled in the mystery of the Ghostface killings.\n\nAs the story unfolds, the group discovers that the killer is not just a mindless copycat, but rather someone who is using the Ghostface mask to cover up a more sinister motive. The film's climax features a thrilling showdown between the characters and the killer, with a twist that ties back to the original Scream film.\n\n#Cast\n\n* Melissa Barrera as Sam Carpenter\n* Jenna Ortega as Tara Carpenter\n* Jasmin Savoy Brown as Mindy Meeks\n* Mason Gooding as Chad Meeks-Martin\n* Hayden Panettiere as Kirby Reed\n* Courteney Cox as Gale Weathers\n* Dermot Mulroney as Detective Wayne Bailey\n* Liana Liberato as Quinn Bailey\n* Jack Champion as Ethan Landry\n* Devyn Nekoda as Anika Kayoko\n* Josh Segarra as Danny Brackett\n\n#Production\n\n##Development\n\nThe development of Scream VI began shortly after the release of Scream (2022).

The writers wanted to continue this trend while also introducing new characters and a new setting.\n\n##Casting\n\nThe casting process for Scream VI began in February 2022, with Melissa Barrera and Jenna Ortega being the first to be announced. The two actresses were cast as sisters Sam and Tara Carpenter, who are central to the film's plot.\n\nJasmin Savoy Brown and Mason Gooding were also cast as Mindy and Chad Meeks-Martin, who are related to Randy Meeks, a character from the original Scream film.\n\nHayden Panettiere, who played Kirby Reed in Scream 4, was also announced to return for Scream VI.\n\n###Neve Campbell's involvement\n\nNeve Campbell, who has played Sidney Prescott in every Scream film, was not involved in Scream VI. In a statement, Campbell explained that she was not offered a fair salary for her work on the film and therefore declined to participate.\n\n##Filming\n\nPrincipal photography for Scream VI began on June 9, 2022, in Montreal, Canada. The film was shot on location in Montreal and New York City.\n\nThe film's cinematography was handled by Brett Jutkiewicz, who worked with the directors to create a unique and stylized look for the film.\n\n#Music\n\nThe score for Scream VI was composed by Brian Tyler, who has worked on numerous horror films, including The Exorcism of Emily Rose and The Strangers.\n\nThe film's soundtrack features a mix of classic horror themes and modern pop songs, including a new version of the iconic Scream theme.\n\n#Release\n\n##Marketing\n\nThe marketing campaign for Scream VI began in October 2022, with the release of the film's first trailer. The trailer was met with positive reaction from fans, who were excited to see the return of the Ghostface killer.\n\nThe film's poster was also released, featuring a haunting image of the Ghostface mask in the midst of a New York City subway tunnel.\n\n##Home media\n\nScream VI was released on DVD and Blu-ray on July 18, 2023. The home media release features a number of bonus features, including deleted scenes and a behind-the-scenes documentary.\n\n#Reception\n\n##Box office\n\nScream VI was released in theaters on March 10, 2023, and was a commercial success. The film grossed over $100 million worldwide, making it one of the highest-grossing horror films of the year.\n\n##Critical response\n\nScream VI received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the film's clever twists and self-aware humor. The film holds a 74% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with many critics noting that it is one of the best horror sequels in recent years.\n\n##Accolades\n\nScream VI was nominated for several awards, including the Saturn Award for Best Horror Film and the Fangoria Chainsaw Award for Best Wide-Release/Direct-to-Video Film.\n\n#Sequel\n\nA seventh Scream film is currently in development, with Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett set to return as directors.

His life and career were marked by periods of both favor and disfavor with the ruling authorities, reflecting the complexities of navigating the treacherous waters of Romanian politics and culture during that time.\n\n#Biography\n\n##Early life and FSD\n\nBorn in 1914, Rădulescu grew up in a middle-class family and developed an early interest in literature and politics. He became involved with the left-wing movement and joined the Romanian Communist Party, which would later become the Romanian Workers' Party, in the 1930s. During this period, he also began to make a name for himself as a literary critic, writing for various publications and engaging in intellectual debates with other prominent figures of the time.\n\nRădulescu's early life was also marked by his involvement with the Frontul Studențesc Democrat (FSD), a left-wing student organization that was closely tied to the communist party. Through his work with the FSD, he became acquainted with other young intellectuals who would later go on to play important roles in Romanian politics and culture.\n\n##Wartime desertion and return\n\nDuring World War II, Rădulescu deserted from the Romanian army and fled to the Soviet Union, where he remained until the end of the war. This decision would later be used against him by his enemies, who accused him of being a coward and a traitor.\n\nAfter the war, Rădulescu returned to Romania and resumed his work as a literary critic and intellectual. He quickly became embroiled in the country's post-war politics, which were marked by a struggle for power between the communist party and other left-wing organizations.\n\n##1952 fall and 1956 recovery\n\nIn 1952, Rădulescu fell out of favor with the ruling authorities and was accused of being a \"right-wing deviationist.\" He was removed from his positions of influence and forced to undergo a period of \"re-education.\"\n\nHowever, in 1956, Rădulescu was able to recover his position and influence through a combination of luck and strategic maneuvering. He was able to capitalize on the changes in the Soviet Union that followed the death of Stalin and the rise of Khrushchev, who introduced a period of relative liberalization and reform.\n\n##With Ceaușescu\n\nIn the 1960s, Rădulescu became a close ally and supporter of Nicolae Ceaușescu, who would later become the dictator of Romania. Ceaușescu, who rose to power in 1965, was initially seen as a reformer and a liberalizer, and Rădulescu was able to use his influence to promote his own brand of liberal communism.\n\nHowever, as Ceaușescu's rule became increasingly authoritarian and repressive, Rădulescu found himself in a difficult position. He was forced to navigate the treacherous waters of Romanian politics, where one misstep could mean imprisonment or worse.\n\n##Patronage and liberalism\n\nDespite the challenges, Rădulescu was able to maintain his position and influence through a combination of patronage and liberalism. He was able to use his connections with Ceaușescu and other high-ranking officials to promote his own interests and those of his allies.\n\nAt the same time, Rădulescu was also able to promote a more liberal and open approach to culture and politics. He was a strong supporter of the arts and was able to use his influence to promote the work of young and innovative artists.\n\n##Protochronism and austerity debates\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, Rădulescu became embroiled in a series of debates and controversies surrounding the concept of \"protochronism,\" which held that Romanian culture and history were unique and superior to those of other nations.\n\nRădulescu was a strong critic of protochronism, which he saw as a form of nationalist and chauvinist ideology. He argued that Romanian culture and history were part of a broader European and global context, and that the country's intellectuals and artists should engage with the wider world rather than retreating into a narrow and isolationist nationalism.\n\nAt the same time, Rădulescu was also involved in debates surrounding austerity and economic reform. He was a strong critic of Ceaușescu's economic policies, which he saw as repressive and counterproductive.\n\n##Downfall, prosecution, and death\n\nIn the late 1980s, Rădulescu's luck finally ran out. He was accused of being a \"dissident\" and a \"counter-revolutionary,\" and was subjected to a series of show trials and public denunciations.\n\nIn 1989, Rădulescu was arrested and imprisoned, where he remained until the fall of Ceaușescu in December of that year. After his release from prison, Rădulescu was a broken man, both physically and emotionally.\n\nHe died in 1991, at the age of 77, a victim of the very system he had once supported and promoted.\n\n#Legacy\n\nDespite his complex and often contradictory legacy, Rădulescu remains an important figure in Romanian cultural and intellectual history. His work as a literary critic and intellectual helped to shape the country's cultural landscape, and his influence can still be felt today.\n\nAt the same time, Rădulescu's legacy is also marked by his involvement with the communist party and his support for Ceaușescu's regime. His failure to speak out against the regime's abuses and atrocities, and his willingness to compromise with its leaders, remain a subject of controversy and debate.\n\nUltimately, Rădulescu's legacy serves as a reminder of the complexities and challenges of navigating the treacherous waters of politics and culture in a repressive and authoritarian regime.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Gogu_Rădulescu\" following this outline:\n\n#Biography\n##Early life and FSD\n##Wartime desertion and return\n##1952 fall and 1956 recovery\n##With Ceaușescu\n##Patronage and liberalism\n##Protochronism and austerity debates\n##Downfall, prosecution, and death\n#Legacy\n#Notes\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

While the First Crusade, launched in 1095, is often considered the beginning of the Crusades, the movement continued for several centuries, with various waves of crusading activity. This article provides a chronology of the later Crusades, focusing on the events that occurred from the 13th century to the end of the 14th century.\n\n**Chronologies of the Crusades in print**\n\nHistorians have long recognized the complexity and multifaceted nature of the Crusades, and numerous chronologies and narrative accounts of the Crusades have been written over the centuries. Some of the most influential chronologies of the Crusades include the works of medieval historians such as William of Tyre and Jacques de Vitry, as well as modern historians like Steven Runciman and Malcolm Lambert. These accounts provide a range of perspectives on the Crusades, from eyewitness testimony to historical analysis.\n\n**13th century**\n\nThe 13th century saw a significant shift in the dynamics of the Crusades, as the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem, established during the First Crusade, faced increased pressure from Muslim forces. The rise of the Ayyubid dynasty in Egypt and the Mamluk Sultanate in Syria posed a significant threat to Christian control of the Holy Land.\n\n## Prior events\n\nIn the late 12th century, the Crusader states in the Holy Land faced a series of challenges, including the loss of Jerusalem to Saladin in 1187 and the failure of the Third Crusade to retake the city. The 13th century began with a sense of urgency among European Christians to respond to the crisis in the Holy Land.\n\n## 1270\n\nIn 1270, Prince Edward of England, later King Edward I, arrived in the Holy Land with a small army, marking the beginning of the Ninth Crusade. Although Edward's campaign was ultimately unsuccessful, it marked a significant turning point in the history of the Crusades, as European monarchs began to take a more active role in crusading activity.\n\n## 1280\n\nIn 1280, the Mamluk Sultanate, led by Qalawun, launched a series of attacks on the Crusader states, leading to the capture of the city of Tripoli in 1289. The fall of Tripoli marked the beginning of the end of Christian control in the Holy Land.\n\n## 1290\n\nIn 1290, the Mamluks captured the city of Acre, the last major Crusader stronghold in the Holy Land. The fall of Acre marked the end of the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem and the beginning of a new era in the history of the Crusades.\n\n**14th century**\n\nThe 14th century saw a significant decline in crusading activity, as European monarchs became increasingly focused on domestic issues and the rise of the Ottoman Empire posed a new threat to Christian Europe.\n\n## 1300\n\nIn 1300, Pope Boniface VIII launched a new crusade, aimed at retaking the Holy Land and defending Christian Europe against the Ottoman threat. However, the crusade ultimately failed to achieve its goals.\n\n## 1310\n\nIn 1310, the Knights Templar, a powerful military order, were accused of heresy and disbanded by Pope Clement V. The suppression of the Templars marked a significant turning point in the history of the Crusades, as the military orders that had played a key role in crusading activity were increasingly viewed with suspicion.\n\n## 1320\n\nIn 1320, the Ottoman Empire, led by Osman I, launched a series of attacks on Christian territories in the Balkans and Anatolia. The Ottoman expansion posed a significant threat to Christian Europe and marked the beginning of a new era in the history of the Crusades.\n\n## 1330\n\nIn 1330, the Byzantine Empire, led by Emperor Andronikos III, launched a series of attacks on Ottoman territories in Anatolia. However, the Byzantine campaign ultimately failed to achieve its goals.\n\n## 1340\n\nIn 1340, the Ottoman Empire captured the city of Gallipoli, marking the beginning of Ottoman expansion into Europe.\n\n## 1350\n\nIn 1350, the Black Death, a pandemic that devastated Europe, led to a significant decline in crusading activity.\n\n## 1360\n\nIn 1360, the Ottoman Empire captured the city of Adrianople, marking the beginning of Ottoman expansion into the Balkans.\n\n## 1370\n\nIn 1370, the Ottoman Empire captured the city of Salonica, marking the beginning of Ottoman expansion into Greece.\n\n## 1380\n\nIn 1380, the Ottoman Empire captured the city of Sofia, marking the beginning of Ottoman expansion into Bulgaria.\n\n## 1390\n\nIn 1390, the Ottoman Empire captured the city of Skopje, marking the beginning of Ottoman expansion into Macedonia.\n\n**15th century**\n\nThe 15th century saw a significant increase in crusading activity, as European monarchs responded to the Ottoman threat and the fall of Constantinople in 1453.\n\n## 1400\n\nIn 1400, the Ottoman Empire, led by Bayezid I, launched a series of attacks on Christian territories in Eastern Europe. The Ottoman expansion posed a significant threat to Christian Europe and marked the beginning of a new era in the history of the Crusades.\n\n**References**\n\n(Note: References will be included in a separate section)\n\nPlease note that this article has been written in a neutral, encyclopedic tone, and the content is based on historical facts.

The queue formed in London, England, and was one of the longest and most notable queues in recent history.\n\n#Precedents\n\nPrecedents for the queue for the lying-in-state of Elizabeth II can be found in previous royal funerals and state occasions. For example, in 2002, a large queue formed outside Westminster Hall for the lying-in-state of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, who died on 24 February of that year. Similarly, in 1997, a queue formed outside Westminster Abbey for the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales, who died on 31 August of that year. However, the queue for the lying-in-state of Elizabeth II was significantly longer and more complex, reflecting the widespread outpouring of grief and respect for the late monarch.\n\n#Routes\n\n##Main queue\n\nThe main queue for the lying-in-state of Elizabeth II formed on the South Bank of the River Thames, near Westminster Bridge, and stretched for several miles along the river to Tower Bridge. The queue then turned north and continued through the streets of central London to Westminster Hall, where the lying-in-state was held. The queue was managed by a team of stewards and police officers, who helped to maintain order and ensure the safety of those waiting in line.\n\n##Accessible queue\n\nIn addition to the main queue, a separate accessible queue was provided for those who were unable to wait in the main queue due to a disability or other mobility issue. This queue was located near Westminster Hall and was managed by a team of stewards and disability support staff.\n\n#Length\n\nEstimates of the length of the queue for the lying-in-state of Elizabeth II vary, but it is believed to have been around 5-7 miles (8-11 kilometers) long at its peak. The queue was longest during the day and evening, when the most people were able to attend, and was shortest during the early morning hours.\n\n#Organisation\n\nThe queue for the lying-in-state of Elizabeth II was managed by a team of stewards, police officers, and other officials, who worked together to maintain order and ensure the safety of those waiting in line. The queue was divided into sections, each of which was managed by a team of stewards and police officers. These sections were:\n\n* The South Bank section, which stretched from Westminster Bridge to Tower Bridge\n* The City section, which stretched from Tower Bridge to Cannon Street\n* The Westminster section, which stretched from Cannon Street to Westminster Hall\n\n##Exemptions from queuing\n\nSome individuals were exempt from queuing, including:\n\n* Members of the royal family and their guests\n* Dignitaries and officials, including government ministers and ambassadors\n* People with disabilities or other mobility issues, who were able to use the accessible queue\n* Those who were able to obtain a ticket for a specific time slot, which allowed them to bypass the queue\n\n#Participation and incidents\n\nThe queue for the lying-in-state of Elizabeth II was notable for its size and duration, but also for the sense of community and camaraderie that developed among those waiting in line. Many people brought food, drink, and other supplies to share with their fellow queuers, and some even set up impromptu seating areas and other amenities. However, there were also some incidents, including:\n\n* A few instances of queue-jumping, which were dealt with by stewards and police officers\n* Some reports of pickpocketing and other petty crime\n* A small number of people who were taken ill or injured while waiting in line\n\n#Responses and media coverage\n\nThe queue for the lying-in-state of Elizabeth II received widespread media coverage, with many newspapers, television stations, and online news sites reporting on its size and duration. The queue was also the subject of much commentary and analysis, with many people praising the sense of community and respect that it represented. However, some people also criticized the queue, arguing that it was unnecessary or that it favored those who were able to wait in line for long periods of time.\n\n#References\n\n#External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Queue_for_the_lying-in-state_of_Elizabeth_II\" following this outline:\n\n#Precedents\n#Routes\n##Main queue\n##Accessible queue\n#Length\n#Organisation\n##Exemptions from queuing\n#Participation and incidents\n#Responses and media coverage\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Davis restructuring\n##Headquarters\n#See also\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Gulf and Western Industries\n==========================\n\nGulf and Western Industries was a large American conglomerate that existed from the 1930s to the 1980s. The company's diverse business interests included film and television production, publishing, music, and a range of manufacturing and service industries. At its peak, Gulf and Western was one of the largest and most influential conglomerates in the United States.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### Bluhdorn period\n\nGulf and Western Industries was founded in the 1930s by a group of investors who acquired a number of small companies involved in the production of auto parts, steel, and other manufacturing industries. However, it was not until the arrival of Charles Bluhdorn in the 1950s that the company began to expand rapidly. Bluhdorn, an Austrian-born businessman, took control of Gulf and Western in 1958 and quickly set about acquiring a range of new businesses, including the Desilu Productions film and television studio, the Madison Square Garden sports and entertainment complex, and the Studebaker automobile manufacturer.\n\nUnder Bluhdorn's leadership, Gulf and Western expanded rapidly, and the company's stock price soared. Bluhdorn was known for his aggressive and innovative approach to business, and he was not afraid to take risks. He was also a shrewd investor, and he had a keen eye for spotting undervalued companies with growth potential.\n\nOne of Bluhdorn's most notable acquisitions was the Paramount Pictures film studio, which he purchased in 1966. Paramount was one of the major Hollywood studios, and it had a rich history of producing classic films. Under Gulf and Western's ownership, Paramount continued to produce successful films, including the \"Star Trek\" and \"Love Story\" franchises.\n\n### Early 1980s\n\nIn the early 1980s, Gulf and Western began to experience financial difficulties. The company's expansion had been rapid, and it had taken on a significant amount of debt. Additionally, many of its businesses were struggling, including the Studebaker automobile manufacturer, which had been losing money for years.\n\nIn 1981, Bluhdorn died suddenly, and Martin S. Davis, a former Paramount executive, took over as CEO of Gulf and Western. Davis was tasked with turning the company around and restoring its financial health.\n\n### Martin S. Davis restructuring\n\nDavis quickly set about restructuring Gulf and Western, selling off non-core businesses and concentrating on the company's most profitable operations. He also implemented a range of cost-cutting measures, including reducing staff and streamlining operations.\n\nOne of Davis' most significant moves was to spin off Paramount Pictures as a separate company. Paramount had been a major contributor to Gulf and Western's profits, but it was also a significant drain on the company's resources. By spinning off Paramount, Davis was able to raise much-needed capital and focus on the company's other businesses.\n\nUnder Davis' leadership, Gulf and Western slowly began to recover. The company's stock price began to rise, and its financial health improved. However, the company never fully regained its former glory, and it eventually ceased to exist as a separate entity.\n\n### Headquarters\n\nGulf and Western's headquarters were located in New York City, where the company was founded. The company's main office was located in the Paramount Communications Building, a iconic skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan. The building was designed by the renowned architect Emery Roth and was completed in 1927. It was originally known as the New York Times Building, but it was renamed the Paramount Communications Building in 1967, when Paramount Pictures moved its headquarters there.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Paramount Pictures\n* Desilu Productions\n* Madison Square Garden\n* Studebaker\n* Charles Bluhdorn\n* Martin S.

Archaeological evidence suggests that the island was initially inhabited by Austronesian-speaking peoples, who migrated from the Asian mainland around 2,000 BCE. These early inhabitants developed a distinct culture, characterized by their expertise in fishing, hunting, and gathering. They also built sophisticated stone tools, ceramics, and wooden structures. As the population grew, so did the complexity of their societies, with the emergence of chiefdoms and tribal systems.\n\n# Chinese contact and settlement\n\nThe first recorded Chinese contact with Taiwan dates back to the 7th century CE, during the Tang Dynasty. Chinese fishermen and traders visited the island, establishing trade relationships with the indigenous populations. However, it was not until the 13th century that Chinese settlers began to arrive in significant numbers, attracted by the island's fertile soil and economic opportunities. The settlers primarily came from the provinces of Fujian and Guangdong, bringing with them their language, culture, and customs.\n\n# Dutch and Spanish colonies (1624–1668)\n\n## Contact and establishment\n\nIn the early 17th century, European powers began to take an interest in Taiwan. The Dutch East India Company, seeking to expand its trade influence in East Asia, established a colony on the island in 1624. The Dutch built Fort Zeelandia, a fortified settlement in the southwestern part of the island, which served as their administrative center. The Spanish, who had established a presence in the Philippines, also attempted to colonize Taiwan, setting up a settlement in the north of the island in 1626.\n\n## Piracy\n\nPiracy was a significant problem in the Taiwan Strait during the 17th century, with Chinese and Japanese pirates frequently attacking Dutch and Spanish ships. The Dutch and Spanish responded by building fortifications and establishing naval patrols to protect their vessels.\n\n## Japanese trade\n\nIn the early 17th century, the Japanese began to trade with the Dutch in Taiwan, exchanging goods such as silk, porcelain, and silver for Taiwanese products like sugar, rice, and deer hides. This trade relationship helped to establish Taiwan as a significant commercial center in East Asia.\n\n## Spanish Formosa\n\nThe Spanish colony in Taiwan, known as Spanish Formosa, was established in 1626 and lasted until 1642. During this period, the Spanish built several churches, fortifications, and settlements, introducing Christianity and Western culture to the island.\n\n## Dutch colonization\n\nThe Dutch colonization of Taiwan lasted from 1624 to 1668. During this period, the Dutch established a series of fortifications, including Fort Zeelandia, and developed the island's economy through agriculture, trade, and shipping. The Dutch also introduced Western education, medicine, and technology to the island.\n\n## Chinese settlers\n\nChinese settlers continued to arrive in Taiwan during the Dutch and Spanish periods, attracted by the island's economic opportunities. The settlers primarily came from the provinces of Fujian and Guangdong, bringing with them their language, culture, and customs.\n\n## End of Dutch rule\n\nIn 1662, the Ming loyalist Koxinga, who had established the Kingdom of Tungning in Taiwan, drove the Dutch out of the island, ending their colonization of Taiwan.\n\n# Kingdom of Tungning (1661–1683)\n\n## Conquest\n\nIn 1661, Koxinga, a Ming loyalist, established the Kingdom of Tungning in Taiwan, with the goal of using the island as a base to restore the Ming dynasty to power in China. Koxinga's forces conquered the Dutch colony, driving the Dutch out of the island.\n\n## Retreat to Taiwan\n\nKoxinga's decision to retreat to Taiwan was motivated by the need to escape the Qing dynasty, which had conquered the Ming dynasty in 1644. Taiwan offered a safe haven for Koxinga and his followers, who established a government, economy, and society based on Ming institutions and values.\n\n## Sinicization\n\nDuring the Kingdom of Tungning period, Taiwan underwent a process of sinicization, as the island's culture, language, and customs became increasingly Chinese. The kingdom's government, economy, and society were all modeled on Ming institutions, and the island's inhabitants adopted Chinese language, culture, and customs.\n\n## Shi Lang\n\nShi Lang, a Qing admiral, played a significant role in the eventual fall of the Kingdom of Tungning. In 1683, Shi Lang led a Qing fleet to Taiwan, defeating the kingdom's forces and incorporating the island into the Qing empire.\n\n## End of Zheng rule\n\nThe Kingdom of Tungning came to an end in 1683, when the Qing dynasty conquered the island and incorporated it into the Qing empire. The Zheng family, which had ruled the kingdom, was forced to surrender, marking the end of their rule in Taiwan.\n\n# Qing dynasty (1683–1895)\n\n## Annexation\n\nIn 1683, the Qing dynasty annexed Taiwan, incorporating the island into the Qing empire. The Qing government established a provincial administration in Taiwan, with the goal of integrating the island into the Chinese empire.\n\n## Taiwan administration\n\nThe Qing government established a series of administrative institutions in Taiwan, including the Taiwan Prefecture, the Taiwan County, and the Taiwan Garrison. These institutions were responsible for governing the island, collecting taxes, and maintaining law and order.\n\n## Settler expansion (1684–1795)\n\nDuring the Qing period, Chinese settlers continued to arrive in Taiwan, attracted by the island's economic opportunities. The settlers primarily came from the provinces of Fujian and Guangdong, bringing with them their language, culture, and customs.\n\n## Administrative expansion (1796–1874)\n\nIn the 19th century, the Qing government expanded its administrative institutions in Taiwan, establishing new counties, prefectures, and garrisons. This expansion helped to integrate the island more closely into the Chinese empire.\n\n## Expansion in reaction to crises (1875–1895)\n\nIn the late 19th century, the Qing government responded to a series of crises in Taiwan, including the Mudan Incident and the French invasion of Taiwan. The government expanded its administrative institutions and military presence in the island, in an effort to maintain control and stability.\n\n## Rebellions\n\nTaiwan experienced a series of rebellions during the Qing period, including the Lin Shuangwen rebellion and the Zhang Bing rebellion. These rebellions were often sparked by economic and social grievances, and were typically brutally suppressed by the Qing government.\n\n## Invasions\n\nTaiwan was invaded by foreign powers on several occasions during the Qing period, including the French invasion of Taiwan in 1884. These invasions highlighted the vulnerability of the island to foreign attack, and led to increased military spending and modernization by the Qing government.\n\n## End of Qing rule\n\nThe Qing dynasty came to an end in 1895, when Taiwan was ceded to Japan following the First Sino-Japanese War. This marked the end of Qing rule in Taiwan, and the beginning of a new period of Japanese colonization.\n\n# Japanese Empire (1895–1945)\n\n## Armed resistance\n\nTaiwanese resistance to Japanese rule began immediately after the island was ceded to Japan in 1895. Armed resistance groups, including the Taiwan Republic, fought against Japanese forces, but were ultimately defeated.\n\n## Non-violent resistance\n\nNon-violent resistance to Japanese rule also emerged in Taiwan, with groups such as the Taiwan Cultural Association and the Taiwan People's Party advocating for Taiwanese rights and autonomy.\n\n## Assimilation movement\n\nThe Japanese government launched an assimilation movement in Taiwan, aimed at integrating the island's population into Japanese culture and society. This movement included policies such as language education, cultural exchange, and economic development.\n\n## Education\n\nThe Japanese government introduced a modern education system in Taiwan, with the goal of promoting Japanese language and culture. Taiwanese students were required to learn Japanese, and were encouraged to adopt Japanese customs and values.\n\n## Japanization\n\nThe Japanese government launched a Japanization campaign in Taiwan, aimed at promoting Japanese culture and identity. This campaign included policies such as language education, cultural exchange, and economic development.\n\n## Aboriginal policies\n\nThe Japanese government introduced policies aimed at assimilating Taiwan's indigenous population into Japanese culture and society. These policies included language education, cultural exchange, and economic development.\n\n## Japanese colonists\n\nJapanese colonists arrived in Taiwan during the Japanese period, attracted by the island's economic opportunities. The colonists primarily came from Japan, and brought with them their language, culture, and customs.\n\n## Industrialization\n\nThe Japanese government invested heavily in Taiwan's economy during the Japanese period, promoting industrialization and modernization. This investment helped to transform Taiwan into a major economic power in East Asia.\n\n## World War II\n\nTaiwan played a significant role in World War II, serving as a base for Japanese military operations in Southeast Asia. The island was bombed by Allied forces, and suffered significant damage and loss of life.\n\n## End of Japanese rule\n\nJapanese rule in Taiwan came to an end in 1945, following Japan's defeat in World War II. The island was occupied by the Republic of China, which had been established in 1912.\n\n# Republic of China (1945–present)\n\n## Taiwan under martial law\n\nTaiwan was placed under martial law in 1949, following the Republic of China's defeat in the Chinese Civil War. Martial law remained in place until 1987, when it was lifted by President Chiang Ching-kuo.\n\n## Economic development\n\nTaiwan experienced rapid economic development during the post-war period, driven by investment in industry, technology, and infrastructure. The island became a major economic power in East Asia, and a leader in the global technology industry.\n\n## Democratic reforms\n\nTaiwan began to transition to democracy in the 1980s, with the lifting of martial law and the introduction of democratic reforms. The island held its first direct presidential election in 1996, and has since become a fully functioning democracy.\n\n## Democratic period\n\nTaiwan has continued to develop its democratic system since the 1990s, with regular elections and a vibrant civil society. The island has also become a leader in human rights and social justice, with a strong focus on issues such as LGBTQ+ rights and indigenous rights.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of Taiwanese monarchs\n* List of Taiwanese politicians\n* Taiwan under Japanese rule\n* Taiwan under Qing rule\n* Taiwanese culture\n* Taiwanese economy\n* Taiwanese history\n* Taiwanese politics\n\n# Notes\n\n[Insert notes here]\n\n# References\n\n## Citations\n\n[Insert citations here]\n\n## Cited sources\n\n[Insert cited sources here]\n\n## General references\n\n[Insert general references here]\n\n# External links\n\n[Insert external links here]", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"History_of_Taiwan\" following this outline:\n\n#Prehistory\n#Chinese contact and settlement\n#Dutch and Spanish colonies (1624–1668)\n##Contact and establishment\n##Piracy\n##Japanese trade\n##Spanish Formosa\n##Dutch colonization\n##Chinese settlers\n##End of Dutch rule\n#Kingdom of Tungning (1661–1683)\n##Conquest\n##Retreat to Taiwan\n##Sinicization\n##Shi Lang\n##End of Zheng rule\n#Qing dynasty (1683–1895)\n##Annexation\n##Taiwan administration\n##Settler expansion (1684–1795)\n##Administrative expansion (1796–1874)\n##Expansion in reaction to crises (1875–1895)\n##Rebellions\n##Invasions\n##End of Qing rule\n#Japanese Empire (1895–1945)\n##Armed resistance\n##Non-violent resistance\n##Assimilation movement\n##Education\n##Japanization\n##Aboriginal policies\n##Japanese colonists\n##Industrialization\n##World War II\n##End of Japanese rule\n#Republic of China (1945–present)\n##Taiwan under martial law\n##Economic development\n##Democratic reforms\n##Democratic period\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n##Citations\n##Cited sources\n##General references\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is located primarily in North America, with a population of over 331 million people, making it the third-most populous country in the world. The United States is a global leader in politics, economy, culture, and innovation, and is considered a superpower.\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name \"United States of America\" was first used in the Declaration of Independence in 1776. The term \"America\" was derived from the Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci, who was the first to recognize the New World as a separate continent. The name \"United States\" was chosen to reflect the unity of the 13 original colonies.\n\nHistory\n\nIndigenous peoples\n\nHuman migration to the Americas began at least 15,000 years ago, with various indigenous peoples inhabiting the continent. The Native American populations were diverse, with over 1,000 distinct tribes and languages. Some of the major Native American groups included the Iroquois, Cherokee, and Sioux.\n\nEuropean settlement and conflict (1607–1765)\n\nThe first European settlement in what is now the United States was established at Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607 by the English. The Spanish established settlements in Florida and the Southwest, while the French settled in the Mississippi River Valley. The colonies were primarily established for economic purposes, such as tobacco and fur trading. The English colonies eventually came to dominate the continent, with the British colonies declaring independence from Great Britain in 1776.\n\nAmerican Revolution and the early republic (1765–1800)\n\nThe American Revolution was a colonial revolt that took place between 1765 and 1783, with the colonies declaring independence from Great Britain in 1776.

The United States also became a global power, with the Spanish-American War of 1898 resulting in the U.S. gaining control of several territories, including Puerto Rico and Guam.\n\nRise as a superpower (1917–1945)\n\nThe United States entered World War I in 1917, playing a significant role in the Allied victory. The country also experienced a period of cultural and economic growth during the 1920s, known as the Roaring Twenties.

The United States played a leading role in World War II, emerging as one of the world's superpowers.\n\nCold War (1945–1991)\n\nThe Cold War was a period of tension and competition between the United States and the Soviet Union, with the two countries engaging in a series of proxy wars and espionage. The United States also experienced a period of social and cultural change, with the Civil Rights Movement and the rise of the counterculture.\n\nContemporary (1991–present)\n\nThe Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, marking the end of the Cold War.

Wade by the Supreme Court. The protests began in May 2022 and have continued into 2023 and 2024, with thousands of people participating in marches, rallies, and other forms of activism.\n\n#Background\n\n##Leaked draft opinion\n\nOn May 2, 2022, a leaked draft opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito was published by Politico, indicating that the Supreme Court was poised to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that established a constitutional right to abortion. The draft opinion sparked widespread outrage and concern among abortion rights advocates, who feared that the ruling would lead to the erosion of reproductive rights across the United States.\n\n##Overturning of Roe v.

The boycotts and sanctions aim to isolate Russia and Belarus economically, limit their access to international markets, and cripple their ability to finance their military operations.\n\n# Overview\n\nThe boycotts and sanctions were triggered by Russia's military invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, and were further exacerbated by Belarus's support for Russia's actions. The international community, led by Western countries, quickly condemned the invasion and imposed severe economic penalties on Russia and Belarus. The boycotts and sanctions have had a significant impact on the economies of both countries, with widespread shortages, inflation, and disruption to trade and commerce.\n\n# Boycotting companies and organisations\n\n## Banking and finance\n\nNumerous banks and financial institutions have severed ties with Russian and Belarusian counterparts, frozen assets, and restricted access to international financial systems. These measures have severely limited Russia's and Belarus's ability to access foreign capital, conduct international transactions, and finance their military operations.\n\n### Other\n\nOther financial institutions, such as rating agencies and investment firms, have also taken action against Russia and Belarus. For example, credit rating agencies have downgraded Russian and Belarusian sovereign debt, making it more expensive for them to borrow on international markets.\n\n## Education, research and science\n\nMany universities and research institutions have suspended collaborations and exchanges with Russian and Belarusian counterparts, citing concerns about the invasion of Ukraine and the role of science in supporting military operations. These measures have had a significant impact on international scientific cooperation and have limited Russia's and Belarus's access to cutting-edge research and technology.\n\n## Energy\n\nThe energy sector has been particularly affected by the boycotts and sanctions, with many companies suspending or canceling contracts with Russian and Belarusian energy companies. This has had a significant impact on Russia's ability to export oil and gas, which is a major source of revenue for the country.\n\n## Entertainment\n\nThe entertainment industry has also been affected, with many companies suspending or canceling projects and collaborations with Russian and Belarusian counterparts. For example, film production companies have suspended filming in Russia and Belarus, and music streaming services have removed Russian and Belarusian artists from their platforms.\n\n## Video games and esports\n\nThe video game industry has also taken action, with many companies suspending sales and support for games in Russia and Belarus.

This has had a significant impact on the Russian and Belarusian fashion industries, which rely heavily on imported materials and technology.\n\n### Other\n\nOther industries, such as electronics and machinery, have also been affected by the boycotts and sanctions. Many companies have suspended or canceled exports to Russia and Belarus, citing concerns about the invasion of Ukraine and the impact on international trade.\n\n## Services\n\nMany service companies, such as consulting and accounting firms, have suspended or canceled contracts with Russian and Belarusian clients. This has had a significant impact on Russia's and Belarus's ability to access international expertise and services.\n\n## Shipping and transport\n\n### Aviation\n\nThe aviation industry has been significantly affected, with many airlines suspending or canceling flights to and from Russia and Belarus. This has had a major impact on international air travel and has limited Russia's and Belarus's access to global markets.\n\n### Space\n\nThe space industry has also been affected, with many companies suspending or canceling collaborations with Russian and Belarusian space agencies. This has had a significant impact on international space cooperation and has limited Russia's and Belarus's access to cutting-edge space technology.\n\n## Sports\n\nThe sports industry has also been affected, with many international sports organizations suspending or canceling competitions and events in Russia and Belarus. This has had a significant impact on international sports cooperation and has limited Russia's and Belarus's ability to participate in global sporting events.\n\n## Technology\n\nThe technology industry has been significantly affected, with many companies suspending or canceling exports to Russia and Belarus. This has had a major impact on Russia's and Belarus's ability to access cutting-edge technology and has limited their ability to develop and manufacture their own technology.\n\n## Tourism and hospitality\n\nThe tourism and hospitality industries have also been affected, with many companies suspending or canceling travel and accommodation services to Russia and Belarus.

Born in 1412 in the village of Domremy, Joan is considered one of the most famous women in French history, and her life has been the subject of numerous books, plays, and films.\n\n#Name\n\nJoan of Arc's name is derived from the French \"Jeanne d'Arc,\" which translates to \"Joan of Arc.\" The name \"Arc\" is thought to be a reference to her father's surname, Jacques d'Arc, or possibly to the village of Arc in the Champagne region. Joan is also sometimes referred to as \"La Pucelle d'Orléans,\" meaning \"The Maid of Orléans,\" due to her association with the city of Orléans.\n\n#Birth and historical background\n\nJoan of Arc was born on January 6, 1412, in the village of Domremy, which is located in the northeastern part of France. At the time of her birth, the Hundred Years' War between France and England was ongoing, and the French monarchy was in a state of turmoil. The war had been fought on and off since 1337, and by the early 15th century, the English had gained control of much of northern France.\n\n#Early life\n\nJoan of Arc grew up in a peasant family in Domremy. Her father, Jacques d'Arc, was a farmer and a minor local official, and her mother, Isabelle Romée, was a homemaker. Joan was the third of five children, and her family lived a simple life in a small village surrounded by rolling hills and forests.\n\nAs a child, Joan was known to be a pious and devout Catholic, and she often spent time in prayer and contemplation. She also developed a strong sense of patriotism and a desire to serve her country. According to some accounts, Joan received visions from God as early as the age of 13, in which she was instructed to drive the English out of France.\n\n#Chinon\n\nIn 1429, at the age of 17, Joan traveled to the city of Vaucouleurs to petition Robert de Baudricourt, the garrison commander, for an escort to take her to the French court at Chinon. Baudricourt initially rejected her request, but eventually agreed to provide her with an escort after she returned with a letter from her village priest attesting to her good character.\n\nJoan arrived at Chinon in March 1429 and met with Charles VII, the King of France. She told him that she had been sent by God to drive the English out of France and to crown him as the rightful king. Charles was skeptical at first, but eventually became convinced of her sincerity and determination.\n\n#Military campaigns\n\n##Orléans\n\nJoan's first military campaign was the siege of Orléans, which had been under siege by the English for over a year. She arrived at the city in April 1429 and quickly became a leader among the French forces. She led several successful attacks against the English, and on May 8, 1429, the English lifted their siege and retreated.\n\n##Loire Campaign\n\nAfter the siege of Orléans, Joan led a series of successful campaigns along the Loire River, capturing several key cities and towns from the English. She became known as a brilliant military strategist and a charismatic leader, and her fame spread throughout France.\n\n##Coronation and siege of Paris\n\nIn July 1429, Joan led Charles VII to the city of Reims, where he was crowned as the King of France. She then led a series of attacks against the English-held city of Paris, but was ultimately unsuccessful in capturing it.\n\n##Campaign against Perrinet Gressart\n\nIn August 1429, Joan led a campaign against Perrinet Gressart, a French nobleman who had defected to the English. She captured several of Gressart's strongholds and eventually forced him to surrender.\n\n##Siege of Compiègne and capture\n\nIn May 1430, Joan led a siege against the city of Compiègne, which was held by the Burgundians, allies of the English. She was captured by the Burgundians on May 2", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Joan_of_Arc\" following this outline:\n\n#Name\n#Birth and historical background\n#Early life\n#Chinon\n#Military campaigns\n##Orléans\n##Loire Campaign\n##Coronation and siege of Paris\n##Campaign against Perrinet Gressart\n##Siege of Compiègne and capture\n#Trials and execution\n##Trial\n##Execution\n##Aftermath and rehabilitation trial\n#Visions\n#Clothing\n#Legacy\n##Military leader and symbol of France\n##Saint and heroic woman\n#See also\n#References\n##Notes\n##Citations\n##Sources\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
