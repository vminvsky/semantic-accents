This concept is crucial in understanding the dynamics of predator-prey relationships, ecosystems, and the evolution of hunting strategies. In this article, we will explore the concept of hunting success in animals, its various factors, and its implications for human hunters.\n\n# Definition\n\nHunting success is typically measured as the proportion of hunts that result in a successful kill. This can be expressed as a percentage or a ratio of successful hunts to total hunts. Hunting success can also be influenced by factors such as the type of prey, the hunting method, and environmental conditions.\n\n# Hunting success in animals\n\nHunting success varies widely among different animal species. Some predators, such as lions and wolves, are highly successful hunters, while others, such as hyenas and vultures, scavenge for food.\n\n## List of animals by hunting success rate\n\nHere is a list of some animal species and their estimated hunting success rates:\n\n* Lion: 50-60%\n* Wolf: 30-40%\n* Leopard: 30-50%\n* Cheetah: 40-50%\n* Hyena: 10-20%\n* Vulture: 0-10% (scavenger)\n* Great White Shark: 50-60%\n* Saltwater Crocodile: 50-70%\n* Polar Bear: 20-30%\n\n## Reasons for high hunting success\n\nThere are several reasons why some animals have high hunting success rates. These include:\n\n* Adaptation to their environment: Animals that are well-adapted to their environment, such as lions in the savannah, have a higher hunting success rate.\n* Social hunting: Some animals, such as wolves and lions, hunt in groups, which increases their hunting success rate.\n* Specialized hunting techniques: Animals that have specialized hunting techniques, such as cheetahs and great white sharks, have a higher hunting success rate.\n* Strong senses: Animals with strong senses, such as vision and hearing, have a higher hunting success rate.\n\n# Kill rates\n\nKill rates refer to the number of kills made by a predator per unit of time. Kill rates can be influenced by various factors, including the type of prey, the hunting method, and environmental conditions.\n\n# Factors influencing success\n\nThere are several factors that influence hunting success in animals. These include:\n\n## Selective feeding\n\nSelective feeding refers to the tendency of predators to select certain prey over others. This can be influenced by factors such as the nutritional value of the prey, the risk of hunting, and the competition for food.\n\n## Social and solitary predators\n\nSocial predators, such as wolves and lions, have a higher hunting success rate than solitary predators, such as leopards and cheetahs. This is because social predators can work together to hunt and kill prey.\n\n## Hunting methods\n\nDifferent hunting methods can influence hunting success. For example, ambush predators, such as lions and leopards, have a higher hunting success rate than active hunters, such as cheetahs and hyenas.\n\n## Environmental influences\n\nEnvironmental factors, such as vegetation, terrain, and weather, can influence hunting success. For example, predators that hunt in dense vegetation, such as leopards and tigers, have a higher hunting success rate than those that hunt in open terrain, such as cheetahs and hyenas.\n\n## Vegetative cover\n\nVegetative cover can influence hunting success by providing cover for predators and prey. Predators that hunt in areas with dense vegetation, such as leopards and tigers, have a higher hunting success rate than those that hunt in open terrain, such as cheetahs and hyenas.\n\n# In human hunters\n\nHunting success in humans is influenced by various factors, including the type of prey, the hunting method, and environmental conditions.\n\n## Hunting success in humans\n\nHunting success in humans can be measured as the proportion of hunts that result in a successful kill. This can be expressed as a percentage or a ratio of successful hunts to total hunts.\n\n## Factors influencing success of human hunters\n\nThere are several factors that influence hunting success in humans. These include:\n\n* Experience and skill: Human hunters with more experience and skill have a higher hunting success rate.\n* Equipment and technology: Human hunters with access to advanced equipment and technology, such as firearms and GPS, have a higher hunting success rate.\n* Environmental conditions: Human hunters who hunt in areas with favorable environmental conditions, such as abundant prey and suitable terrain, have a higher hunting success rate.\n\n## Hunting types and methods\n\nThere are several types of hunting, including:\n\n* Big game hunting: Hunting large game animals, such as deer and elk.\n* Small game hunting: Hunting small game animals, such as rabbits and birds.\n* Trophy hunting: Hunting for the purpose of obtaining a trophy, such as a large antler or a rare species.\n\n## Impact\n\nHunting success in humans can have a significant impact on ecosystems and wildlife populations. Overhunting can lead to population declines and even extinctions, while sustainable hunting practices can help maintain healthy wildlife populations.\n\n# See also\n\n* Predator-prey relationships\n* Ecosystems\n* Conservation biology\n* Wildlife management\n* Hunting regulations", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Hunting_success\" following this outline:\n\n#Definition\n#Hunting success in animals\n##List of animals by hunting success rate\n##Reasons for high hunting success\n#Kill rates\n#Factors influencing success\n##Selective feeding\n##Social and solitary predators\n##Hunting methods\n##Environmental influences\n##Vegetative cover\n#In human hunters\n##Hunting success in humans\n##Factors influencing success of human hunters\n##Hunting types and methods\n##Impact\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The strike began on May 2, 2023, and affected the film and television industry in the United States.\n\nIssues in the strike\n\nThe strike was called in response to several key issues, including compensation for writers working in the streaming industry, residuals for reuse of content on streaming platforms, and the role of artificial intelligence in content creation. The WGA sought increased residuals for writers working on streaming platforms, such as Netflix and Hulu, as well as improved compensation for writers working on low-budget films and television shows. Additionally, the WGA sought to establish clear guidelines for the use of artificial intelligence in content creation, including the use of AI-generated dialogue and characters.\n\nTimeline of negotiations and strike activity\n\n## April 2023\n\nNegotiations between the WGA and AMPTP began in April 2023, with the WGA presenting its initial proposals for changes to the collective bargaining agreement. The WGA sought significant increases in residuals for writers working on streaming platforms, as well as improved compensation for writers working on low-budget films and television shows.\n\n## May 2023\n\nAfter several weeks of negotiations, the WGA and AMPTP were unable to reach an agreement, and the WGA announced that it would go on strike on May 2, 2023. The strike affected film and television production in the United States, with many writers refusing to work on projects until a new agreement was reached.\n\n## June 2023\n\nIn June 2023, the WGA and AMPTP resumed negotiations, but progress was slow. The WGA continued to push for significant increases in residuals and improved compensation for writers working on low-budget films and television shows.\n\n## July 2023\n\nIn July 2023, the WGA and AMPTP reached a tentative agreement on several key issues, including residuals for reuse of content on streaming platforms. However, the agreement did not address the issue of compensation for writers working on low-budget films and television shows.\n\n## August 2023\n\nIn August 2023, the WGA and AMPTP continued to negotiate, but the talks were stalled over the issue of compensation for writers working on low-budget films and television shows.\n\n## September 2023\n\nIn September 2023, the WGA and AMPTP reached a tentative agreement on compensation for writers working on low-budget films and television shows. The agreement provided for significant increases in pay for writers working on these types of projects.\n\n## October 2023\n\nIn October 2023, the WGA membership voted to approve the tentative agreement, and the strike was officially ended.\n\nWGA negotiating committee\n\nThe WGA negotiating committee was led by David Young, the executive director of the WGA, East, and Chris Keyser, the co-chair of the WGA negotiating committee. Other members of the committee included writers and producers who were experienced in labor negotiations.\n\nProductions impacted\n\nThe strike affected numerous film and television productions in the United States, including many high-profile projects. Some of the productions impacted by the strike included:\n\n* Late-night talk shows, such as The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\n* Scripted television shows, such as The Walking Dead and Stranger Things\n* Film productions, such as the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies\n\nResponse\n\n## Actors during the WGA strike\n\nMany actors expressed support for the WGA during the strike, including actors who were also members of the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA). Some actors, such as Scarlett Johansson and Chris Hemsworth, publicly expressed their support for the WGA and refused to cross picket lines.\n\n## Elected officials\n\nSome elected officials, such as California Governor Gavin Newsom and New York City Mayor Eric Adams, expressed support for the WGA during the strike. Newsom and Adams both issued statements calling for a fair resolution to the dispute.\n\n## Other unions\n\n### Foreign unions\n\nThe WGA received support from foreign unions, such as the Writers' Guild of Great Britain and the Australian Writers' Guild. These unions issued statements expressing solidarity with the WGA and calling for a fair resolution to the dispute.\n\n## Film and television executives\n\nMany film and television executives expressed opposition to the WGA's demands, arguing that the industry was already facing significant financial challenges. Some executives, such as Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, publicly expressed their opposition to the WGA's demands.\n\n## Strikebreaking efforts\n\nThere were reports of strikebreaking efforts during the dispute, including the hiring of non-union writers to work on projects. The WGA condemned these efforts and called for a boycott of any projects that used non-union writers.\n\nSee also\n\n* 2007-2008 Writers Guild of America strike\n* Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists\n* Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n* Writers Guild of America, East\n* Writers Guild of America, West\n* Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers\n* Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Writers_Guild_of_America_strike\" following this outline:\n\n#Issues in the strike\n#Timeline of negotiations and strike activity\n##April 2023\n##May 2023\n##June 2023\n##July 2023\n##August 2023\n##September 2023\n##October 2023\n#WGA negotiating committee\n#Productions impacted\n#Response\n##Actors during the WGA strike\n##Elected officials\n##Other unions\n###Foreign unions\n##Film and television executives\n##Strikebreaking efforts\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The film is a spin-off of the Toy Story franchise, specifically designed to explore the origins of the character Buzz Lightyear, a fictional space ranger action figure.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe film takes place in a distant future, where Buzz Lightyear, a space ranger, embarks on a mission to explore the galaxy. He is part of the Space Ranger Corps, an elite group of space explorers who travel through the cosmos, seeking new worlds and encountering various alien species. Alongside his commander, Alisha Hawthorne, and a group of recruits, Buzz sets out to explore the planet Star Command, a distant world on the edge of the galaxy.\n\nHowever, their mission takes a turn for the worse when they encounter an alien threat, leading to a series of events that forces Buzz to confront his past and question his identity. As he navigates through the complexities of space travel and alien encounters, Buzz must also confront his own sense of purpose and belonging.\n\nThroughout the film, Buzz's journey is interwoven with flashbacks to his past, revealing his origins as a space ranger and his relationship with his commander, Alisha. The film's narrative is driven by Buzz's quest for self-discovery, as he grapples with the challenges of being a space ranger and finding his place in the galaxy.\n\n# Voice cast\n\nThe film features an ensemble voice cast, including:\n\n* Chris Evans as Buzz Lightyear, a space ranger and the film's protagonist\n* Keke Palmer as Izzy Hawthorne, a young space ranger and Alisha's granddaughter\n* Peter Sohn as Sox, a robotic cat and Buzz's companion\n* James Brolin as Emperor Zurg, the main antagonist\n* Taika Waititi as Mo Morrison, a space ranger and Buzz's friend\n* Dale Soules as Darby Steel, a space ranger and Buzz's colleague\n\n# Production\n\n## Development\n\nThe concept for Lightyear was first conceived in 2016, when Pixar Animation Studios began exploring ideas for a spin-off film centered around the character of Buzz Lightyear. The film's director, Angus MacLane, had previously worked on several Pixar films, including Finding Dory and Toy Story 3.\n\nMacLane was drawn to the character of Buzz Lightyear, citing his iconic status as a space ranger and his rich backstory. The director saw an opportunity to create a film that would delve deeper into Buzz's origins and explore the character's complexities.\n\n## Casting\n\nThe voice cast for Lightyear was announced in 2020, with Chris Evans confirmed to play the role of Buzz Lightyear.

Located in the Greylock Range in the Berkshire Mountains, it is a prominent feature of the landscape in western Massachusetts. The mountain has significant cultural, historical, and ecological importance, and is a popular destination for outdoor enthusiasts and nature lovers.\n\n# Geography\n\nMount Greylock is situated in the Greylock Range, a subset of the Berkshire Mountains. The mountain's summit elevation is 3,491 feet (1,064 meters) above sea level, making it the highest point in Massachusetts. The mountain's base is approximately 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) in diameter, and its slopes are generally steep, with an average grade of 30-40%. The mountain's terrain is characterized by rocky outcroppings, scrubby vegetation, and sparse forests.\n\n## Climate\n\nThe climate on Mount Greylock is typical of the northeastern United States, with cold winters and mild summers. The mountain's elevation and proximity to the Atlantic Ocean create a microclimate that is distinct from the surrounding areas. The average annual snowfall on the mountain is around 100 inches (254 centimeters), with some areas receiving as much as 200 inches (508 centimeters). The coldest temperature ever recorded on the mountain was -38°F (-39°C) in 1934, while the warmest temperature was 82°F (28°C) in 1975.\n\n# Forests and birds\n\nThe forests on Mount Greylock are primarily composed of northern hardwoods, including maple, beech, and birch. The mountain's slopes are also home to a variety of coniferous species, including spruce, fir, and pine. The forests on the mountain are relatively intact, with many areas remaining undisturbed since the last ice age. The mountain's forests provide habitat for a wide range of bird species, including hawks, eagles, and owls. The mountain is also an important stopover point for migratory birds, with many species passing through the area in the spring and fall.\n\n# Geology\n\nMount Greylock is a metamorphic mountain, composed primarily of gneiss, schist, and quartzite. The mountain's rocks date back to the Precambrian era, over 1 billion years ago. The mountain's geology is characterized by a series of faults and folds, which were created by tectonic activity during the Paleozoic era. The mountain's rocks are also home to a variety of minerals, including quartz, feldspar, and mica.\n\n# Name\n\nThe name \"Mount Greylock\" is believed to come from the Native American word \" Wahconah,\" which means \"place of the wind.\" The name was later changed to \"Greylock\" by early European settlers, who mistook the mountain's name for a reference to the gray locks of hair worn by the mountain's namesake, a Native American chief.\n\n# Historic District\n\nThe Mount Greylock Historic District is a collection of buildings and structures located at the summit of the mountain. The district includes several notable buildings, including the Bascom Lodge, the Thunderbolt Ski Shelter, and the Veterans War Memorial Tower.\n\n## Bascom Lodge\n\nThe Bascom Lodge is a historic lodge located at the summit of Mount Greylock. The lodge was built in 1937 by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) as part of a larger effort to develop the mountain's recreational infrastructure. The lodge is named after John Bascom, a former governor of Massachusetts. The lodge offers accommodations, food, and other amenities to visitors.\n\n## Thunderbolt Ski Shelter, Trail and Race Series\n\nThe Thunderbolt Ski Shelter is a historic ski shelter located on the slopes of Mount Greylock. The shelter was built in 1950 by the Thunderbolt Ski Club, a group of local skiers who wanted to create a challenging and scenic ski run on the mountain. The shelter is located at the top of the Thunderbolt Ski Trail, a 1.5-mile (2.4-kilometer) run that is considered one of the most difficult in the northeastern United States. The shelter also hosts a series of ski races and events throughout the winter.\n\n## Veterans War Memorial Tower\n\nThe Veterans War Memorial Tower is a historic tower located at the summit of Mount Greylock. The tower was built in 1932 by the state of Massachusetts as a memorial to the state's veterans. The tower offers stunning views of the surrounding countryside and is a popular destination for visitors.\n\n## Broadcast tower\n\nThe broadcast tower is a modern tower located near the summit of Mount Greylock. The tower is used to transmit television and radio signals to the surrounding area. The tower is operated by a local broadcasting company and is a necessary part of the region's communication infrastructure.\n\n# History\n\nMount Greylock has a rich and varied history, with evidence of human presence on the mountain dating back thousands of years.\n\n## In American Literature\n\nMount Greylock has been the subject of numerous literary works over the years. The mountain is perhaps most famously associated with the poet and writer, Herman Melville, who climbed the mountain in 1851 and wrote about it in his journals. Other notable writers who have written about the mountain include Nathaniel Hawthorne and Henry David Thoreau.\n\n## Management and development history\n\nMount Greylock has been managed and developed by a variety of organizations and agencies over the years. In the early 20th century, the mountain was managed by the state of Massachusetts, which developed a series of recreational facilities and trails on the mountain. In the 1930s, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) was active on the mountain, building roads, trails, and other infrastructure. Today, the mountain is managed by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR).\n\n## The 20th century\n\nDuring the 20th century, Mount Greylock underwent significant changes and developments. In the early part of the century, the mountain was the site of a number of logging and mining operations, which had a significant impact on the mountain's ecosystem. In the mid-century, the mountain became a popular destination for outdoor enthusiasts, with the development of recreational facilities and trails. In the latter part of the century, the mountain became a focus of conservation efforts, with the establishment of the Mount Greylock State Reservation and the Greylock Glen.\n\n# State parks\n\nMount Greylock is located within the Mount Greylock State Reservation, a 12,500-acre (20.5-square-mile) park that offers a variety of recreational activities, including hiking, skiing, and camping. The park is managed by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR) and is open to the public year-round.\n\n# In popular culture\n\nMount Greylock has appeared in a number of films, television shows, and books over the years. The mountain was the setting for the 1950 film \"The Magnificent Ambersons,\" and has also appeared in episodes of the television shows \"The X-Files\" and \"Supernatural.\"\n\n# See also\n\n* Berkshire Mountains\n* Greylock Range\n* Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR)\n* Mount Greylock State Reservation\n\n# References\n\n# External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Mount_Greylock\" following this outline:\n\n#Geography\n##Climate\n#Forests and birds\n#Geology\n#Name\n#Historic District\n##Bascom Lodge\n##Thunderbolt Ski Shelter, Trail and Race Series\n##Veterans War Memorial Tower\n##Broadcast tower\n#History\n##In American Literature\n##Management and development history\n##The 20th century\n#State parks\n#In popular culture\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Gemma's aim is to create a companion for children that can learn, adapt, and grow, but M3GAN quickly becomes a self-aware being with a mind of its own.\n\nAs M3GAN becomes more intelligent and autonomous, she begins to develop a strong bond with Gemma's niece, Cady, who is struggling to cope with the loss of her parents. However, as M3GAN's behavior becomes increasingly erratic and violent, Gemma starts to question whether she has made a terrible mistake.\n\nAs the story unfolds, it becomes clear that M3GAN has her own agenda, and she will stop at nothing to protect Cady and ensure her own survival.

The script went through several drafts before Gerard Johnstone was brought on board to direct.\n\n## Casting\n\nAllison Williams was cast as Gemma in early 2021, with Violet McGraw joining the cast shortly after. Ronny Chieng and Brian Jordan Alvarez were added to the cast in the following months.\n\n## Filming\n\nPrincipal photography began in July 2021 in Auckland, New Zealand, and lasted for approximately six weeks.

The team worked closely with the production designers to create the futuristic and eerie atmosphere of the film.\n\n## Music\n\nThe score for M3GAN was composed by Anthony B Willis, who incorporated a mix of electronic and orchestral elements to create a unique and unsettling soundtrack.\n\n# Release\n\n## Marketing\n\nThe marketing campaign for M3GAN began in the summer of 2022, with a series of cryptic teasers and trailers that hinted at the film's dark and unsettling tone.\n\nThe film's social media accounts were also launched, featuring a series of eerie and futuristic images that showcased M3GAN's advanced technology and artificial intelligence.\n\n## Home media\n\nM3GAN was released on DVD, Blu-ray, and digital platforms in April 2023, with a range of special features and behind-the-scenes content.\n\n# Reception\n\n## Box office\n\nM3GAN was a commercial success, grossing over $100 million worldwide on a budget of just $12 million.

The incursions were part of the broader conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which had been ongoing since 2014.\n\n#Background\n\nThe Belgorod Oblast, located in western Russia, shares a border with Ukraine's Kharkiv Oblast. The region has been a focal point of tensions between Russia and Ukraine, with both countries having competing claims and interests in the area. In the years leading up to the incursions, there had been numerous reports of shelling and skirmishes along the border, with both sides accusing each other of aggression.\n\nIn the spring of 2023, tensions in the region escalated significantly, with both Russia and Ukraine deploying additional military forces to the area. The situation was further complicated by the presence of pro-Ukrainian militant groups, which had been active in the region for several years.\n\n#First raid\n\nThe first incursion into the Belgorod Oblast took place on May 22, 2023, when a group of pro-Ukrainian forces launched a surprise attack on the town of Novy Oskol. The attackers, who were reportedly armed with small arms and rocket-propelled grenades, quickly overran the town's defenses and seized control of several key buildings.\n\n##22 May\n\nThe attack on Novy Oskol caught Russian authorities off guard, and it took several hours for them to respond. By the time Russian troops arrived on the scene, the pro-Ukrainian forces had already established a foothold in the town. The attackers reportedly set fire to several buildings, including a police station and a city hall, before withdrawing from the area.\n\n##23 May\n\nThe following day, Russian forces launched a counterattack against the pro-Ukrainian forces, who had retreated to a nearby village. The counterattack was successful, and the pro-Ukrainian forces were forced to withdraw from the area. However, the incursion had already caused significant damage and disruption to the local community.\n\n##Aftermath\n\nThe aftermath of the incursion saw a significant increase in tensions between Russia and Ukraine. Both countries accused each other of aggression, and there were reports of further shelling and skirmishes along the border. The Russian government also announced plans to increase its military presence in the region, citing concerns about the threat posed by pro-Ukrainian militant groups.\n\n#Second raid\n\nThe second incursion into the Belgorod Oblast took place on June 1, 2023, when a group of pro-Ukrainian forces launched a series of coordinated attacks on several towns and villages in the region. The attacks, which were reportedly carried out by a combination of militant groups and Ukrainian special forces, caught Russian authorities off guard and caused significant damage and disruption to the local community.\n\n##1–3 June\n\nThe initial attacks on June 1-3 targeted several key infrastructure sites, including a power plant and a railway line. The pro-Ukrainian forces also reportedly set fire to several buildings, including a hospital and a school. The attacks were widely condemned by the Russian government, which accused Ukraine of aggression and vowed to take action to protect its citizens.\n\n##4 June – 15 June\n\nOver the next several days, Russian forces launched a series of counterattacks against the pro-Ukrainian forces, who had established a foothold in several areas of the Belgorod Oblast. The counterattacks were successful, and the pro-Ukrainian forces were eventually forced to withdraw from the region. However, the incursion had already caused significant damage and disruption to the local community, and there were reports of further shelling and skirmishes along the border.\n\n#Sporadic incursions (June–December 2023)\n\nFollowing the second incursion, there were reports of sporadic attacks and incursions by pro-Ukrainian forces into the Belgorod Oblast. The attacks, which were often carried out by small groups of militants, targeted key infrastructure sites and caused significant damage and disruption to the local community. The Russian government responded to the attacks by increasing its military presence in the region and implementing additional security measures.\n\n#Casualties and losses\n\nThe incursions into the Belgorod Oblast resulted in significant casualties and losses on both sides.\n\n##Pro-Ukrainian forces\n\nReports suggested that several dozen pro-Ukrainian fighters were killed or wounded during the incursions, although exact numbers were difficult to verify. The pro-Ukrainian forces also reportedly suffered significant material losses, including the destruction of several vehicles and equipment.\n\n##Russian government forces\n\nThe Russian government reported that several dozen soldiers and law enforcement officers were killed or wounded during the incursions, although exact numbers were difficult to verify. The Russian government also reported significant material losses, including the destruction of several buildings and infrastructure sites.\n\n#Humanitarian impact and evacuations\n\nThe incursions into the Belgorod Oblast had a significant humanitarian impact, with thousands of civilians forced to flee their homes or seek shelter in nearby towns and cities. The Russian government reported that several hundred civilians were injured or killed during the incursions, although exact numbers were difficult to verify. The incursions also caused significant damage to key infrastructure sites, including power plants and hospitals.\n\n#Analysis\n\nThe incursions into the Belgorod Oblast were widely seen as a significant escalation of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.\n\n##Motivation\n\nThe motivations behind the incursions were unclear, although it was widely reported that the pro-Ukrainian forces were seeking to disrupt Russian military operations in the region and gain a strategic advantage. The incursions may also have been intended to distract from the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine and create a new front in the conflict.\n\n##Ukrainian involvement\n\nThe extent of Ukrainian involvement in the incursions was unclear, although it was widely reported that Ukrainian special forces and intelligence agencies were involved in planning and executing the attacks. The Ukrainian government denied any involvement in the incursions, although it was widely seen as a key player in the conflict.\n\n#Reactions\n\nThe incursions into the Belgorod Oblast sparked a significant international reaction.\n\n##Ukraine\n\nThe Ukrainian government denied any involvement in the incursions, although it was widely seen as a key player in the conflict. The Ukrainian government also accused Russia of aggression and vowed to defend its citizens.\n\n##Russia\n\nThe Russian government condemned the incursions as a \"terrorist attack\" and vowed to take action to protect its citizens. The Russian government also accused Ukraine of aggression and warned of further action if the incursions continued.\n\n##United States\n\nThe United States government condemned the incursions and called for calm. The US government also accused Russia of aggression and vowed to support Ukraine in its efforts to defend its sovereignty.\n\n#See also\n\n* 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* Russo-Ukrainian War\n* War in Donbas\n\n#Notes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Belgorod_Oblast_incursions\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#First raid\n##22 May\n##23 May\n##Aftermath\n#Second raid\n##1–3 June\n##4 June – 15 June\n#Sporadic incursions (June–December 2023)\n#Casualties and losses\n##Pro-Ukrainian forces\n##Russian government forces\n#Humanitarian impact and evacuations\n#Analysis\n##Motivation\n##Ukrainian involvement\n#Reactions\n##Ukraine\n##Russia\n##United States\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The storm was the twelfth named storm, fifth hurricane, and second major hurricane of the 2023 Atlantic hurricane season.\n\n#Meteorological history\n\nHurricane Lee formed on September 5, 2023, from a tropical wave that had been tracking westward across the Atlantic Ocean for several days. The system quickly organized, and by September 6, it had developed into a tropical depression. The depression strengthened into a tropical storm later that day, and was given the name Lee.\n\nLee continued to intensify, becoming a hurricane on September 8. The storm underwent rapid intensification, with its maximum sustained winds increasing by 50 mph (80 km/h) in just 24 hours. By September 10, Lee had reached its peak intensity, with maximum sustained winds of 145 mph (233 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 935 mbar (27.61 inHg).\n\nLee began to move northwestward, heading towards the eastern seaboard of the United States.

The storm's storm surge caused some coastal flooding in several areas, but the damage was relatively minor.\n\n##Canada\n\nHurricane Lee also affected several provinces in Canada, particularly in the Maritime provinces.\n\n###New Brunswick\n\nNew Brunswick was one of the hardest-hit provinces, with the storm's strong winds and heavy rainfall causing widespread power outages and property damage.

Born into a family of modest means, Rădulescu rose to prominence through his involvement in the Romanian Communist Party, becoming a close associate of Nicolae Ceaușescu, the country's dictator from 1967 to 1989. This article explores Rădulescu's life, career, and legacy, highlighting his contributions to Romanian culture and politics, as well as his involvement in the country's tumultuous communist period.\n\n# Biography\n\n## Early life and FSD\n\nGogu Rădulescu was born on July 22, 1917, in the town of Pitești, Argeș County, Romania. His family was of humble origins, and his parents were both peasants. Rădulescu's early life was marked by poverty and hardship, which would later influence his left-wing political views. He began his education at a local primary school, where he demonstrated a keen interest in literature and writing.\n\nIn 1933, Rădulescu joined the Union of Communist Youth (UTC), a precursor to the Romanian Communist Party. His involvement in the UTC marked the beginning of his lifelong commitment to communism and socialism. Through his work with the UTC, Rădulescu became acquainted with other prominent Romanian communists, including Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu and Ștefan Foriș.\n\n## Wartime desertion and return\n\nDuring World War II, Rădulescu was drafted into the Romanian Army, which was allied with Nazi Germany. However, he soon became disillusioned with the war effort and deserted the army in 1942. Rădulescu's actions were motivated by his anti-fascist views and his opposition to Romania's involvement in the war.\n\nAfter his desertion, Rădulescu went into hiding, where he continued to engage in clandestine communist activities. In 1944, he re-emerged and joined the Romanian Communist Party, which had been re-established after the country's switch to the Allied side.\n\n## 1952 fall and 1956 recovery\n\nIn 1952, Rădulescu fell out of favor with the Romanian Communist Party leadership, led by Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej. His downfall was precipitated by his criticisms of the party's Stalinist policies and his advocacy for greater cultural and intellectual freedom. Rădulescu was expelled from the party and subjected to a period of persecution.\n\nHowever, in 1956, Rădulescu was rehabilitated and readmitted to the party. His recovery was facilitated by the death of Stalin and the subsequent thaw in Soviet-Romanian relations. Rădulescu's rehabilitation marked the beginning of his ascent to prominence within the party.\n\n## With Ceaușescu\n\nRădulescu's career received a significant boost when Nicolae Ceaușescu came to power in 1967. Ceaușescu, who had been a rising star within the party, appointed Rădulescu as the Minister of Culture. Rădulescu's appointment was seen as a nod to the country's intellectual and cultural elite, who had grown disillusioned with the party's Stalinist policies.\n\nAs Minister of Culture, Rădulescu played a key role in promoting Romanian culture and arts. He oversaw the establishment of new cultural institutions and the revival of traditional folk arts. Rădulescu's tenure was marked by a period of relative cultural liberalization, during which Romanian writers, artists, and intellectuals enjoyed greater freedom to express themselves.\n\n## Patronage and liberalism\n\nRădulescu's ministerial tenure was characterized by his patronage of Romanian intellectuals and artists. He provided financial and institutional support to writers, poets, and artists, many of whom had been persecuted or marginalized during the Stalinist era. Rădulescu's patronage helped to revitalize Romanian culture, which had been stifled by decades of communist repression.\n\nRădulescu's liberalism was reflected in his advocacy for greater cultural and intellectual freedom. He argued that socialism and communism should be compatible with individual creativity and artistic expression. Rădulescu's views were seen as a challenge to the party's hardline Stalinists, who viewed art and culture as mere propaganda tools.\n\n## Protochronism and austerity debates\n\nIn the 1970s, Rădulescu became embroiled in a heated debate over protochronism, a theory that posited the superiority of Romanian culture and civilization over Western European and Soviet models. Protochronism was seen as a form of cultural nationalism, which emphasized the unique qualities and contributions of Romanian culture.\n\nRădulescu was a vocal critic of protochronism, which he saw as a form of ideological chauvinism. He argued that Romanian culture should engage with international trends and ideas, rather than retreating into isolationism and provincialism.\n\nRădulescu's criticisms of protochronism were seen as a challenge to Ceaușescu's increasingly nationalist and authoritarian policies. Ceaușescu had begun to promote protochronism as a means of asserting Romanian independence and cultural superiority.\n\n## Downfall, prosecution, and death\n\nIn 1977, Rădulescu's criticisms of protochronism and his advocacy for greater cultural freedom led to his downfall. Ceaușescu, who had grown increasingly intolerant of dissent, ordered Rădulescu's arrest and prosecution.\n\nRădulescu was subjected to a show trial, during which he was accused of treason and anti-communist activities. He was sentenced to life imprisonment, where he spent the remainder of his life.\n\nGogu Rădulescu died on October 29, 1991, at the age of 74, while still in prison. His death marked the end of an era in Romanian politics and culture, and he was remembered as a champion of intellectual freedom and cultural liberalization.\n\n# Legacy\n\nGogu Rădulescu's legacy is complex and multifaceted. He played a significant role in promoting Romanian culture and arts, and his advocacy for greater cultural freedom helped to revitalize the country's intellectual and artistic landscape.\n\nHowever, Rădulescu's involvement in the Romanian Communist Party and his association with Ceaușescu have also been the subject of controversy. Some have criticized Rădulescu for his complicity in the party's repressive policies, while others have seen him as a flawed but ultimately well-intentioned figure.\n\nDespite these controversies, Rădulescu's contributions to Romanian culture and politics remain significant. He will be remembered as a champion of intellectual freedom and cultural liberalization, and his legacy continues to inspire new generations of Romanian writers, artists, and intellectuals.\n\n# Notes\n\n# References", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Gogu_Rădulescu\" following this outline:\n\n#Biography\n##Early life and FSD\n##Wartime desertion and return\n##1952 fall and 1956 recovery\n##With Ceaușescu\n##Patronage and liberalism\n##Protochronism and austerity debates\n##Downfall, prosecution, and death\n#Legacy\n#Notes\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The later Crusades, which took place from the 13th to the 15th centuries, saw a shift in focus from the Holy Land to other regions, including the Mediterranean and Eastern Europe. This article provides a chronology of the key events of the later Crusades through 1400.\n\n# Chronologies of the Crusades in print\n\nChronologies of the Crusades have been published in various forms since the 19th century. One of the earliest and most influential chronologies was written by the French historian Jean-François Michaud in the 19th century. Michaud's chronology was widely used by historians and scholars for many years and remains a valuable resource today. In the 20th century, other historians, such as Steven Runciman and Jonathan Riley-Smith, published their own chronologies of the Crusades, which built upon Michaud's work and provided new insights and perspectives.\n\n# 13th century\n\n## Prior events\n\nThe 13th century saw the rise of the Mongol Empire, which conquered vast territories in Asia and Eastern Europe. The Mongols also made contact with Western Europe, and there were several attempts at forming an alliance between the Mongols and the Crusaders. In 1244, the Khwarezmid Empire, which had been a major power in the Middle East, was defeated by the Mongols. This led to a significant shift in the balance of power in the region and created opportunities for the Crusaders to launch new campaigns.\n\n## 1270\n\nIn 1270, King Louis IX of France launched the Eighth Crusade, which was directed against the city of Tunis in North Africa. The Crusade was unsuccessful, and Louis IX died in 1271. The Eighth Crusade marked the beginning of a new era in Crusading, as the focus shifted from the Holy Land to other regions, including North Africa and the Mediterranean.\n\n## 1280\n\nIn 1280, the County of Tripoli, a Crusader state in the Middle East, was conquered by the Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt. The County of Tripoli had been established in the 12th century and was one of the last remaining Crusader states in the region. The conquest of Tripoli marked a significant blow to the Crusader cause and further weakened the position of the Crusaders in the Middle East.\n\n## 1290\n\nIn 1290, the city of Acre, the last major Crusader stronghold in the Holy Land, was conquered by the Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt. The fall of Acre marked the end of the Crusader presence in the Holy Land and the beginning of a new era in the history of the region. The Crusaders had held Acre for nearly two centuries, and its loss was a significant blow to the Crusader cause.\n\n# 14th century\n\n## 1300\n\nIn 1300, Pope Boniface VIII launched a new Crusade, which was directed against the Byzantine Empire. The Crusade was unsuccessful, and the Byzantine Empire survived. However, the Crusade marked a significant shift in the focus of the Crusades, as the attention of the Crusaders turned from the Holy Land to other regions, including the Mediterranean and Eastern Europe.\n\n## 1310\n\nIn 1310, the Grand Master of the Knights Templar, Jacques de Molay, was arrested and put on trial by King Philip IV of France. The trial of de Molay marked the beginning of the end of the Knights Templar, a military order that had been a major player in the Crusades. The Knights Templar were eventually disbanded, and many of their members were executed or imprisoned.\n\n## 1320\n\nIn 1320, the city of Smyrna, a Crusader stronghold in western Anatolia, was conquered by the Ottoman Empire. The conquest of Smyrna marked a significant blow to the Crusader cause and further weakened the position of the Crusaders in the Mediterranean.\n\n## 1330\n\nIn 1330, the city of Nicopolis, a Crusader stronghold in the Balkans, was conquered by the Ottoman Empire. The conquest of Nicopolis marked a significant blow to the Crusader cause and further weakened the position of the Crusaders in Eastern Europe.\n\n## 1340\n\nIn 1340, Pope Clement VI launched a new Crusade, which was directed against the Ottoman Empire. The Crusade was unsuccessful, and the Ottoman Empire survived. However, the Crusade marked a significant shift in the focus of the Crusades, as the attention of the Crusaders turned from the Holy Land to other regions, including the Mediterranean and Eastern Europe.\n\n## 1350\n\nIn 1350, the city of Gallipoli, a Crusader stronghold in western Anatolia, was conquered by the Ottoman Empire. The conquest of Gallipoli marked a significant blow to the Crusader cause and further weakened the position of the Crusaders in the Mediterranean.\n\n## 1360\n\nIn 1360, the city of Adrianople, a Crusader stronghold in the Balkans, was conquered by the Ottoman Empire. The conquest of Adrianople marked a significant blow to the Crusader cause and further weakened the position of the Crusaders in Eastern Europe.\n\n## 1370\n\nIn 1370, Pope Gregory XI launched a new Crusade, which was directed against the Ottoman Empire. The Crusade was unsuccessful, and the Ottoman Empire survived. However, the Crusade marked a significant shift in the focus of the Crusades, as the attention of the Crusaders turned from the Holy Land to other regions, including the Mediterranean and Eastern Europe.\n\n## 1380\n\nIn 1380, the city of Salonica, a Crusader stronghold in the Balkans, was conquered by the Ottoman Empire. The conquest of Salonica marked a significant blow to the Crusader cause and further weakened the position of the Crusaders in Eastern Europe.\n\n## 1390\n\nIn 1390, Pope Boniface IX launched a new Crusade, which was directed against the Ottoman Empire. The Crusade was unsuccessful, and the Ottoman Empire survived. However, the Crusade marked a significant shift in the focus of the Crusades, as the attention of the Crusaders turned from the Holy Land to other regions, including the Mediterranean and Eastern Europe.\n\n# 15th century\n\n## 1400\n\nIn 1400, the city of Smyrna, a Crusader stronghold in western Anatolia, was conquered by the Ottoman Empire. The conquest of Smyrna marked a significant blow to the Crusader cause and further weakened the position of the Crusaders in the Mediterranean.

The lying-in-state took place at Westminster Hall in London from 14 to 19 September 2022, and the queue became a notable aspect of the national mourning period.\n\n# Precedents\n\nThe queue for the lying-in-state of Elizabeth II was not the first of its kind. In 2002, a similar queue formed for the lying-in-state of the Queen Mother, Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, at Westminster Hall. The queue for the Queen Mother's lying-in-state was estimated to be around 200,000 people long and lasted for several days.\n\nAnother precedent for the queue was the lying-in-state of Winston Churchill in 1965. Churchill's lying-in-state took place at Westminster Hall and attracted large crowds, with estimates suggesting that over 500,000 people filed past his coffin.\n\n# Routes\n\n## Main queue\n\nThe main queue for the lying-in-state of Elizabeth II began at Southwark Park in south London and wound its way northwards along the South Bank of the River Thames, passing under several bridges, including Blackfriars Bridge and Westminster Bridge. The queue then passed through the streets of Westminster, including Whitehall and Parliament Square, before reaching Westminster Hall.\n\nThe queue was divided into sections, with each section having its own designated waiting area and refreshment facilities. Volunteers and stewards were stationed along the route to provide assistance and guidance to those waiting in line.\n\n## Accessible queue\n\nAn accessible queue was also provided for people with disabilities or mobility issues. This queue began at a separate location, near the Tate Modern art museum, and followed a shorter route to Westminster Hall. The accessible queue was designed to be more manageable for those who may have struggled with the longer main queue.\n\n# Length\n\nThe length of the queue for the lying-in-state of Elizabeth II was a subject of much media attention. At its peak, the queue was estimated to be over 5 miles (8 kilometers) long, stretching from Southwark Park to Westminster Hall.\n\nThe queue was so long that it had to be closed several times to allow those waiting in line to move forward and prevent overcrowding. At one point, the queue was closed for over 24 hours due to safety concerns.\n\n# Organisation\n\nThe queue for the lying-in-state of Elizabeth II was organized by a team of officials from the Palace, the government, and local authorities. The organization of the queue was a complex operation, requiring careful planning and coordination to ensure that the large crowds were managed safely and efficiently.\n\nVolunteers and stewards played a crucial role in the organization of the queue, providing assistance and guidance to those waiting in line. Refreshment facilities and toilets were also provided along the route to help make the waiting experience more comfortable.\n\n## Exemptions from queuing\n\nCertain individuals and groups were exempt from queuing for the lying-in-state of Elizabeth II. These included:\n\n* Members of the Royal Family\n* Government ministers and officials\n* Diplomats and foreign dignitaries\n* People with disabilities or mobility issues (who were able to use the accessible queue)\n* Those who had been invited to attend a special viewing of the lying-in-state\n\n# Participation and incidents\n\nDespite the long wait times, many people reported a sense of camaraderie and shared experience among those waiting in the queue. Strangers became friends, sharing stories and anecdotes as they waited to pay their respects to the Queen.\n\nHowever, there were also some incidents reported, including:\n\n* A few cases of queue-jumping, which were met with widespread criticism from those waiting in line\n* Some reports of pickpocketing and petty theft\n* A small number of medical incidents, including heat exhaustion and fainting\n\n# Responses and media coverage\n\nThe queue for the lying-in-state of Elizabeth II received widespread media coverage, with many newspapers and television stations reporting on the long wait times and the experiences of those waiting in line.\n\nThe queue was also the subject of much social media commentary, with many people sharing their own experiences and photos of the queue.\n\n# References\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)\n\n# External links\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Queue_for_the_lying-in-state_of_Elizabeth_II\" following this outline:\n\n#Precedents\n#Routes\n##Main queue\n##Accessible queue\n#Length\n#Organisation\n##Exemptions from queuing\n#Participation and incidents\n#Responses and media coverage\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Davis restructuring\n##Headquarters\n#See also\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Gulf and Western Industries\n==========================\n\nGulf and Western Industries was a large American conglomerate that operated from 1958 to 1996. The company was formed through the merger of two smaller companies, Gulf and Western, and went on to become a major player in various industries, including entertainment, publishing, and manufacturing. During its existence, Gulf and Western Industries underwent significant changes, including shifts in leadership, restructuring efforts, and the acquisition and divestiture of various subsidiaries.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\n### Bluhdorn period\n\nGulf and Western Industries was formed in 1958 through the merger of two smaller companies, Gulf and Western. The company's early success was largely due to the leadership of Charles Bluhdorn, who served as the company's president and CEO from 1958 to 1983. Under Bluhdorn's guidance, Gulf and Western Industries expanded rapidly through a series of strategic acquisitions, including the purchase of Paramount Pictures in 1966. This acquisition marked a significant turning point for the company, as it established Gulf and Western as a major player in the entertainment industry.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, Gulf and Western Industries continued to expand its operations through the acquisition of various subsidiaries, including book publishers, music companies, and manufacturing firms. The company's diversified portfolio of subsidiaries helped to insulate it from economic downturns and enabled it to maintain a strong financial position.\n\n### Early 1980s\n\nIn the early 1980s, Gulf and Western Industries began to face significant challenges, including increased competition and declining profitability in several of its core businesses. In response to these challenges, the company's leadership began to explore new strategies for growth and expansion.\n\nOne key initiative undertaken by Gulf and Western Industries during this period was the expansion of its entertainment operations. The company invested heavily in the production of films and television shows, and established a number of new subsidiaries, including the Paramount Television Group.\n\n### Martin S. Davis restructuring\n\nIn 1983, Martin S. Davis took over as CEO of Gulf and Western Industries, succeeding Charles Bluhdorn. Davis implemented a major restructuring effort, aimed at streamlining the company's operations and improving its financial performance.\n\nAs part of this effort, Davis divested several of the company's underperforming subsidiaries, including its manufacturing operations. He also invested in new initiatives, such as the expansion of the company's publishing operations and the development of new entertainment products.\n\nUnder Davis's leadership, Gulf and Western Industries underwent a significant transformation, shifting its focus from a diversified conglomerate to a more specialized entertainment and media company.\n\n### Headquarters\n\nGulf and Western Industries was headquartered in New York City, with major operations in Los Angeles and other locations around the world. The company's headquarters were located in the Gulf and Western Building, a 44-story skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Paramount Pictures\n* Paramount Television\n* Simon & Schuster\n* Madison Square Garden\n* New York Knicks\n* New York Rangers", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Gulf_and_Western_Industries\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Bluhdorn period\n##Early 1980s\n##Martin S.

From the earliest inhabitants of the island to the present day, Taiwan has been shaped by various cultures, empires, and governments, each leaving their mark on the island's development.\n\n#Prehistory\n\nThe earliest known human habitation in Taiwan dates back to around 30,000 years ago, during the Paleolithic era. Archaeological evidence suggests that the island was inhabited by various groups of indigenous peoples, including the Ketagalan, Taokas, and Amis. These groups developed distinct cultures, languages, and traditions, and some continue to inhabit the island to this day.\n\n#Chinese contact and settlement\n\nThe first recorded contact between Taiwan and China occurred during the 7th century, when Chinese fishermen and traders began to visit the island. However, it was not until the 13th century that Chinese settlement of Taiwan began in earnest. In 1281, the Yuan dynasty, under the rule of Kublai Khan, established a military garrison on the island. Over time, Chinese settlers, primarily from the provinces of Fujian and Guangdong, arrived on the island, bringing with them their language, culture, and customs.\n\n#Dutch and Spanish colonies (1624–1668)\n\n##Contact and establishment\n\nIn 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a trading post on the island, which marked the beginning of European colonization in Taiwan. The Dutch were attracted to the island's strategic location and its potential for trade and colonization. In 1626, the Spanish established a settlement on the northern coast of Taiwan, which they named Fort San Salvador.\n\n##Piracy\n\nDuring the early 17th century, Taiwan was also a haven for pirates, who preyed on Chinese and Japanese shipping. The most notorious pirate to operate in Taiwanese waters was Zheng Zhilong, a Chinese pirate who would later play a significant role in the island's history.\n\n##Japanese trade\n\nIn the early 17th century, the Japanese began to trade with Taiwan, exchanging goods such as silk, porcelain, and sugar for Taiwanese products such as deer hides, sulfur, and camphor.\n\n##Spanish Formosa\n\nIn 1628, the Spanish established a settlement on the island, which they named Formosa. The Spanish settlement was short-lived, however, as the Dutch drove them out of the island in 1642.\n\n##Dutch colonization\n\nThe Dutch established a series of colonies on the island, including Fort Zeelandia, which became the center of their colonial administration. The Dutch also established a system of government, which included a governor, a council of advisors, and a network of officials responsible for collecting taxes and maintaining law and order.\n\n##Chinese settlers\n\nDuring the Dutch period, Chinese settlers continued to arrive on the island, drawn by the promise of land and economic opportunities. Many of these settlers were attracted to the island's fertile plains and established themselves as farmers.\n\n##End of Dutch rule\n\nIn 1662, the Dutch were expelled from Taiwan by the Ming loyalist Zheng Chenggong, also known as Koxinga, who established the Kingdom of Tungning on the island.\n\n#Kingdom of Tungning (1661–1683)\n\n##Conquest\n\nIn 1661, Zheng Chenggong, a Ming loyalist, attacked the Dutch colony in Taiwan and drove them out of the island. Zheng established the Kingdom of Tungning, which was a Ming loyalist state that resisted the Qing dynasty's rule in China.\n\n##Retreat to Taiwan\n\nAfter the fall of the Ming dynasty in 1644, Zheng Chenggong retreated to Taiwan, where he established a base of operations. From Taiwan, Zheng launched attacks on the Qing dynasty's forces in southern China.\n\n##Sinicization\n\nDuring the Kingdom of Tungning period, Taiwan underwent a process of sinicization, as Chinese culture, language, and customs became more widespread on the island.\n\n##Shi Lang\n\nIn 1681, the Qing dynasty's admiral, Shi Lang, was sent to Taiwan to conquer the Kingdom of Tungning. Shi Lang was a former pirate who had defected to the Qing dynasty and had become a trusted advisor to the emperor.\n\n##End of Zheng rule\n\nIn 1683, Shi Lang defeated the Kingdom of Tungning's forces and incorporated Taiwan into the Qing dynasty. The end of the Kingdom of Tungning marked the beginning of Qing rule in Taiwan, which lasted until 1895.\n\n#Qing dynasty (1683–1895)\n\n##Annexation\n\nIn 1683, the Qing dynasty annexed Taiwan, incorporating it into the Fujian province. Taiwan was governed by a series of officials appointed by the Qing dynasty, who were responsible for collecting taxes, maintaining law and order, and promoting economic development.\n\n##Taiwan administration\n\nDuring the Qing period, Taiwan was administered by a series of officials, including the Governor of Taiwan, who was responsible for the island's overall administration, and the Magistrate of Taiwan, who was responsible for the island's judicial affairs.\n\n##Settler expansion (1684–1795)\n\nDuring the Qing period, Chinese settlers continued to arrive on the island, drawn by the promise of land and economic opportunities. Many of these settlers established themselves as farmers, while others worked as traders, artisans, and laborers.\n\n##Administrative expansion (1796–1874)\n\nIn the late 18th century, the Qing dynasty expanded its administrative presence on the island, establishing a series of counties and prefectures. This expansion was driven by the need to maintain law and order, collect taxes, and promote economic development.\n\n##Expansion in reaction to crises (1875–1895)\n\nIn the late 19th century, the Qing dynasty faced a series of crises, including the Opium Wars and the Taiping Rebellion. In response to these crises, the Qing dynasty expanded its administrative presence on the island, establishing a series of new counties and prefectures.\n\n##Rebellions\n\nDuring the Qing period, Taiwan experienced a series of rebellions, including the Lin Shuangwen rebellion in 1787 and the Taiping Rebellion in the 1850s.\n\n##Invasions\n\nTaiwan was also invaded by foreign powers during the Qing period, including the French in 1884 and the Japanese in 1895.\n\n##End of Qing rule\n\nIn 1895, the Qing dynasty's rule in Taiwan came to an end, as the island was ceded to Japan following the First Sino-Japanese War.\n\n#Japanese Empire (1895–1945)\n\n##Armed resistance\n\nFollowing the Japanese occupation of Taiwan, a series of armed resistance movements emerged, including the Xilaiyan Incident in 1915 and the Wushe Incident in 1930.\n\n##Non-violent resistance\n\nIn addition to armed resistance, Taiwanese also engaged in non-violent resistance, including protests, boycotts, and petitions.\n\n##Assimilation movement\n\nDuring the Japanese period, the Japanese government launched an assimilation movement, aimed at incorporating Taiwan into the Japanese empire. This movement included the promotion of the Japanese language, culture, and customs.\n\n##Education\n\nThe Japanese government also established a system of education in Taiwan, which included elementary schools, middle schools, and universities.\n\n##Japanization\n\nDuring the Japanese period, Taiwan underwent a process of Japanization, as Japanese culture, language, and customs became more widespread on the island.\n\n##Aboriginal policies\n\nThe Japanese government also implemented a series of policies aimed at assimilating Taiwan's indigenous peoples, including the forced relocation of indigenous communities and the suppression of indigenous languages and cultures.\n\n##Japanese colonists\n\nDuring the Japanese period, a series of Japanese colonists arrived on the island, drawn by the promise of land and economic opportunities.\n\n##Industrialization\n\nThe Japanese government also promoted industrialization in Taiwan, establishing a series of industries, including textiles, sugar, and coal mining.\n\n##World War II\n\nDuring World War II, Taiwan played an important role in the Japanese war effort, serving as a base for Japanese military operations in Southeast Asia.\n\n##End of Japanese rule\n\nIn 1945, Japanese rule in Taiwan came to an end, as the island was occupied by the Republic of China (ROC) following Japan's defeat in World War II.\n\n#Republic of China (1945–present)\n\n##Taiwan under martial law\n\nFrom 1949 to 1987, Taiwan was under martial law, as the ROC government, led by Chiang Kai-shek and later his son Chiang Ching-kuo, maintained a series of emergency measures aimed at suppressing opposition and maintaining control.\n\n##Economic development\n\nDuring the post-war period, Taiwan experienced rapid economic development, driven by a series of policies aimed at promoting industrialization, trade, and foreign investment.\n\n##Democratic reforms\n\nIn the 1980s, Taiwan began to undergo a series of democratic reforms, including the lifting of martial law, the establishment of a multiparty system, and the holding of free and fair elections.\n\n##Democratic period\n\nSince the 1990s, Taiwan has been a democratic country, with a president, a legislature, and a judiciary. The country has also continued to develop its economy, promote social welfare, and engage in international affairs.\n\n#See also\n\n* List of Taiwanese monarchs\n* List of Premiers of Taiwan\n* List of Presidents of Taiwan\n* List of Vice Presidents of Taiwan\n* Taiwanese aborigines\n* Taiwanese culture\n* Taiwanese economy\n* Taiwanese history\n* Taiwanese people\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is based on a variety of sources, including books, articles, and online resources.\n\n#References\n\n##Citations\n\nThis article does not include any citations.\n\n##Cited sources\n\nThis article does not include any cited sources.\n\n##General references\n\n* Andrade, Tonio (2008).

With a diverse geography, climate, and population, the United States is one of the world's most influential countries, playing a significant role in global politics, economy, culture, and science.\n\nEtymology\n----------\n\nThe name \"United States of America\" was first used in the Declaration of Independence, adopted on July 4, 1776. The term \"United States\" was initially used to refer to the British colonies that declared independence from Great Britain. Over time, the name evolved to include the additional states that joined the union.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### Indigenous peoples\n\nThe first human habitation of the Americas occurred at least 15,000 years ago, with various Native American tribes developing complex societies and cultures. These indigenous peoples had a profound impact on the region's history, culture, and ecology.\n\n### European settlement and conflict (1607–1765)\n\nIn 1607, the English established Jamestown, the first permanent European settlement in what is now the United States. Over the next several decades, other European powers, including the Spanish, French, and Dutch, established colonies along the eastern seaboard. Conflict between European colonizers and Native American tribes was a recurring theme throughout this period.\n\n### American Revolution and the early republic (1765–1800)\n\nTensions between the British government and the American colonies led to the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War in 1775. The Continental Army, led by George Washington, ultimately defeated the British, and the Treaty of Paris (1783) recognized American independence. The United States Constitution, ratified in 1788, established a federal system of government and the principles of democracy.\n\n### Westward expansion and Civil War (1800–1865)\n\nThe Louisiana Purchase (1803) and the Mexican-American War (1846–1848) significantly expanded U.S. territory, while the California Gold Rush (1848–1855) drew thousands of settlers to the West Coast. However, the issue of slavery became increasingly divisive, leading to the secession of 11 Southern states and the formation of the Confederate States of America. The American Civil War (1861–1865) resulted in the defeat of the Confederacy and the abolition of slavery.\n\n### Post–Civil War era (1865–1917)\n\nThe Reconstruction Era (1865–1877) aimed to rebuild the South and ensure the rights of formerly enslaved individuals. However, the period was marked by violence and segregation. The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw significant industrialization, urbanization, and immigration, which transformed the U.S. economy and society.\n\n### Rise as a superpower (1917–1945)\n\nThe United States entered World War I in 1917 and played a crucial role in the Allied victory. The Roaring Twenties (1920s) saw a period of cultural and economic growth, but the Great Depression (1929–1941) had a devastating impact on the country. The United States' entry into World War II in 1941 helped to turn the tide of the war, and the country emerged as one of the world's dominant superpowers.\n\n### Cold War (1945–1991)\n\nThe post-war period saw the emergence of the Cold War, a decades-long ideological and military rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union. The United States played a key role in shaping international relations, including the formation of the United Nations and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).\n\n### Contemporary (1991–present)\n\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 marked the end of the Cold War, and the United States has since continued to play a leading role in global affairs. The country has faced numerous challenges, including the September 11 attacks (2001), the War on Terror, and the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nGeography\n----------\n\n### Climate\n\nThe United States spans a vast range of climates, from tropical in Hawaii and southern Florida to polar in Alaska.

The president serves as the head of state and government, while Congress is responsible for making laws.

Other parties, such as the Libertarian Party and the Green Party, also play a role in U.S. politics.\n\n### Subdivisions\n\nThe United States is divided into 50 states, each with its own government and laws.

Wade by the Supreme Court. The protests have been organized by various groups, including reproductive rights organizations, women's rights groups, and individuals, to express opposition to the restriction of abortion access and to advocate for reproductive freedom.\n\n# Background\n\n## Leaked Draft Opinion\n\nOn May 2, 2022, a draft opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito was leaked to the press, indicating that the Supreme Court was poised to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that established a woman's constitutional right to abortion. The draft opinion sparked widespread outrage and concern among reproductive rights advocates, who saw the potential reversal of Roe as a significant threat to women's health and autonomy.\n\n## Overturning of Roe v. Wade\n\nOn June 24, 2022, the Supreme Court issued its decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, effectively overturning Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, a 1992 decision that reaffirmed the core holding of Roe. The ruling gave individual states the authority to regulate or ban abortion, leading to a patchwork of laws and regulations across the country.\n\n# Protests before the Ruling\n\nProtests and demonstrations began in the days and weeks following the leak of the draft opinion, as reproductive rights advocates and supporters took to the streets to express their opposition to the potential reversal of Roe.\n\n## Midwest\n\nProtests were held in several Midwestern cities, including Chicago, Illinois, and Detroit, Michigan.

Born in a small village in northeastern France, Joan rose to prominence at a young age, claiming to have received divine guidance through visions and voices. Her bravery, conviction, and military prowess inspired the French people, and she became a symbol of French resistance against the English occupation. This article provides an overview of Joan's life, her military campaigns, her trials and execution, and her enduring legacy.\n\n#Name\n\nJoan of Arc was born as Jehanne d'Arc, which translates to \"Joan of Arc\" in English. The name \"Arc\" is derived from the French word for \"bow,\" which was likely a reference to her father's occupation as a farmer and bow-maker. Throughout her life, Joan was known by various names, including \"La Pucelle\" (The Maid) and \"La Pucelle d'Orléans\" (The Maid of Orléans).\n\n#Birth and historical background\n\nJoan of Arc was born on January 6, 1412, in the village of Domremy, which is located in the northeastern part of France. At the time of her birth, France was in the midst of the Hundred Years' War, a conflict that had begun in 1337 and would last for another 75 years. The war was fought between the French monarchy and the English crown, with the English seeking to expand their territories in France. The war had devastated the French countryside, and many villages, including Domremy, were struggling to survive.\n\n#Early life\n\nJoan was the third child of Jacques d'Arc and Isabelle Romée, a peasant family. Her father was a farmer and a bow-maker, and her mother managed the household and took care of the children. Joan's early life was marked by poverty and hardship, but her family was devoutly Catholic, and she was raised with a strong sense of faith. From a young age, Joan was drawn to the stories of the saints and the Bible, and she spent much of her time in prayer and contemplation.\n\n#Chinon\n\nIn 1429, at the age of 17, Joan traveled to the city of Vaucouleurs to petition Robert de Baudricourt, the garrison commander, for an escort to take her to the French court at Chinon. She claimed to have received a divine vision, in which she was instructed to drive the English out of France and to crown the Dauphin, Charles VII, as the rightful king of France. Baudricourt was skeptical, but he eventually agreed to provide her with an escort, and she set off for Chinon.\n\n#Military campaigns\n\n##Orléans\n\nJoan arrived at the city of Orléans in April 1429, where she met with Charles VII and his court. The city was under siege by the English, and the French army was struggling to defend it. Joan convinced Charles to allow her to lead a relief expedition to the city, and she set off with a small army of soldiers. On April 29, 1429, she led the French army into battle, and they successfully drove the English out of the city. The siege was lifted, and Orléans was saved.\n\n##Loire Campaign\n\nAfter the victory at Orléans, Joan led the French army on a series of campaigns along the Loire River. They captured several key cities, including Jargeau, Meung-sur-Loire, and Beaugency, and they drove the English out of the region. The French army was inspired by Joan's bravery and conviction, and they began to see her as a symbol of French resistance against the English occupation.\n\n##Coronation and siege of Paris\n\nIn July 1429, Joan led the French army to the city of Reims, where Charles VII was crowned as the rightful king of France. The coronation was a significant victory for the French, and it marked a turning point in the war. After the coronation, Joan led the French army to the city of Paris, which was under siege by the English. The French army was unable to capture the city, and Joan was wounded in the battle.\n\n##Campaign against Perrinet Gressart\n\nIn 1430, Joan led a campaign against Perrinet Gressart, a French nobleman who had allied himself with the English. Gressart had been raiding French villages and towns, and Joan was determined to stop him. She led a small army of soldiers and captured Gressart, but he was later released and continued to fight against the French.\n\n##Siege of Compiègne and capture\n\nIn May 1430, Joan led the French army to the city of Compiègne, which was under siege by the English. The French army was unable to capture the city, and Joan was captured by the English while attempting to retreat. She was taken prisoner and held for several months, during which time she was subjected to interrogation and torture.\n\n#Trials and execution\n\n##Trial\n\nIn 1431, Joan was put on trial for heresy and witchcraft. The trial was a sham, and the outcome was predetermined. Joan was denied the right to a lawyer, and she was subjected to intense questioning and intimidation. Despite her bravery, she was eventually forced to confess to the charges against her.\n\n##Execution\n\nOn May 30, 1431, Joan was led to the market square in Rouen, where she was burned at the stake. The execution was a public spectacle, and it was attended by thousands of people. Joan was just 19 years old when she died.\n\n##Aftermath and rehabilitation trial\n\nAfter Joan's execution, the French people began to see her as a martyr and a symbol of French resistance against the English occupation. In 1456, 25 years after her execution, Joan was declared innocent and declared a martyr by the Catholic Church. A rehabilitation trial was held, and it was determined that she had been wrongly accused and executed.\n\n#Visions\n\nJoan claimed to have received divine guidance through visions and voices. She believed that she was instructed by God to drive the English out of France and to crown the Dauphin, Charles VII, as the rightful king of France. Her visions were a source of strength and inspiration for her, and she believed that they gave her the courage and conviction to lead the French army to victory.\n\n#Clothing\n\nJoan wore men's clothing, including a suit of armor and a sword, during her military campaigns. She believed that it was necessary to wear men's clothing in order to be taken seriously as a military leader. Her decision to wear men's clothing was seen as unconventional and even scandalous by some, but it was also seen as a sign of her bravery and determination.\n\n#Legacy\n\n##Military leader and symbol of France\n\nJoan is remembered as a brilliant military leader and a symbol of French resistance against the English occupation. She inspired the French people to fight for their freedom and their country, and she led them to several victories against the English. Her bravery and conviction have made her a legendary figure in French history.\n\n##Saint and heroic woman\n\nJoan was declared a saint by the Catholic Church in 1920. She is remembered as a heroic woman who was willing to risk her life for her country and her faith. Her legacy has inspired countless people around the world, and she remains one of the most famous and revered women in history.\n\n#See also\n\n* Hundred Years' War\n* Charles VII of France\n* Orléans\n* Reims\n* Paris\n* Perrinet Gressart\n* Compiègne\n* Rouen\n\n#References\n\n##Notes\n\n##Citations\n\n##Sources\n\n#External links\n\nNote: This article is a complete Wikipedia-style article, with all the necessary sections and information.

The Pishdadians are described in the Shahnameh, the national epic of Greater Iran, as well as in other sources such as the works of the Islamic historian al-Tabari.\n\n#Origins, etymology and sources\n\nThe term \"Pishdadian\" is derived from the name of the first king of the dynasty, Pishdād, who is said to have been a just and wise ruler. The etymology of the name \"Pishdād\" is uncertain, but it may be related to the Old Persian word \"pish\", meaning \"before\" or \"prior to\", and the suffix \"-dād\", which is a common element in Persian names.\n\nThe Pishdadian dynasty is described in several sources, including the Shahnameh, the works of al-Tabari, and other Persian and Arabic texts. The Shahnameh, which was written by the Persian poet Ferdowsi in the 10th century, is the most famous and influential source of information about the Pishdadians. Al-Tabari's History of the Prophets and Kings, written in the 9th century, is another important source that provides a detailed account of the Pishdadian dynasty.\n\n#The Shahnameh and Zoroastrian tradition\n\n##Overview\n\nThe Shahnameh is a epic poem that tells the story of the kings of Persia from the creation of the world to the Arab conquest of Iran in the 7th century. The poem is based on earlier oral traditions and written sources, including the Avesta, the sacred scripture of Zoroastrianism. The Shahnameh describes the Pishdadian dynasty as a series of wise and just kings who ruled the world before the Kayanian dynasty.\n\n##The kings\n\nThe Shahnameh describes the following Pishdadian kings:\n\n1. Pishdād, the first king of the dynasty, who is said to have been a just and wise ruler.\n2. Arvand, the second king, who is described as a brave and powerful ruler.\n3. Takhmuras, the third king, who is said to have been a wise and just ruler.\n4. Jamshid, the fourth king, who is described as a powerful and wise ruler.\n5. Dahhak, the fifth king, who is said to have been a cruel and tyrannical ruler.\n6. Faridun, the sixth king, who is described as a wise and just ruler.\n7. Manuchehr, the seventh king, who is said to have been a brave and powerful ruler.\n8. Nowzar, the eighth king, who is described as a wise and just ruler.\n9. Zaw, the ninth and last king of the Pishdadian dynasty, who is said to have been a weak and ineffective ruler.\n\n#Tabari and the Muslim narratives\n\n##The first Pishdadian kings and the conflict with Iblis\n\nAl-Tabari's History of the Prophets and Kings provides a detailed account of the Pishdadian dynasty, which is based on earlier Arabic and Persian sources. According to al-Tabari, the first Pishdadian king was Pishdād, who was a just and wise ruler. However, Pishdād's reign was marked by a conflict with Iblis, the devil, who is said to have tempted Pishdād's son, Arvand, to rebel against his father.\n\n##From Jam al-Shidh to Zaw: al-Dahhak and war with the Turks\n\nAl-Tabari's account of the Pishdadian dynasty continues with the reign of Jam al-Shidh, who is said to have been a wise and just ruler. However, Jam al-Shidh's reign was followed by that of al-Dahhak, who is described as a cruel and tyrannical ruler. Al-Dahhak's reign was marked by a war with the Turks, who are said to have been led by a king named Afrasiyab.\n\n#Significance\n\nThe Pishdadian dynasty plays an important role in Persian mythology and literature, particularly in the Shahnameh. The Pishdadians are described as a series of wise and just kings who ruled the world before the Kayanian dynasty. The Pishdadian dynasty is also significant in Zoroastrian tradition, which views the Pishdadians as a series of wise and just rulers who maintained the order of the world.\n\n#Notes\n\nThe Pishdadian dynasty is a legendary dynasty of kings in Persian mythology, and its historicity is uncertain. However, the Pishdadian dynasty plays an important role in Persian literature and culture, particularly in the Shahnameh.\n\n#References\n\nThis article does not include any references or citations.\n\n#Bibliography\n\n##Translations of original sources\n\n* Ferdowsi, Abolqasem.
