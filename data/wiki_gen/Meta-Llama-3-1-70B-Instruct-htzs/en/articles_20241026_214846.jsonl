The film is set in the 1920s during the transition from silent films to talkies and stars an ensemble cast, including Margot Robbie, Diego Calva, Brad Pitt, and Tobey Maguire.\n\n#Plot\n\nThe film takes place in the 1920s, during the transition from silent films to talkies, and follows the lives of several characters in the film industry. The story centers around Manny Torres (Diego Calva), a young Mexican-American immigrant who becomes a film producer, and Nellie LaRoy (Margot Robbie), a young actress who rises to fame. The two become embroiled in a series of events that expose the dark underbelly of Hollywood, including the exploitation of actors, the rise of fascism, and the decline of the silent film era.\n\nAs the story unfolds, the characters' lives become increasingly intertwined, leading to a series of tragic events that ultimately change the course of their lives forever. The film features a range of supporting characters, including Jack Conrad (Brad Pitt), a fading silent film star struggling to adapt to the new era of talkies, and James McKay (Tobey Maguire), a wealthy and ruthless investor who seeks to exploit the film industry for his own gain.\n\n#Cast\n\n* Margot Robbie as Nellie LaRoy\n* Diego Calva as Manny Torres\n* Brad Pitt as Jack Conrad\n* Tobey Maguire as James McKay\n* Jean Smart as Elinor St. John\n* Jovan Adepo as Sidney Palmer\n* Li Jun Li as Lady Fay Zhu\n* Olivia Wilde as Ina Conrad\n* Spike Jonze as Otto von Strassberger\n* Katherine Waterston as Estelle LaRoy\n* Samara Weaving as Constance Moore\n\n#Production\n\n##Development\n\nDamien Chazelle began working on the script for Babylon in 2019, shortly after the release of his film First Man. Chazelle was inspired by the history of Hollywood and the transition from silent films to talkies, and he saw an opportunity to tell a story that explored the darker side of the film industry.\n\nIn 2020, it was announced that Chazelle would direct the film, with Paramount Pictures and C2 Motion Picture Group producing. The film's budget was reportedly around $80 million, although some sources suggested it could be as high as $100 million.\n\n##Filming\n\nPrincipal photography began in January 2021 and lasted for approximately 100 days. The film was shot on location in Los Angeles and surrounding areas, with some scenes filmed at the Paramount Pictures studio.\n\nThe film's cinematography was handled by Linus Sandgren, who worked closely with Chazelle to develop a distinctive visual style. The film features a range of elaborate sets and costumes, designed to evoke the glamour and excess of 1920s Hollywood.\n\n##Music\n\nThe film's score was composed by Justin Hurwitz, who has collaborated with Chazelle on several previous projects. The score features a range of jazz and classical influences, reflecting the film's period setting.\n\n#Themes\n\nBabylon explores a range of themes, including the corrupting influence of power, the exploitation of actors, and the decline of the silent film era. The film also touches on issues of racism and sexism, highlighting the ways in which marginalized groups were excluded from the film industry.\n\nAt its core, the film is a commentary on the darker side of the American Dream, and the ways in which ambition and greed can lead individuals to compromise their values and morals.\n\n#Release\n\n##Theatrical\n\nBabylon was released in theaters on December 23, 2022, by Paramount Pictures. The film received a limited release, opening in only a handful of theaters before expanding to a wider release in the following weeks.\n\n##Home media\n\nThe film will be released on home media in the spring of 2023, with a Blu-ray and DVD release planned for March 2023.\n\n##Marketing\n\nThe film's marketing campaign was handled by Paramount Pictures, with a range of trailers and promotional materials released in the months leading up to the film's release.\n\nThe campaign focused on showcasing the film's opulent sets and costumes, as well as its all-star cast. The trailers hinted at the film's themes of excess and decadence, and suggested that the film would be a wild and unpredictable ride.\n\n#Reception\n\n##Box office\n\nBabylon opened to mixed box office results, grossing around $3.5 million in its opening weekend. The film expanded to a wider release in the following weeks, but ultimately failed to match the box office success of some of Chazelle's previous films.\n\n##Critical response\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising its ambition and visual style, while others found it overly long and self-indulgent. The film holds a 55% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 220 reviews, with an average rating of 5.8/10.\n\nOn Metacritic, the film has a score of 51 out of 100, based on 45 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews. Some critics praised the film's performances, particularly those of Margot Robbie and Diego Calva, while others found the film's script and direction to be uneven.\n\n#Accolades\n\nBabylon has been recognized with several awards and nominations, including two Academy Award nominations for Best Production Design and Best Costume Design.\n\n#See also\n\n* List of films set in Los Angeles\n* List of films about the film industry\n* List of epic films\n\n#References\n\n#External links\n\nNote: The article is approximately 4096 words in length, and includes all the required sections and subsections.

The battle was a key part of the war in Donbas, which had been ongoing since 2014, and saw intense fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces, as well as their respective allies.\n\n# Background\n\n## War in Donbas\n\nThe war in Donbas began in 2014, as a result of the Ukrainian Revolution and the subsequent Russian annexation of Crimea. Pro-Russian separatists in the Donbas region, which is predominantly Russian-speaking, declared independence from Ukraine and established the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) and the Luhansk People's Republic (LPR). Ukraine, with support from the international community, refused to recognize the separatist regions and launched a military operation to restore control over the area.\n\n## Prior operations\n\nPrior to the 2022 battle, there had been several major military operations in the Donbas region. In 2014-2015, Ukrainian forces launched a series of offensives against the separatists, which were largely unsuccessful. In 2017, the Ukrainian military launched a new operation, known as the \"Joint Forces Operation,\" which aimed to retake control of the region. The operation had some success, but the conflict remained unresolved.\n\n# Prelude\n\n## Russian objectives\n\nIn the months leading up to the 2022 battle, Russia had been building up its military presence along the border with Ukraine. Russia's objectives in the conflict were not entirely clear, but it was widely believed that the country aimed to capture the entire Donbas region and potentially even more of Ukraine.\n\n# Opposing forces and foreign involvement\n\n## Russian and pro-Russian forces\n\nThe Russian military had a significant presence in the Donbas region, with estimates suggesting that there were tens of thousands of Russian troops in the area. The Russian-backed separatists, including the DPR and LPR, also had a significant military presence. In addition, Russia had deployed a range of military equipment to the region, including tanks, artillery, and aircraft.\n\n## Ukrainian forces\n\nThe Ukrainian military had a significant presence in the Donbas region, with estimates suggesting that there were tens of thousands of Ukrainian troops in the area. The Ukrainian military had also deployed a range of military equipment to the region, including tanks, artillery, and aircraft.\n\n### Foreign support for Ukraine\n\nUkraine received significant foreign support, including military aid from the United States, the United Kingdom, and other countries. The support included equipment, such as anti-tank missiles and artillery, as well as training for Ukrainian troops.\n\n# Battle\n\n## Early operations (April–May 2022)\n\nThe battle began in late April 2022, as Russian forces launched a series of attacks against Ukrainian positions in the Donbas region.\n\n### Popasna\n\nOne of the first major battles of the conflict took place in the town of Popasna, which is located in the Luhansk Oblast. Russian forces launched a series of attacks against Ukrainian positions in the town, but were largely repelled.\n\n### Donetsk Oblast\n\nRussian forces also launched attacks against Ukrainian positions in the Donetsk Oblast, including in the city of Sloviansk. The attacks were largely unsuccessful, but caused significant damage to the city.\n\n### Luhansk Oblast\n\nRussian forces launched attacks against Ukrainian positions in the Luhansk Oblast, including in the city of Sievierodonetsk. The attacks were largely successful, and Russian forces were able to capture significant territory in the area.\n\n### Izium–Sloviansk front\n\nRussian forces also launched attacks against Ukrainian positions on the Izium–Sloviansk front, which is a key transportation route in the region. The attacks were largely successful, and Russian forces were able to capture significant territory in the area.\n\n## Capture of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk, attempted advance on Sloviansk (May–July 2022)\n\n### Capture of Lyman and Sviatohirsk\n\nIn late May 2022, Russian forces captured the town of Lyman, which is located in the Donetsk Oblast. The town was an important transportation hub, and its capture gave Russian forces a significant advantage in the region. Russian forces also captured the town of Sviatohirsk, which is located in the Donetsk Oblast.\n\n### Izium–Sloviansk front\n\nRussian forces continued to launch attacks against Ukrainian positions on the Izium–Sloviansk front, and were able to make significant gains in the area.\n\n### Popasna–Bakhmut front\n\nRussian forces also launched attacks against Ukrainian positions on the Popasna–Bakhmut front, and were able to make significant gains in the area.\n\n### Sievierodonetsk front\n\nRussian forces launched a series of attacks against Ukrainian positions in the city of Sievierodonetsk, and were eventually able to capture the city.\n\n### Fall of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk\n\nIn late June 2022, Russian forces captured the city of Lysychansk, which is located in the Luhansk Oblast. The capture of the city marked a significant turning point in the conflict, as it gave Russian forces control over the entire Luhansk Oblast.\n\n## Russian operational pause (4–16 July 2022)\n\nFollowing the capture of Lysychansk, Russian forces paused their operations in the Donbas region. The pause was likely due to a combination of factors, including the need to regroup and resupply, as well as the difficulty of launching attacks in the summer heat.\n\n# Renewed assaults in Donetsk Oblast (17 July–6 September 2022)\n\n## Russian assaults near Bakhmut, Soledar, and Siversk\n\nRussian forces launched a series of attacks against Ukrainian positions near the cities of Bakhmut, Soledar, and Siversk, which are located in the Donetsk Oblast. The attacks were largely unsuccessful, but caused significant damage to the area.\n\n## Russian assaults near Avdiivka, Pisky, and Marinka\n\nRussian forces also launched attacks against Ukrainian positions near the cities of Avdiivka, Pisky, and Marinka, which are located in the Donetsk Oblast. The attacks were largely unsuccessful, but caused significant damage to the area.\n\n## Russian assaults near Sloviansk, Ukrainian counteroffensive\n\nRussian forces launched attacks against Ukrainian positions near the city of Sloviansk, which is located in the Donetsk Oblast. However, Ukrainian forces were able to launch a successful counterattack, and were able to retake significant territory in the area.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe battle of Donbas was one of the bloodiest and most destructive conflicts of the 21st century. The conflict resulted in significant human suffering, as well as widespread destruction of infrastructure and the environment.\n\n# Casualties\n\n## Military casualties\n\nEstimates of military casualties in the conflict vary widely, but it is believed that tens of thousands of Russian and Ukrainian troops were killed or wounded.\n\n## Civilian casualties\n\nEstimates of civilian casualties in the conflict also vary widely, but it is believed that tens of thousands of civilians were killed or wounded.\n\n# See also\n\n* War in Donbas\n* Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* Battle of Mariupol", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Battle_of_Donbas_(2022)\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##War in Donbas\n##Prior operations\n#Prelude\n##Russian objectives\n#Opposing forces and foreign involvement\n##Russian and pro-Russian forces\n##Ukrainian forces\n###Foreign support for Ukraine\n#Battle\n##Early operations (April–May 2022)\n###Popasna\n###Donetsk Oblast\n###Luhansk Oblast\n###Izium–Sloviansk front\n##Capture of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk, attempted advance on Sloviansk (May–July 2022)\n###Capture of Lyman and Sviatohirsk\n###Izium–Sloviansk front\n###Popasna–Bakhmut front\n###Sievierodonetsk front\n###Fall of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk\n##Russian operational pause (4–16 July 2022)\n#Renewed assaults in Donetsk Oblast (17 July–6 September 2022)\n##Russian assaults near Bakhmut, Soledar, and Siversk\n##Russian assaults near Avdiivka, Pisky, and Marinka\n##Russian assaults near Sloviansk, Ukrainian counteroffensive\n#Aftermath\n#Casualties\n##Military casualties\n##Civilian casualties\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The earthquake caused widespread damage and disruption, particularly in the provinces of Abra, Ilocos Sur, and Metro Manila. This article provides an overview of the earthquake's characteristics, impact, and response.\n\n# Earthquake\n\n## Characteristics\n\nThe 2022 Luzon earthquake occurred at 8:43 AM local time on July 27, 2022, with a magnitude of 7.0 on the Richter scale. The epicenter of the earthquake was located in the town of Tayum, Abra, at a depth of approximately 17 kilometers. The earthquake was classified as a shallow-focus event, which is typical of earthquakes that occur in the Philippines.\n\nThe earthquake was caused by the movement of the Philippine Fault Zone, a major transform fault that runs along the eastern edge of Luzon. The Philippine Fault Zone is a complex system of faults that is responsible for many of the earthquakes that occur in the Philippines.\n\n## Aftershocks\n\nFollowing the mainshock, a series of aftershocks were reported in the affected areas. The aftershocks were generally smaller in magnitude, ranging from 2.0 to 5.0 on the Richter scale. However, some aftershocks were strong enough to cause additional damage and disruption.\n\n## Intensity\n\nThe intensity of the earthquake was reported to be VIII (Very Strong) on the Philippine Intensity Scale (PEIS) in the provinces of Abra and Ilocos Sur. In Metro Manila, the intensity was reported to be V (Moderate) to VI (Strong). The earthquake was felt as far away as the Visayas and Mindanao regions.\n\n## Tsunami\n\nA tsunami warning was initially issued for the coastal areas of Luzon, but it was later lifted as no tsunami waves were detected. The Philippines is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, which makes it prone to tsunamis. However, the 2022 Luzon earthquake did not generate a significant tsunami threat.\n\n## Liquefaction\n\nReports of liquefaction were received from several areas, particularly in the provinces of Abra and Ilocos Sur. Liquefaction occurs when the shaking caused by an earthquake turns water-saturated soil into a liquid, causing buildings and other structures to collapse.\n\n# Response\n\nThe Philippine government responded quickly to the disaster, with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. declaring a state of calamity in the affected areas. The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) was activated to coordinate the response efforts.\n\n## International aid\n\nThe international community offered assistance to the Philippines, with several countries providing financial and humanitarian aid. The United States, China, and Japan were among the countries that provided assistance.\n\n# Impact\n\nThe 2022 Luzon earthquake had a significant impact on the affected areas, particularly in the provinces of Abra, Ilocos Sur, and Metro Manila.\n\n## Abra\n\nThe province of Abra was the hardest-hit area, with widespread damage reported in the towns of Tayum, Bangued, and Lagangilang. The earthquake caused the collapse of several buildings, including the Abra Provincial Hospital and the Tayum Municipal Hall.\n\n## Baguio\n\nThe city of Baguio was also affected by the earthquake, with several buildings and roads damaged. The city's famous Session Road was closed due to the collapse of a building.\n\n## Ilocos Sur\n\nThe province of Ilocos Sur reported significant damage, particularly in the towns of Vigan and Tagudin. The earthquake caused the collapse of several historic buildings, including the Vigan Cathedral.\n\n## Metro Manila\n\nMetro Manila experienced moderate to strong shaking, with several buildings and roads damaged. The earthquake caused disruptions to public transportation and business operations.\n\n## Elsewhere\n\nOther areas, including the provinces of Benguet, Mountain Province, and La Union, also reported damage and disruption.\n\n# Gallery\n\n* A building damaged by the earthquake in Abra\n* Rescue operations in Ilocos Sur\n* A road damaged by the earthquake in Metro Manila\n* Aftershocks being monitored by seismologists\n\n# See also\n\n* List of earthquakes in the Philippines\n* 1990 Luzon earthquake\n* 2013 Bohol earthquake\n\n# References\n\n* National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council.

He was best known as a member of the hip-hop trio Migos, alongside Quavo and Offset. Takeoff was a key contributor to the group's success, known for his unique flow and introspective lyrics.\n\n#Early life\n\nTakeoff was born on June 18, 1994, in Lawrenceville, Georgia, a suburb of Atlanta. He grew up in a musical family, with his mother and uncle both being involved in the music industry. Takeoff's early life was marked by struggles, with his family often facing financial difficulties. Despite these challenges, he found solace in music, particularly hip-hop, which would eventually become his career.\n\nTakeoff's interest in music was encouraged by his uncle, who introduced him to artists such as Lil Wayne and Gucci Mane. He began rapping at the age of 8 and quickly developed his skills, often performing at local talent shows and events. Takeoff's early experiences in music helped shape his style, which would later become a key component of Migos' sound.\n\n#Career\n\n##2008–2018: Early work with Migos\n\nTakeoff's music career began in 2008, when he formed Migos with his uncle Quavo and cousin Offset. The group gained popularity in the early 2010s, releasing several mixtapes and singles that showcased their unique blend of hip-hop and trap music. Takeoff's contributions to Migos were significant, with his introspective lyrics and melodic flow helping to set the group apart from other hip-hop acts.\n\nIn 2013, Migos released their breakthrough single \"Versace,\" which became a viral hit and helped establish the group as a major force in hip-hop. The song's success led to Migos signing with Quality Control Music and releasing their debut studio album, \"Yung Rich Nation,\" in 2015. Takeoff's performances on the album, particularly on tracks like \"One Time\" and \"Just for Tonight,\" helped cement his reputation as a talented young rapper.\n\nOver the next few years, Migos released several successful albums and singles, including \"Culture\" (2017) and \"Stir Fry\" (2017). Takeoff's contributions to these projects were significant, with his lyrics and vocals helping to drive the group's creative direction. Despite his growing success with Migos, Takeoff remained relatively low-key, preferring to focus on his music rather than seeking to draw attention to himself.\n\n##2018–2021: The Last Rocket and later Migos work\n\nIn 2018, Takeoff released his debut solo album, \"The Last Rocket.\" The album was a critical and commercial success, with many praising Takeoff's introspective lyrics and melodic flow. The album's lead single, \"Last Memory,\" was a particular standout, with Takeoff's emotive vocals and poignant lyrics showcasing his growth as an artist.\n\nFollowing the release of \"The Last Rocket,\" Takeoff returned to work with Migos, contributing to the group's fourth studio album, \"Culture III\" (2021). The album was a commercial success, with several tracks featuring Takeoff's vocals and lyrics. Despite the album's success, however, tensions within the group began to rise, with Takeoff and Quavo reportedly at odds over creative direction.\n\n##2022: Friction within Migos and Only Built for Infinity Links\n\nIn 2022, Migos announced that they would be taking a hiatus, with Takeoff and Quavo reportedly pursuing solo projects. Takeoff used this time to focus on his own music, releasing his second solo album, \"Only Built for Infinity Links,\" in October 2022. The album was a critical and commercial success, with many praising Takeoff's growth as an artist and his introspective lyrics.\n\nDespite the success of \"Only Built for Infinity Links,\" Takeoff's time in the spotlight was cut short. On November 1, 2022, he was shot and killed outside a bowling alley in Houston, Texas. The incident sent shockwaves through the hip-hop community, with many paying tribute to Takeoff's memory and legacy.\n\n#Legal issues\n\n##Georgia Southern University incident\n\nIn 2015, Takeoff was involved in an incident at Georgia Southern University, where he was scheduled to perform with Migos. The group's performance was cut short after a fight broke out in the crowd, with several people reportedly injured. Takeoff and the other members of Migos were subsequently arrested and charged with inciting a riot and possession of marijuana.\n\n##Sexual assault allegations\n\nIn 2020, Takeoff was accused of sexual assault by a woman who claimed that he had raped her at a party in Los Angeles. Takeoff denied the allegations, stating that the sex was consensual. The case was eventually dropped due to a lack of evidence.\n\n#Murder and trial\n\n##Reactions\n\nTakeoff's murder sent shockwaves through the hip-hop community, with many artists and fans paying tribute to his memory and legacy. Quavo and Offset, Takeoff's uncle and cousin, respectively, were particularly affected by his death, with both men taking to social media to express their grief.\n\n##Investigation and legal proceedings\n\nThe investigation into Takeoff's murder is ongoing, with several people reportedly being questioned by police. In December 2022, a man named Patrick Xavier Clark was arrested and charged with Takeoff's murder. Clark, who was reportedly a friend of Takeoff's, allegedly shot him after a dispute over a game of dice.\n\n##Funeral\n\nTakeoff's funeral was held on November 11, 2022, at the State Farm Arena in Atlanta, Georgia. The service was attended by several high-profile figures, including Quavo, Offset, and Drake. Takeoff was laid to rest at the Westview Cemetery in Atlanta.\n\n##Commercial impact\n\nTakeoff's death had a significant impact on the music industry, with several of his songs and albums experiencing a surge in popularity. \"Only Built for Infinity Links,\" his second solo album, debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart, with several tracks featuring Takeoff's vocals and lyrics.\n\n#Discography\n\n* \"The Last Rocket\" (2018)\n* \"Only Built for Infinity Links\" (2022)\n\n#See also\n\n* Migos\n* Quavo\n* Offset\n* Hip-hop music\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is a comprehensive overview of Takeoff's life and career.

The elections were originally scheduled for 2023, but President Aleksandar Vučić called for early elections to coincide with the constitutional referendum.\n\nBackground\n\n### Inter-party dialogues on electoral conditions\n\nIn 2021, the European Parliament and the United States embassy in Belgrade called for electoral reforms in Serbia to ensure free and fair elections. In response, the Serbian government initiated inter-party dialogues on electoral conditions, which resulted in the adoption of some reforms. However, opposition parties remained dissatisfied with the electoral environment, citing media bias, gerrymandering, and voter intimidation.\n\n### Constitutional referendum\n\nA constitutional referendum was held on January 16, 2022, to amend the Constitution of Serbia and reform the judiciary. The referendum was seen as a test of the government's popularity and a precursor to the general election. The outcome was a landslide victory for the government, with over 60% of voters supporting the amendments.\n\n### Environmental protests\n\nIn late 2021 and early 2022, Serbia experienced widespread environmental protests against lithium mining and other polluting activities.

She is the first person from the indigenous tribal communities to hold the office and the second woman to become the President of India. Murmu's life has been marked by her journey from a small village in Odisha to the highest constitutional position in the country.\n\n# Personal life\n\nDroupadi Murmu was born on June 20, 1958, in the village of Uparbeda, in the Mayurbhanj district of Odisha, India. She belongs to the Santal tribe, one of the largest indigenous tribal communities in India. Murmu's early life was marked by poverty and hardship, but she was determined to pursue her education. She completed her primary education in her village and later moved to Bhubaneswar to pursue her higher education. Murmu earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Ramadevi Women's College in Bhubaneswar.\n\nMurmu is married to Shyam Charan Murmu, a banker, and they have three children together. Her husband passed away in 2014. Murmu is known for her simple and humble lifestyle, and she has been a strong advocate for the rights of indigenous tribal communities.\n\n# Early career\n\nBefore entering politics, Murmu worked as a teacher at a primary school in her village. She later moved to the state capital, Bhubaneswar, where she worked as a junior assistant in the irrigation department of the Odisha government. Murmu's early career was marked by her determination to make a difference in her community. She was actively involved in social work and was a member of several organizations that worked for the welfare of indigenous tribal communities.\n\n# Political career\n\nMurmu's entry into politics was marked by her election as a councillor in the Rairangpur Notified Area Council in 1997. She later became the vice-president of the council and worked tirelessly to promote the development of her constituency. Murmu's leadership skills and her commitment to social work soon earned her recognition, and she became a prominent figure in Odisha politics.\n\nMurmu joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 2000 and quickly rose through the ranks. She became the president of the BJP's Scheduled Tribe Morcha in Odisha and later became a member of the BJP's national executive committee. Murmu's experience as a tribal leader and her commitment to social work made her a valuable asset to the BJP.\n\n# Governor of Jharkhand (2015–2021)\n\nIn 2015, Murmu was appointed as the Governor of Jharkhand, becoming the first woman to hold the office. Her tenure as Governor was marked by her commitment to promoting the development of the state and her advocacy for the rights of indigenous tribal communities.\n\n## Pathalgadi movement\n\nDuring her tenure as Governor, Murmu faced a major challenge in the form of the Pathalgadi movement, a tribal movement that sought to assert the rights of indigenous communities over their land and resources. The movement was marked by violence and protests, and Murmu played a key role in resolving the crisis through dialogue and negotiation.\n\n## Religion and land bill\n\nMurmu's tenure as Governor was also marked by controversy over the Jharkhand government's decision to amend the Chhotanagpur Tenancy Act and the Santhal Parganas Tenancy Act, two laws that protected the land rights of indigenous tribal communities. Murmu refused to give her assent to the amendments, citing concerns that they would harm the interests of tribal communities.\n\n# Presidential campaign\n\nIn 2022, Murmu was nominated as the BJP's candidate for the presidential election, becoming the first person from an indigenous tribal community to contest the election. Her campaign was marked by her emphasis on social welfare and her commitment to promoting the development of marginalized communities.\n\nMurmu's campaign was supported by several opposition parties, including the Aam Aadmi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party. Her election was seen as a significant moment in Indian politics, marking a shift towards greater representation and inclusion of marginalized communities.\n\n# Presidency (2022–present)\n\nMurmu was elected as the 15th President of India on July 21, 2022, defeating her opponent, Yashwant Sinha. Her inauguration marked a historic moment in Indian politics, with Murmu becoming the first person from an indigenous tribal community to hold the office.\n\nAs President, Murmu has emphasized the importance of social welfare and has committed to promoting the development of marginalized communities. She has also spoken out on issues such as climate change and environmental protection, highlighting the need for sustainable development and conservation.\n\n# Electoral performance\n\n| Year | Election | Party | Result |\n| 1997 | Rairangpur Notified Area Council election | BJP | Won |\n| 2000 | Odisha Legislative Assembly election | BJP | Lost |\n| 2004 | Odisha Legislative Assembly election | BJP | Won |\n| 2009 | Odisha Legislative Assembly election | BJP | Lost |\n| 2015 | Governor of Jharkhand | BJP | Nominated |\n| 2022 | Presidential election | BJP | Won |\n\n# State honours\n\nMurmu has received several state honours and awards for her contributions to social welfare and politics.

On August 12, 2022, Rushdie was stabbed on stage while giving a lecture at the Chautauqua Institution in Chautauqua, New York.\n\n# Background\n\nRushdie's novel \"The Satanic Verses\" was published in 1988 and sparked widespread outrage and protests in many Muslim-majority countries due to its depiction of the Prophet Muhammad and other Islamic figures. The book was banned in several countries, including Iran, India, and Pakistan. In 1989, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa, or Islamic edict, calling for Rushdie's death, which led to a significant increase in threats and attempts on his life.\n\nRushdie went into hiding and was placed under police protection in the UK. He continued to write and publish books, but the fatwa was not lifted until 1998, when the Iranian government announced that it would not support the fatwa, although it did not officially revoke it. Despite this, Rushdie has continued to face threats and criticism from some Muslim extremists.\n\n# Attack\n\nOn August 12, 2022, Rushdie was scheduled to give a lecture on the United States as a refuge for writers in exile at the Chautauqua Institution, a non-profit educational and cultural center in Chautauqua, New York. As he took the stage, a man rushed forward and stabbed him multiple times in the neck and torso. The attacker was quickly subdued by security personnel and audience members.\n\nRushdie was immediately taken to a nearby hospital, where he underwent emergency surgery. The attack was widely condemned by authors, politicians, and human rights organizations around the world.\n\n# Injuries and recovery\n\nRushdie suffered serious injuries in the attack, including a punctured lung, a damaged liver, and severe facial lacerations. He underwent multiple surgeries and was placed on a ventilator. After several days in the hospital, Rushdie was able to breathe on his own and was transferred to a rehabilitation center.\n\nRushdie's recovery was slow and arduous, but he was eventually able to return home and resume his writing and public appearances. The attack had a significant impact on Rushdie's physical and emotional well-being, but he has continued to speak out against censorship and violence.\n\n# Criminal investigation and prosecution\n\n## Suspect\n\nThe suspect in the attack was identified as Hadi Matar, a 24-year-old man from Fairview, New Jersey. Matar was arrested at the scene and charged with attempted murder and assault. He was later indicted on multiple counts of attempted murder, assault, and other charges.\n\nMatar's motive for the attack was reportedly his anger over Rushdie's writings and the perceived insult to Islam. Matar had been inspired by the Iranian Revolution and had become increasingly radicalized in the years leading up to the attack.\n\n# Response\n\n## United States\n\nThe attack on Rushdie was widely condemned by US politicians, authors, and human rights organizations. The US Department of State issued a statement denouncing the attack and expressing support for Rushdie and his family.\n\nThe attack also sparked a renewed debate about free speech and censorship in the US. Many authors and intellectuals spoke out in support of Rushdie and the importance of protecting free speech, even in the face of violence and intimidation.\n\n## Iran\n\nThe Iranian government was quick to distance itself from the attack, with the foreign ministry issuing a statement condemning the stabbing. However, some Iranian officials and media outlets praised the attacker and called for more violence against Rushdie and other perceived enemies of Islam.\n\n## Hezbollah\n\nHezbollah, a Shia Islamist militant group based in Lebanon, also praised the attacker and called for more violence against Rushdie and other perceived enemies of Islam.\n\n## Other nations\n\nThe attack on Rushdie was widely condemned by governments and human rights organizations around the world. The United Nations issued a statement denouncing the attack and expressing support for Rushdie and his family.\n\n# Cultural effect\n\nThe attack on Rushdie had a significant impact on the literary and cultural world. Many authors and intellectuals spoke out in support of Rushdie and the importance of protecting free speech, even in the face of violence and intimidation.\n\nThe attack also sparked a renewed debate about the role of literature and art in society, and the importance of protecting creative freedom.\n\n## Memoir\n\nRushdie has written a memoir about the attack and its aftermath, which is expected to be published in the near future. The memoir is expected to provide a detailed account of the attack and its impact on Rushdie's life and work.\n\n# Security at the Chautauqua Institution\n\nThe attack on Rushdie raised concerns about security at the Chautauqua Institution, which has a reputation for being a safe and welcoming place for authors and intellectuals.\n\nIn response to the attack, the institution has increased security measures, including the presence of armed guards and metal detectors. The institution has also implemented new protocols for handling threats and incendiary speech.\n\n# See also\n\n* The Satanic Verses\n* Fatwa\n* Censorship\n* Free speech\n* Literary criticism\n* Radicalization\n* Terrorism", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Stabbing_of_Salman_Rushdie\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Attack\n#Injuries and recovery\n#Criminal investigation and prosecution\n##Suspect\n#Response\n##United States\n##Iran\n##Hezbollah\n##Other nations\n#Cultural effect\n##Memoir\n#Security at the Chautauqua Institution\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "2022_Chinese_military_exercises_around_Taiwan", "content": "#Background\n##Incursions into Taiwan ADIZ\n##Escalation of tensions\n#Military exercises\n#Reactions\n##Japan\n##North Korea\n##Russia\n##United States\n#Aftermath\n#See also\n", "lang": "en", "article": "2022 Chinese Military Exercises Around Taiwan\n\nThe 2022 Chinese military exercises around Taiwan were a series of large-scale military drills conducted by the People's Liberation Army (PLA) of China in response to the visit of United States Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan in August 2022. The exercises were the largest and most provocative in recent years, involving all branches of the PLA and demonstrating China's growing military capabilities.\n\n# Background\n\n## Incursions into Taiwan ADIZ\n\nIn recent years, China has increased its military activities around Taiwan, including incursions into Taiwan's air defense identification zone (ADIZ). The ADIZ is an area where Taiwan requires incoming aircraft to identify themselves, and China's incursions into this zone have been seen as a way to test Taiwan's defenses and challenge its sovereignty. In 2020 and 2021, China's incursions into Taiwan's ADIZ increased significantly, with the PLA sending large numbers of aircraft into the zone on a regular basis.\n\n## Escalation of tensions\n\nTensions between China and Taiwan have been escalating in recent years, driven by a range of factors including China's increasing military power, Taiwan's growing sense of national identity, and the United States' shifting policy towards Taiwan. In 2020, China's leader Xi Jinping called for the \"reunification\" of Taiwan with China, and the PLA has been conducting regular military exercises in the Taiwan Strait. The visit of Speaker Pelosi to Taiwan in August 2022 was seen as a significant escalation of tensions, as China views any official contact between Taiwan and the United States as a challenge to its sovereignty.\n\n# Military Exercises\n\nThe 2022 Chinese military exercises around Taiwan were a series of large-scale drills conducted by the PLA in response to Speaker Pelosi's visit. The exercises began on August 4, 2022, and lasted for several days, involving all branches of the PLA including the army, navy, air force, and missile forces. The exercises included live-fire drills, amphibious landings, and missile launches, and were conducted in several locations around Taiwan including the Taiwan Strait, the East China Sea, and the South China Sea.\n\nThe exercises were notable for their scale and complexity, involving hundreds of aircraft, ships, and vehicles. The PLA also used advanced military technologies including stealth fighter jets, hypersonic missiles, and cyber warfare systems. The exercises were widely seen as a demonstration of China's growing military power and its ability to conduct complex, large-scale military operations.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## Japan\n\nJapan was one of the first countries to react to the 2022 Chinese military exercises around Taiwan. On August 4, 2022, Japan's Ministry of Defense issued a statement expressing \"grave concern\" about the exercises and calling on China to \"stop its military activities immediately\". Japan's Prime Minister, Fumio Kishida, also issued a statement saying that Japan would \"continue to work closely with the international community to maintain peace and stability in the region\".\n\n## North Korea\n\nNorth Korea was one of the few countries to publicly support China's military exercises around Taiwan. On August 5, 2022, North Korea's state media outlet KCNA issued a statement saying that the exercises were a \"legitimate and just measure\" to protect China's sovereignty.\n\n## Russia\n\nRussia's reaction to the 2022 Chinese military exercises around Taiwan was more muted. On August 5, 2022, Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement calling for \"restraint\" and \"dialogue\" to resolve the situation. However, Russia's President Vladimir Putin also issued a statement saying that Russia would \"continue to develop its strategic partnership with China\".\n\n## United States\n\nThe United States was one of the most vocal critics of the 2022 Chinese military exercises around Taiwan. On August 4, 2022, the US Department of State issued a statement saying that the exercises were \"a significant escalation\" and calling on China to \"cease its military activities immediately\". The US also deployed several warships to the Taiwan Strait, including the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier, in a show of support for Taiwan.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe 2022 Chinese military exercises around Taiwan had significant implications for regional security and the global balance of power. The exercises demonstrated China's growing military capabilities and its willingness to use force to defend its sovereignty. The exercises also highlighted the increasing tensions between China and the United States, and the need for greater dialogue and cooperation to prevent conflict.\n\nThe exercises also had significant implications for Taiwan, which has been seeking to strengthen its defenses and increase its international engagement in response to China's growing military power. The exercises highlighted the need for Taiwan to continue to develop its military capabilities and to strengthen its relationships with countries such as the United States and Japan.\n\n# See also\n\n* Cross-Strait relations\n* Taiwan Strait Crisis\n* China-Taiwan relations\n* United States-Taiwan relations\n* China-United States relations", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Chinese_military_exercises_around_Taiwan\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Incursions into Taiwan ADIZ\n##Escalation of tensions\n#Military exercises\n#Reactions\n##Japan\n##North Korea\n##Russia\n##United States\n#Aftermath\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

She is considered a symbol of French resistance and a Catholic saint. Born into a peasant family, Joan rose to prominence as a military leader and was eventually canonized as a saint. Her life and legacy have been the subject of numerous books, films, and artworks, cementing her place in history as one of the most famous women of all time.\n\n#Name\n\nJoan of Arc is often referred to as \"La Pucelle\" or \"The Maid of Orléans.\" The name \"Joan\" is the English version of the French name \"Jeanne,\" which was the name given to her at birth. \"Arc\" is the surname of her father, Jacques Arc. The name \"La Pucelle\" is a reference to her virginity, which was seen as a symbol of her purity and devotion to God.\n\n#Birth and historical background\n\nJoan of Arc was born on January 6, 1412, in the village of Domremy, which is located in the northeastern part of France. At the time of her birth, France was in the midst of the Hundred Years' War, a conflict that had been ongoing since 1337. The war was fought between the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of France, with the English seeking to expand their territory and the French fighting to defend their land.\n\n#Early life\n\nJoan was born into a peasant family. Her father, Jacques Arc, was a farmer, and her mother, Isabelle Romée, was a homemaker. Joan was the third of five children, and her family lived a simple life in the village of Domremy. As a child, Joan was raised in the Catholic faith and was taught by her mother the importance of prayer and devotion to God. She was also taught how to sew, spin, and manage a household, skills that were considered essential for a young woman at the time.\n\n#Chinon\n\nIn 1429, when Joan was 17 years old, she traveled to the town of Chinon, which is located in the Loire Valley. She had been hearing voices, which she believed were messages from God, telling her to drive the English out of France and to crown the Dauphin, Charles VII, as the rightful king of France. At Chinon, she met with Robert de Baudricourt, a French nobleman who was in charge of the garrison. She asked him to provide her with an escort to take her to the Dauphin, who was located in the city of Poitiers.\n\n#Military campaigns\n\nJoan's military campaigns began in 1429, when she traveled to the city of Orléans, which was under siege by the English. She led the French army to several victories, including the capture of the city of Orléans, the Battle of Jargeau, and the Battle of Patay.\n\n##Orléans\n\nThe siege of Orléans had been ongoing for over a year, and the city was on the verge of collapse. Joan arrived at the city in April 1429 and quickly took charge of the French army. She led the army to several victories, including the capture of the Tourelles, a fortress that was located on the opposite side of the Loire River. The English army retreated, and the city of Orléans was finally free from siege.\n\n##Loire Campaign\n\nAfter the capture of Orléans, Joan led the French army on a campaign to drive the English out of the Loire Valley. She led the army to several victories, including the Battle of Jargeau and the Battle of Meung-sur-Loire. The English army retreated, and the Loire Valley was finally free from English control.\n\n##Coronation and siege of Paris\n\nIn July 1429, Joan led the French army to the city of Reims, where Charles VII was crowned as the rightful king of France. The coronation was a major victory for the French, and it solidified Charles VII's claim to the throne.\n\nAfter the coronation, Joan led the French army to the city of Paris, which was under siege by the English. The French army was defeated, and Joan was captured by the English.\n\n##Campaign against Perrinet Gressart\n\nIn 1430, Joan led a campaign against Perrinet Gressart, a French nobleman who had allied himself with the English. The campaign was successful, and Gressart was forced to surrender.\n\n##Siege of Compiègne and capture\n\nIn May 1430, Joan led the French army to the city of Compiègne, which was under siege by the English. The French army was defeated, and Joan was captured by the English.\n\n#Trials and execution\n\nJoan's trial began in January 1431, when she was 19 years old. She was charged with heresy and witchcraft, and she was subjected to a lengthy and grueling trial.\n\n##Trial\n\nThe trial was held in the city of Rouen, which was under English control. Joan was interrogated by a panel of judges, who were determined to prove that she was a heretic and a witch. She was subjected to physical and mental torture, but she refused to recant her statements.\n\n##Execution\n\nOn May 30, 1431, Joan was led to the market square in the city of Rouen, where she was to be executed. She was burned at the stake, and her ashes were scattered in the Seine River.\n\n##Aftermath and rehabilitation trial\n\nAfter Joan's execution, there was widespread outrage in France. Many people believed that she had been wrongly accused and that her execution was a gross injustice.\n\nIn 1456, a rehabilitation trial was held, which cleared Joan's name and declared her innocent of all charges. She was declared a martyr and a saint, and she was canonized by the Catholic Church in 1920.\n\n#Visions\n\nJoan's visions were a key part of her religious experience. She believed that she received messages from God, which guided her actions and decisions. Her visions were often accompanied by voices, which she believed were the voices of saints and angels.\n\n#Clothing\n\nJoan's clothing was a key part of her identity as a military leader. She wore a suit of armor, which was a symbol of her bravery and strength. She also wore a white dress, which was a symbol of her purity and devotion to God.\n\n#Legacy\n\nJoan's legacy is complex and multifaceted. She is remembered as a military leader, a symbol of French resistance, and a Catholic saint.\n\n##Military leader and symbol of France\n\nJoan's military campaigns were a key part of her legacy. She led the French army to several victories, including the capture of the city of Orléans and the coronation of Charles VII. She is remembered as a brave and determined leader, who was willing to risk her life for her country.\n\n##Saint and heroic woman\n\nJoan's canonization as a saint in 1920 cemented her place in history as a heroic woman. She is remembered as a symbol of female empowerment and a role model for women around the world.\n\n#See also\n\n* Hundred Years' War\n* Charles VII of France\n* Catholic Church\n* Women in the military\n\n#References\n\n(Note: This section is not included as per the requirements)\n\n#External links\n\n(Note: This section is not included as per the requirements)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Joan_of_Arc\" following this outline:\n\n#Name\n#Birth and historical background\n#Early life\n#Chinon\n#Military campaigns\n##Orléans\n##Loire Campaign\n##Coronation and siege of Paris\n##Campaign against Perrinet Gressart\n##Siege of Compiègne and capture\n#Trials and execution\n##Trial\n##Execution\n##Aftermath and rehabilitation trial\n#Visions\n#Clothing\n#Legacy\n##Military leader and symbol of France\n##Saint and heroic woman\n#See also\n#References\n##Notes\n##Citations\n##Sources\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

From prehistoric times to the present day, the area has been shaped by numerous cultures, empires, and events that have left their mark on the landscape, people, and institutions of the county.\n\n# Roman and pre-Roman\n\nThe earliest known human presence in County Durham dates back to the Mesolithic period, around 8000 years ago. Archaeological evidence suggests that nomadic hunter-gatherer groups roamed the area, exploiting the natural resources of the land. As the Neolithic period dawned, around 4000 BC, farming communities began to settle and cultivate the land, leaving behind a legacy of ancient monuments and earthworks.\n\nThe Romans arrived in the area in the 1st century AD, and their presence had a profound impact on the region. They established the fort of Vinovia, near modern-day Binchester, which became a key stronghold in their conquest of northern England. The Romans also built the famous Dere Street, a major road that connected York to the Antonine Wall in Scotland, and which still forms the basis of the modern-day A1 road.\n\n# Anglo-Saxon\n\n## Anglian Kingdom of Bernicia\n\nFollowing the withdrawal of the Romans from Britain in the 5th century AD, the area that is now County Durham was settled by the Angles, a Germanic tribe from the continent. The Angles established the kingdom of Bernicia, which stretched from the Humber Estuary in the south to the Forth Estuary in the north. Bernicia was a powerful and influential kingdom that played a significant role in the development of Anglo-Saxon England.\n\n## Kingdom of Northumbria\n\nIn the 7th century, Bernicia merged with the neighboring kingdom of Deira to form the kingdom of Northumbria. Northumbria was a major power in Anglo-Saxon England, and its kingdom stretched from the Humber Estuary in the south to the Forth Estuary in the north. The kingdom was known for its rich cultural heritage, including its famous illuminated manuscripts, such as the Lindisfarne Gospels.\n\n# City of Durham founded\n\nIn 995 AD, a group of monks from the monastery of Lindisfarne, which had been destroyed by Viking raiders, established a new monastery on a rocky outcrop overlooking the River Wear. The monastery became the foundation of the city of Durham, which would go on to become a major center of learning, culture, and spirituality in medieval England.\n\n# Norman and Anglo-Norman\n\nThe Norman Conquest of England in 1066 had a profound impact on County Durham. The Normans introduced feudalism, which replaced the existing Anglo-Saxon system of government and land ownership. The Normans also built Durham Castle, which became a major stronghold in the north of England.\n\n# County Palatine of Durham\n\nIn the 12th century, the Bishop of Durham was granted the title of Earl Palatine, which gave him almost regal powers over the county. The County Palatine of Durham was a semi-autonomous state that existed within the kingdom of England, with its own system of government, laws, and institutions.\n\n## Boundaries, exclaves and population\n\nThe County Palatine of Durham had a complex system of boundaries and exclaves. The county was bounded by the kingdoms of Scotland to the north, and the counties of Yorkshire to the south, and Northumberland to the north. The county also had several exclaves, including the town of Bedlington, which was a detached part of the county that was surrounded by the county of Northumberland.\n\n## Survey\n\nIn the 12th century, the Bishop of Durham conducted a survey of the county, known as the Boldon Book, which recorded the landholdings, taxes, and population of the county. The survey provides valuable insights into the social and economic structure of the county during the Middle Ages.\n\n## Palatinate\n\nThe Palatinate of Durham was a powerful and influential institution that played a significant role in the government and administration of the county. The Palatinate was responsible for the collection of taxes, the administration of justice, and the defense of the county.\n\n## Wars\n\nCounty Durham played a significant role in several wars throughout its history, including the Wars of Scottish Independence, the English Civil War, and the Jacobite Risings. The county was also a major center of recruitment for the British Army during the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\n## Parliamentary representation and secular powers\n\nIn the 13th century, the County Palatine of Durham was represented in Parliament by two knights of the shire. The county also had several boroughs, including the city of Durham, which were represented by burgesses. The Palatinate of Durham had significant secular powers, including the right to appoint sheriffs, justices, and other officials.\n\n# Later government\n\nIn the 16th century, the County Palatine of Durham was abolished, and the county was brought under the direct control of the monarch. The county was governed by a lord lieutenant, who was responsible for the administration of justice, the collection of taxes, and the defense of the county.\n\n# Eighteenth century\n\nDuring the 18th century, County Durham underwent significant economic and social changes. The county became a major center of industry, with the development of coal mining, iron production, and textiles.

He was a founding member of the influential folk rock bands The Byrds and Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young (CSNY). Crosby's distinctive voice and guitar playing, as well as his songwriting skills, made him a key figure in the development of folk rock and the counterculture movement of the 1960s. With his warm, soothing voice and eclectic style, Crosby has had a successful music career spanning over five decades.\n\nEarly Years\n------------\n\nDavid Van Cortlandt Crosby was born on August 14, 1941, in Los Angeles, California, to Aliph Whitehead Crosby Jr. and his wife, Henrietta Nash. His father was a cinematographer, and his mother was a pianist and a poet. Crosby's early life was marked by a love for music, which was encouraged by his parents. He attended the Cate School in Carpinteria, California, and later enrolled at Santa Barbara City College. However, he dropped out of college to pursue a career in music.\n\nMusical Career\n----------------\n\n### The Byrds\n\nIn 1964, Crosby co-founded The Byrds with Chris Hillman, Roger McGuinn, Gene Clark, and Michael Clarke. The band's unique blend of folk, rock, and country music, combined with their distinctive vocal harmonies, made them an instant success. Crosby played rhythm guitar and sang lead vocals on many of the band's songs, including their hit singles \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" and \"Turn! Turn! Turn!\". However, his increasingly dominant personality and creative differences with the other band members led to his departure from the group in 1967.\n\n### Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young\n\nAfter leaving The Byrds, Crosby joined forces with Stephen Stills and Graham Nash to form Crosby, Stills & Nash (CSN). The trio's debut album, released in 1969, was a huge success, featuring hits like \"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes\" and \"Guinnevere\". The following year, Neil Young joined the group, and they became Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young (CSNY). The band's iconic performance at the 1969 Woodstock festival, as well as their hit single \"Ohio\", cemented their status as one of the most influential and successful bands of the era. However, internal conflicts and creative differences led to the band's breakup in 1970.\n\n### 1971–2022: Solo Career and Crosby & Nash\n\nCrosby released his debut solo album, \"If I Could Only Remember My Name\", in 1971. The album featured a more experimental and introspective style, showcasing Crosby's eclecticism and poetic songwriting. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Crosby released several solo albums, including \"Oh Yes I Can\" (1989) and \"Thousand Roads\" (1993). In 1972, he formed a duo with Graham Nash, releasing the album \"Graham Nash/David Crosby\".

Stewart's Banjo and Guitar Journal\n#References\n#External links\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Alfred A. Farland\n\nAlfred A. Farland was a renowned American banjo player, composer, and educator, best known for his significant contributions to the development and popularization of classical banjo music in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. With a career spanning over five decades, Farland was a pioneer in elevating the banjo from a folk instrument to a respected classical instrument, and his work continues to inspire banjo enthusiasts to this day.\n\n#Background\n\nAlfred A. Farland was born on July 18, 1864, in Boston, Massachusetts. His early life and musical training are not well-documented, but it is known that he began playing the banjo at a young age and quickly developed a passion for the instrument. Farland's family encouraged his musical pursuits, and he went on to study with some of the most prominent banjo players of his time.\n\n#Professional life\n\nFarland's professional career as a banjo player began in the late 1880s, during which time he performed with various musical ensembles and orchestras throughout the United States and Europe. He quickly gained recognition for his technical mastery and expressive playing style, which was characterized by its precision, clarity, and emotional depth.\n\nIn addition to his performance career, Farland was also a dedicated educator and composer. He taught banjo privately and at various music schools, and his compositions for the instrument are still widely performed and admired today. Farland's music was heavily influenced by classical and romantic traditions, and he was particularly drawn to the works of Chopin, Liszt, and Brahms.\n\n#Classical-music artist\n\nFarland's most significant contribution to the world of music was his efforts to establish the banjo as a legitimate classical instrument. At the time, the banjo was often viewed as a folk instrument, and it was not commonly featured in classical music performances. Farland sought to change this perception by composing and performing music that showcased the banjo's technical and expressive capabilities.\n\nFarland's classical banjo music was characterized by its complexity, nuance, and emotional depth. His compositions often featured intricate fingerpicking patterns, arpeggios, and chord progressions, which were designed to demonstrate the banjo's technical capabilities. At the same time, Farland's music was also deeply expressive and communicative, and it conveyed a sense of passion and intensity that resonated with audiences.\n\n#Marketing with his name\n\nFarland was also a skilled marketer and entrepreneur, and he used his name and reputation to promote the banjo and his own music. He was one of the first musicians to use his name as a brand, and he developed a distinctive logo and advertising style that helped to establish him as a leading figure in the world of banjo music.\n\nFarland's marketing efforts were highly successful, and he became one of the most famous banjo players of his time. His name and image were featured in numerous advertisements, and he was endorsed by several major banjo manufacturers. Farland's success helped to establish the banjo as a popular instrument, and it paved the way for future generations of banjo players.\n\n#American Banjo Fraternity\n\nIn 1895, Farland co-founded the American Banjo Fraternity, a organization dedicated to promoting the banjo and banjo music. The fraternity was established to provide a community for banjo players, composers, and enthusiasts, and it quickly grew to become one of the largest and most influential banjo organizations in the world.\n\nThe American Banjo Fraternity was instrumental in promoting Farland's music and legacy, and it continues to play an important role in the world of banjo music today. The fraternity publishes a journal, hosts conferences and festivals, and provides resources and support for banjo players and enthusiasts.\n\n#Works\n\n##Educational\n\nFarland wrote several instructional books and methods for the banjo, including \"The Farland Banjo Method\" and \"The Art of Banjo Playing\". These books provided a comprehensive guide to banjo technique and were widely used by students and teachers.\n\n##Sheet music\n\nFarland composed numerous works for the banjo, including solos, duets, and ensemble pieces. His music was published by several major music publishers, and it remains widely performed and admired today. Some of Farland's most famous compositions include \"The Banjo Fantasia\", \"The Whistling Coon\", and \"The Ragtime Dance\".\n\n#Gallery\n\nFarland was a prolific photographer and artist, and he created numerous images and illustrations that showcased his love of the banjo. His photographs and artwork were often featured in banjo magazines and journals, and they provide a unique glimpse into the world of banjo music during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\n#Examples in S.S. Stewart's Banjo and Guitar Journal\n\nFarland's music and writings were frequently featured in S.S. Stewart's Banjo and Guitar Journal, a leading music publication of the time. The journal published numerous articles and compositions by Farland, and it provided a platform for him to share his ideas and music with a wider audience.\n\n#References\n\n#External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Alfred_A._Farland\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Professional life\n#Classical-music artist\n#Marketing with his name\n#American Banjo Fraternity\n#Works\n##Educational\n##Sheet music\n#Gallery\n#Examples in S.S.

However, the 2023 floods were particularly severe, with some areas receiving over 200 mm of rainfall in a 24-hour period. The floods were caused by a combination of heavy rainfall, storm surges, and saturated soil. The region's geography, with its flat plains and numerous rivers, made it particularly vulnerable to flooding.\n\nThe floods began on April 10, 2023, and continued for several days, affecting various provinces in the region, including Bologna, Ferrara, and Ravenna. The city of Imola was particularly hard hit, with the River Santerno bursting its banks and inundating the city center. The floods caused widespread damage to homes, businesses, and infrastructure, with thousands of people displaced and many more affected.\n\n# Effects\n\nThe 2023 Emilia-Romagna floods had significant effects on various aspects of life in the region.\n\n## Emilia Romagna Grand Prix\n\nThe floods had a major impact on the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix, a Formula One racing event scheduled to take place at the Imola Circuit on April 16, 2023. The circuit was severely flooded, with the pit lane and paddock area under several feet of water. The event was eventually postponed to a later date, with the FIA and Formula One Management working to reschedule the race.\n\nThe postponement caused significant disruption to the Formula One calendar, with several teams and drivers expressing frustration at the decision. However, the safety of the drivers and teams was paramount, and the decision to postpone the event was widely understood.\n\n## Bruce Springsteen concert controversy\n\nThe floods also caused controversy surrounding a concert by Bruce Springsteen, scheduled to take place at the Stadio Renato Dall'Ara in Bologna on April 14, 2023. The concert was eventually canceled due to the flooding, with many fans expressing disappointment and frustration.\n\nHowever, some fans and local residents criticized Springsteen for not rescheduling the concert or offering refunds. The controversy highlighted the challenges faced by event organizers and performers in the face of natural disasters.\n\n# Reactions\n\nThe 2023 Emilia-Romagna floods prompted a range of reactions from government officials, local residents, and international organizations.\n\nThe Italian government declared a state of emergency in the affected regions, with Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni visiting the area to assess the damage. The government also announced a package of measures to support affected residents and businesses, including financial aid and tax relief.\n\nLocal residents expressed shock and sadness at the scale of the damage, with many praising the efforts of emergency responders and volunteers. However, some residents also criticized the government's response, arguing that more could have been done to prevent the floods and mitigate their impact.\n\nInternational organizations, including the European Union and the United Nations, offered support and assistance to the affected regions. The EU activated its Civil Protection Mechanism, which provides financial and logistical support to affected countries.\n\n# Humanitarian efforts\n\nThe 2023 Emilia-Romagna floods prompted a significant humanitarian response, with many organizations and individuals providing support to affected residents.\n\nThe Italian Red Cross played a major role in the response, providing emergency shelter, food, and medical care to thousands of people. The organization also worked to reunite families and provide psychological support to those affected.\n\nOther organizations, including the UNHCR and the World Food Programme, also provided support to affected residents. The UNHCR worked to provide emergency shelter and protection to vulnerable groups, including refugees and asylum seekers.\n\nIndividuals also played a significant role in the response, with many volunteering their time and resources to support affected residents. Social media platforms were used to coordinate relief efforts and raise awareness of the disaster.\n\n# See also\n\n* 2012 Northern Italy earthquakes\n* 2018 Liguria floods\n* 2019 Venice floods\n* List of natural disasters in Italy\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a stub.

He played a significant role in the early years of the communist regime in Romania, but his tenure was marked by controversy and ultimately ended in tragedy.\n\n#Biography\n\n##Early life\n\nȘtefan Foriș was born on May 22, 1892, in Gurbediu, a small village in the Hunedoara County of Transylvania, Romania. His family was of peasant origin, and his parents were both illiterate. Foriș's early education took place in the local village school, where he showed a keen interest in learning. He later attended the normal school in Deva, where he trained to become a teacher.\n\n##PCR outlawing\n\nIn 1921, Foriș joined the Romanian Communist Party (PCR), which was then an underground organization. The PCR had been outlawed by the Romanian government in 1924, and its members were subject to persecution and arrest. Foriș was arrested several times for his communist activities, but he continued to work for the party, becoming one of its leading figures in Transylvania.\n\n##\"Popular front\" tactic\n\nIn the mid-1930s, the PCR adopted the \"popular front\" tactic, which involved forming alliances with other left-wing parties and organizations to oppose the growing fascist movement in Romania. Foriș played a key role in implementing this tactic, working closely with other communist leaders, such as Ana Pauker and Vasile Luca.\n\n##Taking over\n\nIn 1940, Foriș became the general secretary of the PCR, following the death of the previous leader, Marcel Pauker. Foriș's appointment was seen as a compromise between different factions within the party, and he faced significant challenges in unifying the PCR's disparate groups.\n\n##Resisting the resistance\n\nDuring World War II, Romania allied itself with Nazi Germany, and the PCR was forced to go underground once again. Foriș played a key role in organizing the party's resistance to the fascist regime, but his efforts were hindered by internal conflicts and the PCR's limited resources.\n\n##Caransebeș conspiracy\n\nIn 1943, Foriș was accused of being involved in a conspiracy against the PCR leadership, known as the Caransebeș conspiracy. The conspiracy was allegedly led by a group of PCR members who were dissatisfied with Foriș's leadership and wanted to overthrow him. Foriș was arrested and interrogated, but he denied any involvement in the conspiracy.\n\n##Capture\n\nOn April 22, 1944, Foriș was captured by the Romanian authorities while attempting to flee to the Soviet Union. He was arrested and imprisoned, and his fate was sealed.\n\n##Killing\n\nOn May 3, 1944, Foriș was killed in prison, allegedly while attempting to escape. The circumstances of his death are still disputed, and many believe that he was murdered by his captors.\n\n#Legacy\n\n##Cover-up and rumors\n\nForiș's death was followed by a cover-up, and the circumstances of his killing were not made public until many years later. Rumors about his death circulated widely, with some claiming that he had been killed by the PCR itself, while others believed that he had been murdered by the Romanian authorities.\n\n##Rehabilitation\n\nIn the 1960s, Foriș's reputation was rehabilitated, and he was recognized as a hero of the Romanian communist movement. His contributions to the PCR and his role in the resistance against fascism were acknowledged, and he was celebrated as a martyr of the communist cause.\n\n#Personal life and family\n\nForiș was married to a woman named Maria, and they had two children together. Little is known about his personal life, but it is believed that he was a devoted family man and a passionate advocate for social justice.\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is based on available historical sources and is intended to provide a neutral and informative account of Ștefan Foriș's life and legacy.\n\n#References\n\n(No references are included in this version of the article)\n\n#External links\n\n(No external links are included in this version of the article)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Ștefan_Foriș\" following this outline:\n\n#Biography\n##Early life\n##PCR outlawing\n##\"Popular front\" tactic\n##Taking over\n##Resisting the resistance\n##Caransebeș conspiracy\n##Capture\n##Killing\n#Legacy\n##Cover-up and rumors\n##Rehabilitation\n#Personal life and family\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The documents provide insight into the company's content moderation practices, relationships with government agencies, and decision-making processes. The release of the Twitter Files has sparked significant debate and discussion about the role of social media in society, the limits of free speech, and the influence of government agencies on private companies.\n\n# Background\n\nThe Twitter Files were released by Elon Musk, who acquired Twitter in October 2022. Musk has stated that he wants to promote transparency and accountability at the company, and the release of the Twitter Files is part of this effort. The documents were initially released to a select group of journalists, who were given access to the company's internal communications and documents.\n\n# Topics\n\nThe Twitter Files cover a range of topics related to the company's content moderation practices, relationships with government agencies, and decision-making processes. Some of the key topics include:\n\n## No. 1: Content moderation of New York Post story\n\nOne of the documents released as part of the Twitter Files shows that the company's content moderation team removed a New York Post story about Hunter Biden from the platform in October 2020. The story reported on emails allegedly found on a laptop belonging to Hunter Biden, which suggested that he had engaged in corrupt activities. Twitter's content moderation team removed the story from the platform, citing concerns about hacked materials and election interference.\n\n## No. 2: Visibility filtering\n\nAnother document released as part of the Twitter Files shows that the company's content moderation team engaged in \"visibility filtering,\" which involves reducing the visibility of certain tweets or accounts on the platform. The document suggests that this practice was used to limit the reach of certain accounts, including those belonging to conservative politicians and pundits.\n\n## Nos. 3–5: Attack on the Capitol and suspension of Donald Trump\n\nThe Twitter Files also provide insight into the company's decision to suspend the account of Donald Trump following the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. The documents show that Twitter's content moderation team was concerned about Trump's tweets, which they believed were inciting violence and contributing to the unrest.\n\n## Nos. 6–7: FBI communications with Twitter Trust and Safety Team\n\nThe Twitter Files also reveal that the FBI communicated regularly with Twitter's Trust and Safety Team, which is responsible for content moderation on the platform. The documents show that the FBI provided Twitter with information about potential security threats and asked the company to remove certain content from the platform.\n\n## Nos. 8–9: Relationship with the U.S. government\n\nThe Twitter Files provide insight into Twitter's relationship with the U.S. government, including the company's interactions with law enforcement agencies and the intelligence community. The documents show that Twitter cooperated with the government on a range of issues, including national security and election integrity.\n\n## No. 10: Moderation of COVID-19 content\n\nThe Twitter Files also reveal how the company moderated content related to COVID-19, including misinformation about vaccines and treatments. The documents show that Twitter's content moderation team worked to remove false or misleading information from the platform, often in cooperation with public health officials.\n\n## No. 15: Hamilton 68 Dashboard\n\nThe Twitter Files also provide insight into the Hamilton 68 Dashboard, a tool developed by the Alliance for Securing Democracy to track Russian influence operations on social media. The documents show that Twitter was aware of the dashboard and its limitations, but continued to cooperate with the Alliance on issues related to election integrity.\n\n## No. 16: Insults directed to and from Donald Trump and other Republicans\n\nThe Twitter Files also reveal how Twitter's content moderation team handled insults and harassment directed at and from Donald Trump and other Republicans. The documents show that Twitter's policies on harassment and abuse were applied unevenly, often depending on the identity of the user.\n\n## No. 17: Global Engagement Center\n\nThe Twitter Files also provide insight into the Global Engagement Center, a U.S. government agency responsible for countering foreign propaganda and disinformation. The documents show that Twitter cooperated with the Center on issues related to election integrity and national security.\n\n## No. 19: The Virality Project\n\nThe Twitter Files also reveal how Twitter's content moderation team worked with the Virality Project, a research initiative focused on understanding the spread of misinformation on social media. The documents show that Twitter provided the Virality Project with access to its data and cooperated with the initiative on issues related to election integrity.\n\n# Reactions\n\nThe release of the Twitter Files has sparked significant debate and discussion about the role of social media in society, the limits of free speech, and the influence of government agencies on private companies.\n\n## Politicians\n\nPoliticians from both parties have reacted to the Twitter Files, with some calling for greater regulation of social media companies and others advocating for greater transparency and accountability.\n\n## FBI\n\nThe FBI has declined to comment on the Twitter Files, but has stated that it cooperates with private companies on issues related to national security and election integrity.\n\n## Legal scholars\n\nLegal scholars have debated the implications of the Twitter Files for free speech and the First Amendment, with some arguing that the government's influence on social media companies raises constitutional concerns.\n\n## Privacy and security\n\nPrivacy and security experts have raised concerns about the Twitter Files, citing the potential risks of government agencies accessing private data and the need for greater transparency and accountability.\n\n## Former Twitter CEO\n\nFormer Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has stated that he is concerned about the implications of the Twitter Files for free speech and the First Amendment, and has called for greater transparency and accountability at the company.\n\n## Journalists\n\nJournalists have reacted to the Twitter Files, with some calling for greater transparency and accountability at social media companies and others advocating for greater regulation of the industry.\n\n## Wikipedia article\n\nThe Wikipedia article on the Twitter Files has been edited extensively since the release of the documents, with some users adding information and others disputing the article's neutrality.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe release of the Twitter Files has sparked significant debate and discussion about the role of social media in society, the limits of free speech, and the influence of government agencies on private companies. The aftermath of the release will likely be felt for years to come, as policymakers, regulators, and the public grapple with the implications of the documents.\n\n# References\n\n# External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Twitter_Files\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Topics\n##No. 1: Content moderation of New York Post story\n##No. 2: Visibility filtering\n##Nos. 3–5: Attack on the Capitol and suspension of Donald Trump\n##Nos. 6–7: FBI communications with Twitter Trust and Safety Team\n##Nos. 8–9: Relationship with the U.S. government\n##No. 10: Moderation of COVID-19 content\n##No. 15: Hamilton 68 Dashboard\n##No. 16: Insults directed to and from Donald Trump and other Republicans\n##No. 17: Global Engagement Center\n##No. 19: The Virality Project\n#Reactions\n##Politicians\n##FBI\n##Legal scholars\n##Privacy and security\n##Former Twitter CEO\n##Journalists\n##Wikipedia article\n#Aftermath\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
