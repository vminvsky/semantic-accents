The crisis is characterized by a military coup that overthrew the democratically elected government, followed by a series of events that have led to a severe deterioration of the security situation in the country.\n\n# Background\n\n## ECOWAS\n\nThe Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has played a significant role in the crisis. ECOWAS is a regional economic community that aims to promote economic integration and cooperation among its member states. Niger is a member of ECOWAS, and the organization has been involved in efforts to resolve the crisis.\n\n## Security Situation\n\nThe security situation in Niger has been deteriorating for several years, with the country facing threats from armed groups, including Boko Haram and the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS). The country has also been affected by the Sahel conflict, which has led to a significant increase in violence and instability in the region.\n\n# Timeline\n\n## July\n\n### 29 July\n\nThe crisis began on July 29, 2023, when a group of military officers announced that they had seized power in a coup. The officers, who called themselves the National Council for the Safeguard of the Homeland (CNSP), said that they had taken control of the government and the country's institutions.\n\n### 30 July\n\n#### ECOWAS Ultimatum and Sanctions\n\nOn July 30, 2023, ECOWAS issued an ultimatum to the CNSP, demanding that they restore the democratically elected government within 15 days. ECOWAS also imposed sanctions on Niger, including the closure of the country's borders and the suspension of all economic and financial transactions.\n\n#### Pro-Coup Demonstrations in Niamey\n\nDespite the ECOWAS ultimatum, thousands of people took to the streets in Niamey, the capital city of Niger, to demonstrate in support of the CNSP. The protesters, who were largely made up of young people, chanted slogans in support of the military and called for the departure of the ousted president.\n\n### 31 July\n\nThe CNSP announced the establishment of a new government, with a military officer as the head of state.

Open science is a movement that seeks to make scientific research, data, and dissemination accessible to all, with the aim of accelerating scientific progress and improving societal outcomes. The economics of open science is a multidisciplinary field that draws on concepts from economics, sociology, and science studies to understand the economic implications of open science.\n\n# Economic models\n\nEconomic models are essential for understanding the economics of open science. These models provide a framework for analyzing the production, distribution, and consumption of scientific knowledge in an open science environment.\n\n## Open science club\n\nThe concept of an open science club is central to the economics of open science. An open science club is a group of individuals or organizations that share a common goal of advancing scientific knowledge through open and collaborative research.\n\n### Definitions of knowledge club\n\nA knowledge club is a group of individuals or organizations that share knowledge and expertise in a particular field. Knowledge clubs can be formal or informal and can take many different forms, including research networks, collaborations, and consortia.\n\n### Knowledge club and open science\n\nIn the context of open science, a knowledge club is a group of researchers who share a common goal of advancing scientific knowledge through open and collaborative research. Open science clubs can take many different forms, including online communities, research networks, and collaborations.\n\n## Open Science market\n\nThe open science market refers to the market for scientific research, data, and dissemination in an open science environment. The open science market is characterized by a number of distinct features, including a hybrid market structure, diversification of revenue streams, and a shift from readers to authors.\n\n### Scientific publishing: a hybrid market\n\nThe scientific publishing market is a hybrid market, meaning that it combines elements of both public and private goods. Scientific research is a public good, as it is non-rivalrous and non-excludable, but the dissemination of research results through publishing is a private good, as it is excludable and rivalrous.\n\n### From readers to authors: hybrid and full open access\n\nThe open science movement has led to a shift from readers to authors in the scientific publishing market. Hybrid open access models, which allow authors to pay for open access to their articles, have become increasingly popular, as have full open access models, which make all research articles openly available.\n\n### From publishing to analytics: diversification of revenue streams\n\nThe open science market has also seen a diversification of revenue streams, as publishers and other stakeholders seek to capitalize on the growing demand for open science. Analytics and data services have become increasingly important, as researchers seek to make sense of the growing volume of scientific data.\n\n## Open Science Commons\n\nThe open science commons refers to the shared knowledge and resources that are available to all in an open science environment. The open science commons is characterized by a number of distinct features, including the emergence of digital knowledge commons, enclosures of open science commons, and consolidation of the common ecosystem.\n\n### The emergence of digital knowledge commons\n\nThe emergence of digital technologies has led to the creation of new forms of knowledge commons, including online repositories, data archives, and collaboration platforms. These digital knowledge commons have made it possible for researchers to share knowledge and resources on a global scale.\n\n### Enclosures of open science commons\n\nDespite the growth of the open science commons, there are also efforts to enclose and restrict access to scientific knowledge. Patents, copyrights, and other forms of intellectual property protection can limit access to scientific knowledge and create barriers to collaboration.\n\n### Consolidation of the common ecosystem (2015-)\n\nIn recent years, there has been a trend towards consolidation of the open science ecosystem, as large corporations and other stakeholders seek to capitalize on the growing demand for open science. This consolidation has raised concerns about the future of the open science movement and the potential for unequal access to scientific knowledge.\n\n# Cost\n\nThe cost of open science is a critical issue, as researchers and institutions seek to make scientific knowledge more widely available. There are a number of different costs associated with open science, including editorial work and evaluation, technical infrastructure, and commercial services and prestige.\n\n## Editorial work and evaluation\n\nEditorial work and evaluation are essential components of the scientific publishing process, but they can be time-consuming and costly. Open science models often rely on volunteer editors and peer reviewers, which can help to reduce costs.\n\n## Technical infrastructure\n\nThe technical infrastructure required to support open science can be significant, including servers, software, and other equipment. However, the cost of technical infrastructure can be reduced through the use of cloud computing and other digital technologies.\n\n## Commercial services and prestige\n\nCommercial services, such as publishing and data analytics, can be an important source of revenue for open science initiatives. However, the pursuit of prestige and reputation can also drive up costs, as researchers and institutions seek to establish themselves as leaders in their fields.\n\n# Benefits\n\nThe benefits of open science are numerous, including reduced transaction costs, access costs, and increased research efficiency. Open science can also contribute to economic and social development, as scientific knowledge is made more widely available.\n\n## Transaction costs\n\nOpen science can reduce transaction costs, as researchers and institutions are able to share knowledge and resources more easily. This can lead to increased collaboration and innovation, as well as reduced costs for publication and dissemination.\n\n## Access costs\n\nOpen science can also reduce access costs, as scientific knowledge is made more widely available. This can be particularly beneficial for researchers in developing countries, who may not have access to expensive journals and databases.\n\n## Research efficiency\n\nOpen science can increase research efficiency, as researchers are able to build on each other's work more easily. This can lead to faster breakthroughs and discoveries, as well as increased productivity.\n\n## Economic and social development\n\nOpen science can contribute to economic and social development, as scientific knowledge is made more widely available. This can lead to increased innovation and entrepreneurship, as well as improved health and well-being.\n\n# Economic regulation of open science\n\nEconomic regulation of open science is an important issue, as governments and other stakeholders seek to promote open science while also protecting intellectual property and other economic interests. There are a number of different regulatory approaches, including open access mandates, funding for open science initiatives, and tax incentives for open science research.\n\nIn conclusion, the economics of open science is a complex and multifaceted field, with a number of different economic models, costs, benefits, and regulatory approaches. As the open science movement continues to grow and evolve, it is essential to understand the economic implications of open science and to develop policies and practices that promote openness, collaboration, and innovation.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Economics_of_open_science\" following this outline:\n\n#Economic models\n##Open science club\n###Definitions of knowledge club\n###Knowledge club and open science\n##Open Science market\n###Scientific publishing: a hybrid market\n###From readers to authors: hybrid and full open access\n###From publishing to analytics: diversification of revenue streams\n##Open Science Commons\n###The emergence of digital knowledge commons\n###Enclosures of open science commons\n###Consolidation of the common ecosystem (2015-)\n#Cost\n##Editorial work and evaluation\n##Technical infrastructure\n##Commercial services and prestige\n#Benefits\n##Transaction costs\n##Access costs\n##Research efficiency\n##Economic and social development\n#Economic regulation of open science\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The ceremony was originally scheduled for January 31, 2022, but was postponed due to concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic. The event was hosted by Trevor Noah, marking his second consecutive year as host.\n\n# Background\n\n## Category changes\n\nThe Recording Academy announced several changes to the award categories for the 64th Annual Grammy Awards. The number of categories was reduced from 84 to 78, with some categories being merged or eliminated. The changes were made to reflect the evolving music industry and to improve the voting process.\n\n## Nomination changes\n\nThe nomination process was also modified, with the number of nominees in each category increasing from five to ten. This change was made to provide more opportunities for artists to be recognized and to reflect the diversity of the music industry.\n\n## Voting changes\n\nThe voting process was also changed, with the addition of a new voting system. The system, known as the \"peer-based\" voting system, allows voters to select their top choices in each category, rather than ranking their choices.\n\n## Nomination withdrawals\n\nSeveral artists withdrew their nominations from consideration, citing concerns over the voting process and the lack of diversity among the nominees. The withdrawals were made in an effort to bring attention to the issues and to promote change within the industry.\n\n## Postponement and relocation\n\nThe ceremony was originally scheduled for January 31, 2022, but was postponed due to concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic. The event was later relocated from the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles to the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\n# Performers\n\n## Premiere ceremony\n\nThe premiere ceremony, which honored winners in the non-televised categories, featured performances by several artists, including Arlo Parks, Saweetie, and Ledisi.\n\n## Main ceremony\n\nThe main ceremony featured performances by several high-profile artists, including Olivia Rodrigo, Lil Nas X, and Brandi Carlile. The ceremony also included a tribute to the late Stephen Sondheim, featuring performances by Cynthia Erivo, Leslie Odom Jr., and Ben Platt.\n\n# Presenters\n\nThe ceremony featured a number of presenters, including Lady Gaga, Chris Stapleton, and Questlove.

Free\n\nKarl R. Free was an American artist, best known for his work on post office murals in the 1930s. As an assistant curator at the Whitney Museum, Free played a significant role in promoting American art and artists. His post office murals, commissioned by the Treasury Department's Section of Fine Arts, were intended to bring art to the masses and showcase American culture. However, some of his works were met with controversy and objections, reflecting the complexities of artistic expression and community values.\n\n#Early years\n\nKarl R. Free was born in the late 19th century, and his early life and education are not well-documented. However, it is known that he developed an interest in art at an early age and pursued a career in the field. Free's early work was likely influenced by the artistic movements of the time, including American Regionalism and Social Realism. These styles emphasized the importance of depicting everyday American life and the experiences of ordinary people.\n\n#Whitney Museum assistant curator\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, Free worked as an assistant curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City. During his tenure, the museum focused on promoting American art and artists, with a particular emphasis on modern and contemporary works. As an assistant curator, Free was responsible for organizing exhibitions, acquiring new works for the museum's collection, and supporting emerging artists.\n\nFree's work at the Whitney Museum helped to establish him as a prominent figure in the American art world. His expertise and connections likely played a role in his later selection as a post office mural artist.\n\n#Post office murals\n\nIn the 1930s, the Treasury Department's Section of Fine Arts commissioned Karl R. Free to create murals for post offices in Washington, D.C. and Princeton, New Jersey. These works were part of a larger effort to bring art to the masses and decorate public buildings.\n\n##Washington, D.C.\n\n###Creation\n\nFree's mural for the Washington, D.C. post office, titled \"The History of the Mail,\" depicted scenes from the history of the postal service. The work featured prominent figures, including Benjamin Franklin and George Washington, as well as everyday Americans engaged in postal activities. The mural was intended to celebrate the importance of the postal service in American life.\n\n###Reception and objections\n\nWhile \"The History of the Mail\" was widely praised for its artistic merit, some viewers objected to the depiction of African Americans in the mural. The work included a small image of a slave delivering mail, which some saw as perpetuating negative stereotypes. Others felt that the mural did not adequately represent the contributions of African Americans to the postal service.\n\n##Princeton, New Jersey\n\n###Creation\n\nFree's mural for the Princeton, New Jersey post office, titled \"The Industries of Princeton,\" showcased the town's economic and cultural activities. The work featured scenes of Princeton's famous university, as well as its manufacturing and agricultural industries.\n\n###Reception and objections\n\n\"The Industries of Princeton\" was met with controversy over its depiction of the town's African American community. Some viewers felt that the mural perpetuated stereotypes and did not accurately represent the experiences of African Americans in Princeton. Others objected to the inclusion of a scene showing a Princeton University professor lecturing to a group of African American students, which some saw as condescending.\n\n#1939 and beyond\n\nKarl R. Free's work on post office murals ended in the late 1930s, as the Treasury Department's Section of Fine Arts was disbanded.

The mission is a follow-up to the Chandrayaan-2 mission, which aimed to demonstrate the ability to soft-land on the lunar surface but unfortunately failed to do so. Chandrayaan-3 aims to achieve this goal and expand on the scientific objectives of its predecessor. The mission is a significant milestone in India's space program, marking the country's second attempt at a soft lunar landing.\n\n# History\n\nChandrayaan-3 was first proposed in 2019, shortly after the failure of the Chandrayaan-2 mission. The ISRO quickly began working on a new mission, incorporating lessons learned from the previous attempt. The spacecraft design and development process were accelerated, with a focus on achieving a successful soft landing on the lunar surface.\n\n# Objectives\n\nThe primary objectives of the Chandrayaan-3 mission are:\n\n* To demonstrate the ability to soft-land on the lunar surface\n* To conduct scientific experiments on the lunar surface\n* To expand on the understanding of the lunar geology, composition, and atmosphere\n* To test new technologies and strategies for future lunar missions\n\n# Spacecraft\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft consists of three main components: the Propulsion Module, the Vikram lander, and the Pragyan rover.\n\n## Design\n\nThe spacecraft design is based on the Chandrayaan-2 mission, with several modifications and improvements.\n\n### Propulsion Module\n\nThe Propulsion Module is the main spacecraft component, responsible for propelling the lander and rover to the lunar surface. It is equipped with a liquid-fueled engine and a navigation system.\n\n### Vikram Lander\n\nThe Vikram lander is a separate module that separates from the Propulsion Module and descends to the lunar surface. It is equipped with a retro-propulsion system, a navigation system, and a communication system.\n\n### Rover Pragyan\n\nThe Pragyan rover is a small, six-wheeled robotic vehicle that is carried by the Vikram lander to the lunar surface.

Koufax is widely regarded as one of the greatest pitchers in baseball history, known for his blazing fastball, sharp curveball, and pinpoint control. He is a three-time Cy Young Award winner, four-time World Series champion, and seven-time All-Star.\n\n#Early life\n\nSandy Koufax was born on December 30, 1935, in Brooklyn, New York, to Evelyn and Jack Koufax. His father was an attorney who later became a successful businessman. Koufax grew up in a Jewish family and was raised in the Borough Park section of Brooklyn. He developed an interest in sports at an early age and played basketball and baseball in high school.\n\n##Major League tryouts\n\nAfter graduating from Lafayette High School in 1953, Koufax attended the University of Cincinnati on a basketball scholarship. However, he soon dropped out of college to pursue a career in baseball. In 1954, Koufax tried out for the New York Giants, but was not offered a contract. He then tried out for the Pittsburgh Pirates, but was again unsuccessful. Koufax's big break came when he was spotted by Al Campanis, a scout for the Brooklyn Dodgers, who signed him to a contract in 1954.\n\n#Professional career\n\n##Early years (1955–1960)\n\nKoufax made his major league debut on June 24, 1955, for the Brooklyn Dodgers. He struggled in his early years, posting a 42-53 record with a 4.10 ERA. Despite his struggles, Koufax showed flashes of brilliance, striking out 262 batters in 1959.\n\n##Domination (1961–1964)\n\n###1961 season\n\nIn 1961, Koufax's career took a dramatic turn. He went 18-13 with a 3.09 ERA, striking out 269 batters. Koufax's performance earned him his first All-Star selection and a fourth-place finish in the Cy Young Award voting.\n\n###1962 season\n\nKoufax continued to dominate in 1962, going 14-7 with a 2.54 ERA. He struck out 216 batters and was named to his second All-Star team.\n\n###1963 season\n\nIn 1963, Koufax had his best season to date, going 25-5 with a 1.88 ERA. He struck out 306 batters and was named the National League Cy Young Award winner.\n\n##Salary dispute\n\n###1964 season\n\nKoufax's salary dispute with the Dodgers made headlines in 1964. Koufax, who was making $35,000, demanded a significant raise. The Dodgers offered him a $50,000 contract, but Koufax held out for more. He eventually signed a one-year deal worth $75,000.\n\n##Playing in pain (1965–66)\n\n###1965 season\n\n####Perfection\n\nOn September 9, 1965, Koufax pitched a perfect game against the Chicago Cubs, striking out 14 batters. It was the first perfect game in Dodgers history and the eighth in major league history.\n\n####World Series and Yom Kippur decision\n\nKoufax's decision to sit out Game 1 of the 1965 World Series against the Minnesota Twins on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, made headlines. Koufax's decision was seen as a defining moment in his career and a testament to his commitment to his faith.\n\n##Holdout\n\n###1966 season\n\nKoufax's salary dispute with the Dodgers continued in 1966. He held out for several weeks, eventually signing a one-year deal worth $125,000.\n\n##Retirement\n\nKoufax retired from baseball on November 18, 1966, at the age of 30, due to chronic arthritic pain in his left elbow. He finished his career with a 165-87 record, a 2.76 ERA, and 2,396 strikeouts.\n\n#Career overall\n\n##Statistics and achievements\n\nKoufax's career statistics include a 165-87 record, a 2.76 ERA, and 2,396 strikeouts. He was a three-time Cy Young Award winner, four-time World Series champion, and seven-time All-Star.\n\n##Pitching style and repertoire\n\nKoufax was known for his blazing fastball, sharp curveball, and pinpoint control. He was a master of the strike zone, with a career strikeout-to-walk ratio of 3.97. Koufax's pitching style was characterized by his high leg kick and smooth delivery.\n\n#Post-playing activities\n\nAfter his retirement, Koufax went on to become a successful businessman and entrepreneur. He has been involved in various business ventures, including real estate and broadcasting.\n\n#Honors and recognition\n\nKoufax was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1972, at the age of 36. He was named the National League's Most Valuable Player in 1963 and was a three-time Cy Young Award winner.\n\n#Legacy\n\n##Impact within the Jewish community\n\nKoufax's impact on the Jewish community cannot be overstated. He was a hero and a role model for Jewish kids growing up in the 1950s and 1960s. His decision to sit out Game 1 of the 1965 World Series on Yom Kippur was seen as a defining moment in his career and a testament to his commitment to his faith.\n\n##Relationship with fellow minorities\n\nKoufax was a close friend and mentor to Don Newcombe, the first African American player to win a Cy Young Award. Koufax was also a vocal supporter of the Civil Rights Movement, and he used his platform to speak out against racism and inequality.\n\n#In media culture\n\n##Television appearances\n\nKoufax made several television appearances during his career, including a guest spot on the popular sitcom \"The Dick Van Dyke Show.\"\n\n##Cultural references\n\nKoufax has been referenced in popular culture, including in films, literature, and music.

In an interview, SZA revealed that she had written many of the album's songs in isolation, drawing inspiration from her personal experiences and emotions.\n\n#Composition\n\nMusically, SOS is a diverse and experimental album that blends elements of R&B, hip-hop, rock, and electronic music. The album features a range of instrumentation, including guitars, bass, and synthesizers, along with SZA's signature soulful vocals. Lyrically, the album explores themes of love, heartbreak, and self-discovery, with SZA delivering introspective and emotionally charged performances.\n\n#Title and artwork\n\nThe title SOS is an acronym for \"Sisters Only Squad,\" a phrase that SZA has used to describe her close-knit group of female friends and collaborators.

The image shows SZA posing in a red swimsuit, surrounded by water, and has been interpreted as a symbol of rebirth and transformation.\n\n#Promotion\n\nSOS was promoted through a series of singles and music videos, including \"Good Days,\" \"I Hate U,\" and \"Nobody Gets Me.\" The album's release was also accompanied by a series of promotional events, including a live performance on Saturday Night Live and a concert at the iconic Madison Square Garden.

With a career spanning over five decades, she has established herself as one of the most successful and beloved artists of all time. Newton-John's music and film career has been marked by numerous chart-topping hits, iconic movie roles, and a commitment to philanthropy and advocacy.\n\nEarly Life and Family\n--------------------\n\nOlivia Newton-John was born on September 26, 1948, in Cambridge, England, to Brinley Newton-John and Irene Born. Her father was a Welsh-born professor of German, and her mother was an Australian-born daughter of a Nobel Prize-winning mathematician. Newton-John has two siblings, Hugh and Rona, and the family moved to Melbourne, Australia, when she was six years old. She developed an early interest in music and began taking singing lessons at the age of nine.\n\nCareer\n-------\n\n### Career Beginnings\n\nNewton-John's music career began in the late 1960s, when she formed a girl group called Sol Four with her friends. The group performed on local television shows and at parties, but eventually disbanded. In 1966, Newton-John won a talent contest on a local television show, which led to her being signed by Decca Records. She released her debut single, \"Till You Say You'll Be Mine,\" in 1966, but it failed to chart.\n\n### 1971–1974: Early Success\n\nNewton-John's breakthrough came in 1971, when she released her debut album, \"If Not for You,\" which was produced by John Farrar. The album was a moderate success in Australia, but it was her 1971 single \"If Not for You\" that brought her international attention. The song was a cover of a Bob Dylan track and became a hit in the United States, reaching the top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Newton-John's subsequent albums, \"Olivia\" (1972) and \"Let Me Be There\" (1973), solidified her position as a rising star in the music industry.\n\n### 1975–1977: Have You Never Been Mellow, Clearly Love, and Continued Success\n\nIn 1975, Newton-John released the album \"Have You Never Been Mellow,\" which spawned the hit singles \"Have You Never Been Mellow\" and \"Please Mr. Please.\" The album was a huge commercial success, reaching number one on the US Billboard 200 chart and earning Newton-John her first Grammy Award. Her subsequent albums, \"Clearly Love\" (1975) and \"Come On Over\" (1976), continued her string of hits, with songs like \"Let It Shine\" and \"Come On Over.\"\n\n### 1978–1979: Grease and Totally Hot\n\nNewton-John's biggest break came in 1978, when she was cast as Sandy Olsson in the musical film \"Grease,\" opposite John Travolta.

The soundtrack to the film, which featured Newton-John's hit singles \"You're the One That I Want\" and \"Hopelessly Devoted to You,\" became one of the best-selling soundtracks of all time. Newton-John's subsequent album, \"Totally Hot\" (1978), was a commercial success, but received mixed reviews from critics.\n\n#### Lawsuit against MCA Records\n\nIn 1979, Newton-John sued MCA Records, claiming that the label had not paid her royalties on time. The lawsuit was eventually settled out of court, but it led to a public feud between Newton-John and the label.\n\n### 1980–1988: Physical, Soul Kiss, and The Rumour\n\nNewton-John's next album, \"Physical\" (1981), was a huge commercial success, spawning the hit singles \"Physical\" and \"Make a Move on Me.\" The album was certified multi-platinum and became one of the best-selling albums of the 1980s.

She took a break from her music career to focus on motherhood, but continued to perform and record music. In 1992, Newton-John was diagnosed with breast cancer, which led to her becoming a prominent advocate for cancer research and awareness. She underwent treatment and made a full recovery, but continued to be open about her experiences with cancer.\n\n### 1998–2012: Later Releases\n\nNewton-John's music career continued with the release of the album \"Back with a Heart\" (1998), which featured the hit single \"I Honestly Love You.\" She released several more albums, including \"One Woman's Live Journey\" (2000) and \"Indigo: Women of Song\" (2004), which featured covers of songs by female artists.\n\n### 2012–2022: Vegas Residency and Final Releases\n\nIn 2012, Newton-John began a residency at the Flamingo Las Vegas, which ran for several years. She released the album \"A Celebration in Song\" (2012), which featured duets with other artists, and \"LIV ON\" (2016), which featured songs about overcoming adversity. Newton-John's final studio album, \"Unforgettable\" (2020), was a collection of cover songs.\n\nIn the Media\n-------------\n\nNewton-John has been featured in numerous films and television shows, including \"Grease,\" \"Xanadu,\" \"Two of a Kind,\" and \"Glee.\" She has also appeared on various reality TV shows, including \"Dancing with the Stars\" and \"The Apprentice.\"\n\nMusical Legacy\n----------------\n\nNewton-John's music career has had a lasting impact on the industry.

The suspensions targeted various accounts, including those of journalists, flight-tracking services, and other users. The incident drew significant attention and raised concerns about Twitter's moderation policies and the role of its owner, Elon Musk.\n\n#Background\n\nIn October 2022, Elon Musk acquired Twitter for approximately $44 billion. Following the acquisition, Musk announced plans to reform Twitter's moderation policies, which he believed were too restrictive. He also stated his intention to promote free speech on the platform. However, the changes implemented by Musk were met with criticism from various groups, including journalists, activists, and politicians.\n\n#Account suspensions\n\n##Twitter policy changes\n\nIn early December 2022, Twitter updated its policies to prohibit the sharing of \"live location information\" and \"links to third-party URL(s) of travel routes in real-time.\" The changes were seen as an attempt to restrict the sharing of information about the location of private jets, including those owned by Musk.\n\n##Suspension of flight-tracking accounts\n\nOn December 14, 2022, Twitter suspended several accounts that tracked the location of private jets, including those owned by Musk. The accounts, which used publicly available data to track the flights, were accused of violating Twitter's new policies. The suspensions were seen as an attempt to conceal information about Musk's private jet movements.\n\n##Suspension of journalist accounts\n\nOn December 15, 2022, Twitter suspended the accounts of several journalists who had covered Musk and Twitter. The journalists, who worked for various news organizations, were accused of violating Twitter's policies. However, many saw the suspensions as an attempt to silence critics of Musk and Twitter.\n\n##Explanation from Twitter and Musk\n\nTwitter and Musk defended the suspensions, stating that the accounts had violated the platform's policies. Musk claimed that the journalists had engaged in \"doxxing\" – the act of publishing private information about individuals without their consent. However, many of the suspended journalists denied the allegations, stating that they had only shared publicly available information.\n\n#Reinstatement of some accounts\n\nOn December 16, 2022, Twitter reinstated the accounts of several journalists who had been suspended. The reinstatement came after widespread criticism of the suspensions, including from various news organizations and human rights groups. However, some accounts remained suspended, and the incident raised concerns about the consistency and fairness of Twitter's moderation policies.\n\n#Responses\n\n##Suspended journalists\n\nThe journalists who were suspended by Twitter expressed outrage and disappointment at the decision. Many saw the suspensions as an attempt to silence critics of Musk and Twitter, and to conceal information about Musk's private jet movements. The journalists also expressed concern about the impact of the suspensions on press freedom and the ability of journalists to report on important issues.\n\n##Other commentators\n\nOther commentators, including academics, activists, and politicians, also criticized the suspensions. Many saw the incident as a sign of the dangers of unchecked corporate power and the importance of protecting freedom of speech and the press. Others expressed concern about the potential consequences of the suspensions for Twitter's users and for the broader public discourse.\n\n#See also\n\n* Twitter suspensions\n* Elon Musk\n* Twitter moderation policies\n* Press freedom\n* Freedom of speech", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"December_2022_Twitter_suspensions\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Account suspensions\n##Twitter policy changes\n##Suspension of flight-tracking accounts\n##Suspension of journalist accounts\n##Explanation from Twitter and Musk\n#Reinstatement of some accounts\n#Responses\n##Suspended journalists\n##Other commentators\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

His life and career were marked by significant events, including his involvement in the Romanian Orthodox Church's relations with the Soviet Union, his exile in Nazi Germany and Italy, and his subsequent trial for war crimes.\n\n#Early life and monastic career\n\nVisarion Puiu was born on January 16, 1879, in Câmpulung Moldovenesc, a town in the Austro-Hungarian Empire (now in Romania). He came from a family of modest means, with his father working as a merchant and his mother as a homemaker. Puiu's early education took place at the local primary school, where he demonstrated a keen interest in theology and literature.\n\nIn 1895, Puiu entered the Monastery of Neamț, a prominent Orthodox monastery in Moldavia, where he began his monastic career. He studied theology at the monastery's seminary and was tonsured as a monk in 1901. Puiu's ascetic life and devotion to his studies earned him the respect of his superiors, who appointed him as a teacher at the monastery's seminary.\n\n#Metropolitan of Bukovina\n\nIn 1921, Puiu was elected as the Metropolitan of Bukovina, a province in northeastern Romania. As metropolitan, Puiu played a crucial role in promoting the Romanian Orthodox Church's interests in the region. He worked tirelessly to establish new parishes, schools, and social institutions, which helped to strengthen the Church's presence in Bukovina.\n\nDuring his tenure as metropolitan, Puiu also became involved in the Church's relations with the Soviet Union. In 1924, he participated in a delegation of Romanian Orthodox clergy who visited Moscow to negotiate with Soviet authorities about the status of the Orthodox Church in the Soviet Union. Puiu's involvement in these negotiations helped to establish him as a key figure in the Church's relations with the Soviet Union.\n\n#Exarch of Transnistria\n\nIn 1938, Puiu was appointed as the Exarch of Transnistria, a region in eastern Romania that was annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940. As exarch, Puiu was responsible for overseeing the Orthodox Church's activities in the region. However, his tenure was cut short when the Soviet Union annexed Transnistria in 1940.\n\n##Voyage to Croatia and exile in Nazi Germany\n\nFollowing the annexation of Transnistria, Puiu fled to Croatia, where he sought refuge with the Croatian Orthodox Church. However, he soon found himself in danger due to his vocal criticism of the Croatian fascist regime. In 1941, Puiu traveled to Nazi Germany, where he was received by the German Orthodox Church. He spent the remainder of World War II in exile in Germany, where he continued to write and engage in theological debates.\n\n##Exile in Italy and trial for war crimes\n\nIn 1945, Puiu traveled to Italy, where he was arrested by Allied authorities on suspicion of war crimes. Puiu was accused of collaborating with the Nazi regime and of promoting anti-Semitic views. He was put on trial in 1947, but was ultimately acquitted due to lack of evidence.\n\n##Bishop of the Romanian Orthodox Diocese of Western Europe\n\nIn 1950, Puiu was appointed as the Bishop of the Romanian Orthodox Diocese of Western Europe, a position that allowed him to continue his ministry among Romanian Orthodox communities in Western Europe. Puiu played an important role in promoting the interests of the Romanian Orthodox Church in Western Europe, and worked tirelessly to establish new parishes and institutions.\n\n##Final years and death\n\nPuiu spent his final years in exile in Western Europe, where he continued to write and engage in theological debates. He died on August 10, 1964, in Paris, France, at the age of 85.

From the indigenous peoples who first inhabited the island to the Dutch and Spanish colonizers, the Chinese settlers, and the Japanese and American influences, Taiwan's history has been shaped by a diverse array of cultures and empires. This article provides an overview of the major periods in Taiwanese history, from prehistory to the present day.\n\n# Prehistory\n\nThe island of Taiwan has been inhabited by indigenous peoples for thousands of years. Archaeological evidence suggests that the first inhabitants of Taiwan were the Austronesian peoples, who migrated to the island from mainland Asia around 6,000 years ago. These early settlers developed a thriving culture, with their own languages, customs, and traditions. The Austronesian peoples were skilled farmers, hunters, and gatherers, and they lived in small villages and tribes.\n\n# Chinese contact and settlement\n\nThe first recorded contact between Taiwan and China dates back to the 7th century, when Chinese fishermen and traders began to visit the island. However, it was not until the 17th century that Chinese settlement of Taiwan began in earnest. In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a trading post on the island, and Chinese immigrants began to arrive in large numbers. These early Chinese settlers were primarily from the provinces of Fujian and Guangdong, and they brought with them their own languages, customs, and traditions.\n\n# Dutch and Spanish colonies (1624–1668)\n\n## Contact and establishment\n\nIn 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a trading post on the island of Taiwan, which they named Fort Zeelandia. The Dutch were attracted to Taiwan by its strategic location and its natural resources, including sugar, rice, and deerskins. The Dutch trading post was established at Anping, on the southwestern coast of Taiwan, and it quickly became a major center of trade and commerce.\n\n## Piracy\n\nHowever, the Dutch presence in Taiwan was not without its challenges. Pirates and privateers were a major problem, and the Dutch had to contend with frequent attacks on their shipping and their settlements. In 1626, the Dutch established a second trading post at Keelung, on the northeastern coast of Taiwan, in an effort to expand their control over the island.\n\n## Japanese trade\n\nIn the 1630s, the Dutch began to trade with Japan, which had recently been opened to European trade. The Dutch traded with the Japanese for silver, copper, and other valuable commodities, and they used Taiwan as a base for their trade with Japan.\n\n## Spanish Formosa\n\nIn 1626, the Spanish established their own colony on Taiwan, which they named Spanish Formosa. The Spanish colony was established at Keelung, on the northeastern coast of Taiwan, and it was intended to serve as a base for Spanish trade and missionary activity in the region.\n\n## Dutch colonization\n\nIn the 1640s, the Dutch began to expand their control over Taiwan, and they established a number of new settlements and trading posts on the island. The Dutch colonization of Taiwan was accompanied by the forced relocation of indigenous peoples and the introduction of European diseases, which had a devastating impact on the native population.\n\n## Chinese settlers\n\nDuring the Dutch period, Chinese settlers continued to arrive on Taiwan, and they established their own communities and villages. The Chinese settlers were primarily from the provinces of Fujian and Guangdong, and they brought with them their own languages, customs, and traditions.\n\n## End of Dutch rule\n\nIn 1662, the Dutch were driven out of Taiwan by the Chinese pirate-king Koxinga, who established the Kingdom of Tungning on the island. The Dutch period in Taiwan had lasted for 38 years, and it had a lasting impact on the island's history and culture.\n\n# Kingdom of Tungning (1661–1683)\n\n## Conquest\n\nIn 1661, the Chinese pirate-king Koxinga, also known as Zheng Chenggong, conquered Taiwan and drove out the Dutch. Koxinga was a Ming loyalist who had fled to Taiwan after the fall of the Ming dynasty to the Qing in 1644. He established the Kingdom of Tungning on Taiwan, which was intended to serve as a base for his efforts to restore the Ming dynasty.\n\n## Retreat to Taiwan\n\nKoxinga's conquest of Taiwan was motivated by his desire to establish a safe haven for his followers and to launch a campaign to retake the mainland from the Qing. However, his efforts were ultimately unsuccessful, and he was forced to retreat to Taiwan, where he died in 1662.\n\n## Sinicization\n\nDuring the Kingdom of Tungning period, Taiwan underwent a process of sinicization, as Chinese culture and traditions were introduced to the island. The Chinese settlers established their own communities and villages, and they brought with them their own languages, customs, and traditions.\n\n## Shi Lang\n\nIn 1683, the Qing general Shi Lang conquered Taiwan and incorporated it into the Qing empire. Shi Lang was a Ming loyalist who had defected to the Qing and had been tasked with conquering Taiwan. He established a new government on the island, which was intended to serve as a base for Qing rule in the region.\n\n## End of Zheng rule\n\nThe Kingdom of Tungning period came to an end in 1683, when the Qing general Shi Lang conquered Taiwan and incorporated it into the Qing empire. The Zheng family, who had ruled Taiwan since 1662, were forced to flee, and the island was brought under Qing control.\n\n# Qing dynasty (1683–1895)\n\n## Annexation\n\nIn 1683, the Qing dynasty annexed Taiwan, and the island was incorporated into the Qing empire. The Qing government established a new administrative system on the island, which was intended to serve as a base for Qing rule in the region.\n\n## Taiwan administration\n\nDuring the Qing period, Taiwan was administered as a part of the Fujian province. The Qing government established a number of new administrative offices on the island, including the Taiwan Prefecture, which was responsible for governing the island.\n\n## Settler expansion (1684–1795)\n\nDuring the Qing period, Chinese settlement of Taiwan continued to expand, as new immigrants arrived on the island. The Chinese settlers established their own communities and villages, and they brought with them their own languages, customs, and traditions.\n\n## Administrative expansion (1796–1874)\n\nIn the 19th century, the Qing government expanded its administrative control over Taiwan, establishing new offices and institutions on the island. The Qing government also introduced new policies and reforms, intended to modernize and strengthen its rule over the island.\n\n## Expansion in reaction to crises (1875–1895)\n\nIn the late 19th century, the Qing government faced a number of crises, including the Opium Wars and the Taiping Rebellion. In response to these crises, the Qing government expanded its control over Taiwan, establishing new offices and institutions on the island.\n\n## Rebellions\n\nDuring the Qing period, Taiwan experienced a number of rebellions and uprisings, as indigenous peoples and Chinese settlers resisted Qing rule. The most notable rebellion was the Taiping Rebellion, which began in 1850 and lasted for 14 years.\n\n## Invasions\n\nTaiwan was also subject to a number of invasions and attacks during the Qing period, including the French invasion of 1884 and the Japanese invasion of 1895.\n\n## End of Qing rule\n\nThe Qing period in Taiwan came to an end in 1895, when the island was ceded to Japan following the First Sino-Japanese War. The Qing government had ruled Taiwan for 212 years, and its legacy continues to shape the island's history and culture to this day.\n\n# Japanese Empire (1895–1945)\n\n## Armed resistance\n\nFollowing the Japanese occupation of Taiwan, there was a period of armed resistance, as Taiwanese rebels fought against Japanese rule. The most notable rebellion was the Xilai An Incident, which began in 1915 and lasted for several years.\n\n## Non-violent resistance\n\nIn addition to armed resistance, there was also a non-violent resistance movement in Taiwan, as Taiwanese activists and intellectuals sought to promote reform and independence through peaceful means.\n\n## Assimilation movement\n\nDuring the Japanese period, there was a significant assimilation movement, as Taiwanese people were encouraged to adopt Japanese language, customs, and traditions. The Japanese government also introduced a number of policies and reforms, intended to promote assimilation and integration.\n\n## Education\n\nThe Japanese government introduced a new education system in Taiwan, which was intended to promote Japanese language and culture. Taiwanese students were required to study Japanese, and many were sent to Japan for further education.\n\n## Japanization\n\nThe Japanese government also introduced a number of policies and reforms, intended to promote Japanization and assimilation. Taiwanese people were encouraged to adopt Japanese names, and many were forced to abandon their traditional customs and practices.\n\n## Aboriginal policies\n\nThe Japanese government also introduced a number of policies and reforms, intended to address the needs of Taiwan's indigenous peoples. However, these policies were often paternalistic and assimilationist, and they had a negative impact on indigenous communities.\n\n## Japanese colonists\n\nDuring the Japanese period, there was a significant influx of Japanese colonists, who came to Taiwan to work and settle.

These gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, trap heat from the sun, leading to a rise in global temperatures. The effects of climate change are widespread and varied, impacting not only the environment but also human societies and economies.\n\n# Changes in Temperature\n\nOne of the most direct effects of climate change is the increase in global temperatures. The average global temperature has risen by about 1°C since the late 19th century, and the 20 warmest years on record have all occurred since 1981. This warming is not uniform, with some regions experiencing more rapid warming than others. The Arctic, for example, is warming at a rate twice as fast as the global average.\n\n# Weather\n\nClimate change is also altering weather patterns around the world. This includes changes in precipitation, temperature extremes, and weather events such as heatwaves, droughts, and storms.\n\n## Heat Waves and Temperature Extremes\n\nHeatwaves are becoming more frequent and prolonged, with some regions experiencing temperatures that are 3-4°C higher than the average high temperature. This can have severe impacts on human health, particularly for vulnerable populations such as the elderly and young children. Temperature extremes are also becoming more common, with some areas experiencing temperatures that are 5-6°C higher than the average high temperature.\n\n## Rain\n\nChanges in precipitation patterns are also occurring, with some regions experiencing more frequent and intense rainfall events. This can lead to flooding, landslides, and other hazards. In contrast, other regions are experiencing more frequent and prolonged droughts, which can have severe impacts on agriculture and water resources.\n\n## Extreme Storms\n\nClimate change is also leading to more frequent and intense extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, typhoons, and cyclones. These storms can cause catastrophic damage to infrastructure, homes, and the environment, and can also lead to loss of life.\n\n# Land\n\nClimate change is having significant impacts on land, including changes in sea levels, more frequent natural disasters, and altered ecosystems.\n\n## Floods\n\nRising sea levels and more frequent extreme weather events are leading to more frequent and severe flooding. This can have devastating impacts on communities, particularly in low-lying coastal areas.\n\n## Droughts\n\nDroughts are becoming more frequent and prolonged, with some regions experiencing severe water shortages. This can have significant impacts on agriculture, industry, and human consumption.\n\n## Wildfires\n\nClimate change is also leading to more frequent and severe wildfires, particularly in regions with rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns. These fires can have devastating impacts on ecosystems, human health, and the economy.\n\n# Oceans\n\nClimate change is having significant impacts on the world's oceans, including rising sea levels, ocean acidification, and changes in marine ecosystems.\n\n## Sea Level Rise\n\nRising sea levels are one of the most significant impacts of climate change, with the global sea level rising by about 15-20 cm since 1900. This can lead to more frequent and severe coastal erosion, flooding, and saltwater intrusion into freshwater sources.\n\n# Ice and Snow\n\nClimate change is also having significant impacts on ice and snow, including the decline of glaciers, ice sheets, and sea ice.\n\n## Glaciers Decline\n\nGlaciers around the world are retreating at an unprecedented rate, with some glaciers losing up to 90% of their mass in recent decades. This can have significant impacts on sea levels, water resources, and ecosystems.\n\n## Ice Sheets Decline\n\nThe world's two largest ice sheets, in Greenland and Antarctica, are also declining at an unprecedented rate. This can have significant impacts on sea levels, with some estimates suggesting that the Greenland ice sheet alone could raise sea levels by up to 7 meters.\n\n## Sea Ice Decline\n\nThe extent and thickness of sea ice in the Arctic are declining at an unprecedented rate, with some estimates suggesting that the Arctic could be ice-free in the summer by the 2040s. This can have significant impacts on ecosystems, including the loss of habitat for polar bears and other species.\n\n## Permafrost Thawing\n\nPermafrost, or frozen ground, is thawing at an unprecedented rate, with some estimates suggesting that up to 70% of the world's permafrost could thaw by 2100. This can have significant impacts on ecosystems, including the release of methane and other greenhouse gases.\n\n# Wildlife and Nature\n\nClimate change is having significant impacts on wildlife and ecosystems around the world.\n\n## Ecosystems on Land\n\nClimate change is altering ecosystems on land, including changes in species composition, migration patterns, and extinction risk. Some ecosystems, such as coral reefs and polar ecosystems, are particularly vulnerable to climate change.\n\n## Marine Ecosystems\n\nClimate change is also altering marine ecosystems, including changes in ocean temperature, acidification, and circulation patterns. Some marine ecosystems, such as coral reefs and kelp forests, are particularly vulnerable to climate change.\n\n# Tipping Points and Irreversible Impacts\n\nClimate change is also leading to tipping points and irreversible impacts, including the loss of ecosystems, species extinctions, and changes in ocean circulation patterns.\n\n# Health, Food Security and Water Security\n\nClimate change is having significant impacts on human health, food security, and water security.\n\n## Health\n\nClimate change is increasing the spread of disease, heat stress, and other health problems. Some populations, such as the elderly and young children, are particularly vulnerable to these impacts.\n\n## Food Security\n\nClimate change is altering agricultural productivity, with some regions experiencing more frequent and severe crop failures. This can have significant impacts on food security, particularly in vulnerable populations.\n\n## Water Security\n\nClimate change is also altering water resources, with some regions experiencing more frequent and severe droughts and floods. This can have significant impacts on human consumption, agriculture, and industry.\n\n# Human Settlements\n\nClimate change is also having significant impacts on human settlements, including more frequent and severe natural disasters, and changes in sea levels.\n\n## Impacts from Heat\n\nClimate change is increasing the frequency and severity of heatwaves, which can have significant impacts on human health and mortality.\n\n## Low-Lying Coastal Regions\n\nRising sea levels and more frequent extreme weather events are leading to more frequent and severe flooding in low-lying coastal regions.\n\n# Impacts on Societies\n\nClimate change is having significant impacts on societies around the world, including displacement and migration, conflict, and social impacts on vulnerable groups.\n\n## Displacement and Migration\n\nClimate change is leading to more frequent and severe displacement and migration, particularly in vulnerable populations. This can have significant impacts on social cohesion, economic development, and human rights.\n\n## Conflict\n\nClimate change is also leading to more frequent and severe conflict, particularly over resources such as water and land. This can have significant impacts on human security, economic development, and social cohesion.\n\n## Social Impacts on Vulnerable Groups\n\nClimate change is having significant social impacts on vulnerable groups, including the poor, women, and indigenous populations. These impacts can include loss of livelihoods, increased poverty, and reduced access to education and healthcare.\n\n## Possibility of Societal Collapse\n\nClimate change is also raising the possibility of societal collapse, particularly in vulnerable regions. This can have significant impacts on human security, economic development, and social cohesion.\n\n# Economic Impacts\n\nClimate change is having significant economic impacts around the world, including changes in productivity, consumption, and investment.\n\n## Economic Inequality\n\nClimate change is increasing economic inequality, particularly in vulnerable populations. This can have significant impacts on social cohesion, economic development, and human rights.\n\n## Highly Affected Sectors\n\nSome sectors, such as agriculture, forestry, and tourism, are particularly vulnerable to climate change. This can have significant impacts on productivity, consumption, and investment.\n\n# See also\n\n* Climate change\n* Global warming\n* Greenhouse gas\n* Carbon dioxide\n* Methane\n* Deforestation\n* Ocean acidification\n* Sea level rise\n* Ice sheet\n* Glacier\n* Permafrost\n* Ecosystem\n* Biodiversity\n* Wildlife\n* Conservation\n* Sustainability\n* Renewable energy\n* Energy transition\n\n# References\n\n* Sources:\n\t+ IPCC (2013).

From its humble beginnings as a Jewish sect in the 1st century to its current status as a global faith, Christianity has undergone numerous transformations, developments, and challenges. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the history of Christianity, from its early beginnings to the present day.\n\n#Early Christianity\n\n##Jewish background\n\nChristianity emerged from Judaism in the 1st century CE. The Jewish people had a long history of worshiping one God, Yahweh, and following the laws and traditions outlined in the Hebrew Bible. The Jewish community in Palestine was diverse, with various sects and groups, including the Pharisees, Sadducees, and Essenes. Jesus of Nazareth, a Jewish preacher and teacher, was born into this context and would eventually become the central figure of Christianity.\n\n##Apostolic Age (c. 30–100)\n\n###Developing church structure\n\nAfter Jesus' death and resurrection, his followers, known as the apostles, began to spread his teachings and establish communities of believers. The apostles, led by Peter and James, formed the Jerusalem church, which became the center of the early Christian movement. As the church grew, it developed a structure, with bishops, presbyters, and deacons serving as leaders.\n\n###Early growth\n\nThe early Christian church experienced rapid growth, with converts from various backgrounds, including Jews, Gentiles (non-Jews), and slaves. The apostles preached about Jesus' life, death, and resurrection, and performed miracles, which helped to attract followers. The church also developed a system of charity, caring for the poor and the sick.\n\n##Ante-Nicene period (100–312)\n\n###Scripture\n\nDuring this period, the early Christian church began to develop its scripture. The apostles wrote letters, known as epistles, to various churches, which were later collected into the New Testament. The Old Testament, which was already established, was also adopted as part of the Christian scripture. The process of canonization, or determining which texts were authoritative, took several centuries.\n\n###Early Christian art\n\nEarly Christian art emerged during this period, with symbols, such as the cross, the fish, and the Chi-Rho (a combination of the Greek letters X and P), becoming common. Art was used to convey Christian themes and messages, and to decorate churches and other buildings.\n\n###Persecutions and legalization\n\nThe early Christian church faced numerous persecutions, particularly under the Roman Empire. Christians were seen as a threat to the empire's authority and were often punished, imprisoned, or executed. However, in 313 CE, the Edict of Milan, issued by Emperor Constantine, granted Christians freedom of worship, marking a significant turning point in the history of Christianity.\n\n##Spread of Christianity to c. 300 AD\n\n###Inclusivity, women and exclusivity\n\nEarly Christianity was inclusive, with women playing a significant role in the church. Women, such as Mary Magdalene and Phoebe, were among the earliest followers of Jesus and were recognized as leaders in the church. However, as the church grew, it became more exclusive, with women's roles becoming limited.\n\n###Moral practices\n\nEarly Christians developed a distinct moral code, based on Jesus' teachings. They emphasized the importance of love, compassion, and forgiveness, and practiced charity, caring for the poor and the sick.\n\n#Late antiquity (313–476)\n\n##Conversion of Constantine\n\n###Christianity and the state\n\nIn 312 CE, Emperor Constantine converted to Christianity, marking a significant turning point in the history of the faith. Constantine's conversion led to the establishment of Christianity as the official state religion of the Roman Empire.\n\n###Christianity and polytheism\n\nAs Christianity spread, it encountered various forms of polytheism, or the worship of multiple gods. Christians saw themselves as monotheists, worshiping one God, and often clashed with polytheistic cultures.\n\n##Augustine's ethic toward Jews\n\nSt. Augustine, a prominent Christian theologian, developed a complex ethic toward Jews. While Augustine believed that Jews were responsible for Jesus' death, he also argued that they should be tolerated and protected.\n\n##Developing orthodoxy and heresy\n\nAs Christianity spread, various forms of orthodoxy (correct belief) and heresy (incorrect belief) emerged. The early Christian church developed creeds, such as the Nicene Creed, to define its beliefs and distinguish itself from heretical groups.\n\n##Church of the East\n\nThe Church of the East, also known as the Nestorian Church, emerged in the 5th century CE. This church, which flourished in Mesopotamia and Central Asia, developed a distinct theology and liturgy.\n\n##Hospitals\n\nEarly Christian hospitals, such as the one founded by St. Basil in Caesarea, provided care for the sick and the poor. These hospitals became centers of Christian charity and compassion.\n\n##Art and literature\n\nChristian art and literature flourished during this period, with the development of illuminated manuscripts, mosaics, and other forms of art. Christian writers, such as St. Augustine and St. Jerome, produced influential works of literature.\n\n##Spread and growth of Christianity\n\n###Christianity in the Roman Africa province\n\nChristianity spread rapidly in the Roman province of Africa, where it became a major force in the 4th and 5th centuries CE.\n\n###German Europe, Britain and Ireland\n\nChristianity spread to German Europe, Britain, and Ireland through the efforts of missionaries, such as St. Patrick and St. Columba.\n\n###Asia\n\nChristianity spread to Asia, particularly to India and China, through the Silk Road and other trade routes.\n\n#Early Middle Ages (476–842)\n\n##Justinian I\n\nJustinian I, who ruled the Byzantine Empire from 527 to 565 CE, attempted to reunify the Roman Empire and promote Christianity.

Monasteries and convents provided a haven for spiritual seekers and promoted Christian values.\n\n##Art\n\nEarly medieval art, such as the Lindisfarne Gospels and the Book of Kells, showcased intricate designs and illuminated manuscripts.\n\n##Papal supremacy\n\nThe papacy, or the office of the bishop of Rome, became increasingly powerful, with popes such as Gregory I and Boniface VIII asserting their authority over the church.\n\n##Spread and growth of Christianity\n\nChristianity continued to spread, particularly through the efforts of missionaries, such as St. Boniface and St. Willibrord.\n\n#High Middle Ages (842–1299)\n\n##Christendom 842-1099\n\n###Tenth and eleventh century reform\n\nThe 10th and 11th centuries saw a wave of reform, with the emergence of the Cluniac movement, which emphasized monastic reform and the promotion of Christian values.\n\n###Investiture controversy (1078)\n\nThe investiture controversy, which pitted the papacy against the Holy Roman Empire, marked a significant turning point in the history of Christianity.\n\n###Toledo 1085\n\nThe capture of Toledo in 1085 CE marked a significant turning point in the Reconquista, or the Christian reconquest of Spain.\n\n###First crusade (1095)\n\nThe First Crusade, launched in 1095 CE, marked the beginning of the Crusades, a series of military campaigns aimed at recapturing the Holy Land from Muslim rule.\n\n###Learning and change\n\nThe High Middle Ages saw a resurgence of learning, with the emergence of universities, such as the University of Paris and the University of Oxford.\n\n###Scholasticism, Renaissance and science (1150-1200)\n\nScholasticism, which emphasized the use of reason and dialectic, emerged as a dominant intellectual movement. The Renaissance, which emphasized humanism and classical learning, also began to take shape.\n\n###Universities\n\nUniversities, such as the University of Bologna and the University of Cambridge, became centers of learning and intellectual inquiry.\n\n##Political power, the church and the papacy\n\n###Papacy\n\nThe papacy continued to assert its authority, with popes such as Alexander III and Innocent III playing significant roles in shaping Christian policy.\n\n###Medieval Inquisition\n\nThe Medieval Inquisition, which emerged in the 12th century CE, aimed to root out heresy and promote orthodoxy.\n\n###Fourth crusade (1204)\n\nThe Fourth Crusade, which resulted in the sack of Constantinople, marked a significant turning point in the history of Christianity.\n\n##Spread and retraction of Christianity from the 800s\n\n###Mesopotamia and Egypt\n\nChristianity declined in Mesopotamia and Egypt, particularly with the rise of Islam.\n\n###Scandinavia\n\nChristianity spread to Scandinavia, particularly through the efforts of missionaries, such as St. Ansgar and St. Olaf.\n\n###Russia\n\nChristianity spread to Russia, particularly through the efforts of missionaries, such as St. Cyril and St. Methodius.\n\n###Baltic and central Europe\n\nChristianity spread to the Baltic region and central Europe, particularly through the efforts of missionaries, such as St. Bruno of Querfurt.\n\n###The East (1054)\n\nThe Great Schism of 1054 CE marked a significant turning point in the history of Christianity, with the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church splitting apart.\n\n###Northern crusades (1147–1316)\n\nThe Northern Crusades, which aimed to convert the pagan populations of Northern Europe, marked a significant turning point in the history of Christianity.\n\n###Albigensian Crusade (1209 - 1229)\n\nThe Albigensian Crusade, which aimed to root out the Cathar heresy, marked a significant turning point in the history of Christianity.\n\n##Persecution of Jews\n\n###Fourth Lateran Council (1215)\n\nThe Fourth Lateran Council, which marked a significant turning point in the history of Christian-Jewish relations, led to increased persecution of Jews.\n\n#Late Middle Ages and early Renaissance (c. 1300–1520)\n\n##Avignon Papacy and the Western Schism\n\nThe Avignon Papacy, which saw the papacy relocate to Avignon, France, led to the Western Schism, a period of division within the church.\n\n##Criticism and reform\n\nCritics, such as John Wycliffe and Jan Hus, emerged, calling for reform and challenging the authority of the church.\n\n##Art\n\nLate medieval art, such as the works of Giotto and Fra Angelico, showcased a new style, emphasizing realism and humanism.\n\n##Byzantium and the Fall of Constantinople in 1453\n\nThe Fall of Constantinople in 1453 CE marked a significant turning point in the history of Christianity, with the Eastern Orthodox Church losing its center of power.\n\n##Modern Inquisition\n\nThe Modern Inquisition, which emerged in the 15th century CE, aimed to root out heresy and promote orthodoxy.\n\n##Expulsion of Jews\n\nThe Expulsion of Jews from

With a career spanning over two decades, Abu Akleh was known for her fearless reporting on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, earning her widespread recognition and respect in the Middle East and beyond.\n\n#Early life and education\n\nShireen Abu Akleh was born on April 3, 1971, in Jerusalem, to a Palestinian Christian family. She grew up in the Beit Hanina neighborhood of East Jerusalem and developed an interest in journalism from an early age. Abu Akleh pursued her passion for journalism at Yarmouk University in Jordan, where she earned a bachelor's degree in English literature. After completing her studies, she moved to the United States, where she worked as a journalist and later relocated to the Middle East to cover the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\n#Career\n\nAbu Akleh began her journalism career in the late 1990s, working for various media outlets, including Voice of Palestine and Radio Monte Carlo. In 2000, she joined Al Jazeera, where she quickly gained recognition for her in-depth reporting on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Over the years, Abu Akleh covered numerous significant events, including the Second Intifada, the Gaza War, and the Israeli disengagement from Gaza. Her fearless and balanced reporting earned her widespread respect, and she became one of the most prominent Palestinian journalists in the Arab world.\n\nThroughout her career, Abu Akleh received numerous awards and honors for her journalism. She was known for her ability to tell the stories of ordinary Palestinians, highlighting the human cost of the conflict. Her reporting often put her in harm's way, but she remained committed to telling the stories that needed to be told.\n\n#Death\n\nOn May 11, 2022, Shireen Abu Akleh was shot and killed while reporting on an Israeli military raid in the West Bank city of Jenin. Abu Akleh was wearing a press vest and helmet at the time of her death, clearly identifying herself as a journalist. The incident sparked widespread outrage and condemnation, with many calling for an independent investigation into the circumstances surrounding her death.\n\n##Aftermath\n\nThe aftermath of Abu Akleh's death saw a massive outpouring of grief and anger across the Middle East and beyond. Al Jazeera and other media outlets condemned the killing, calling it a \"heinous crime\" and a \"deliberate attack\" on press freedom. The Palestinian Authority and other Palestinian factions also condemned the killing, with many accusing Israel of deliberately targeting Abu Akleh.\n\nThe Israeli military initially claimed that Abu Akleh was killed in a crossfire between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants. However, eyewitnesses and video footage disputed this account, suggesting that Abu Akleh was shot by Israeli forces. The incident sparked a significant escalation in tensions between Israel and the Palestinians, with many fearing a wider outbreak of violence.\n\n#Funeral\n\nOn May 13, 2022, Shireen Abu Akleh was laid to rest in Jerusalem's Mount Zion Cemetery. The funeral was attended by thousands of mourners, including Palestinian officials, journalists, and ordinary citizens. The funeral procession was marked by clashes between Israeli police and Palestinian mourners, with many accusing the Israeli authorities of attempting to suppress the event.\n\nAbu Akleh's funeral was seen as a symbol of Palestinian resistance and resilience, with many using the occasion to call for justice and accountability for her killing. The funeral was also attended by representatives of Al Jazeera and other media outlets, who paid tribute to Abu Akleh's bravery and dedication to journalism.\n\n#Reaction\n\nThe killing of Shireen Abu Akleh sparked widespread condemnation and outrage across the world. Many governments, including the United States, the European Union, and the United Kingdom, called for an independent investigation into the circumstances surrounding her death. The United Nations also condemned the killing, calling it a \"serious violation\" of international law.\n\nThe international community also paid tribute to Abu Akleh's bravery and dedication to journalism. Many journalists and media outlets around the world honored her memory, highlighting the risks and challenges faced by journalists reporting on conflict zones.\n\n#Investigations\n\nThe killing of Shireen Abu Akleh sparked several investigations into the circumstances surrounding her death.\n\n##Initial Israel investigations\n\nThe Israeli military initially claimed that Abu Akleh was killed in a crossfire between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants. However, this account was disputed by eyewitnesses and video footage, which suggested that Abu Akleh was shot by Israeli forces. The Israeli military later announced that it would conduct an investigation into the incident, but many questioned the impartiality of the investigation.\n\n##Subsequent investigations\n\nIn the aftermath of Abu Akleh's death, several independent investigations were launched into the circumstances surrounding her killing. These investigations included a probe by the Palestinian Authority, as well as an investigation by the Al Jazeera network. These investigations found that Abu Akleh was deliberately targeted by Israeli forces, and that her killing was a \"war crime\" under international law.\n\n##Announcement of US investigation\n\nIn May 2022, the United States announced that it would conduct its own investigation into the killing of Shireen Abu Akleh. The investigation was seen as a significant development, as it marked the first time that the US had launched a probe into the killing of a journalist in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\n##Referral of case to the International Criminal Court\n\nIn June 2022, the case of Shireen Abu Akleh was referred to the International Criminal Court (ICC) by the Palestinian Authority. The referral was seen as a significant development, as it marked the first time that the ICC had been asked to investigate the killing of a journalist in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The ICC later announced that it would launch a formal investigation into the killing, which was seen as a major step towards holding those responsible accountable.\n\n#Remembrance and legacy\n\nShireen Abu Akleh's legacy continues to be felt across the Middle East and beyond. Her bravery and dedication to journalism have inspired a new generation of journalists and activists, who continue to tell the stories of ordinary Palestinians and highlight the human cost of the conflict.\n\nAbu Akleh's memory has also been honored through various tributes and memorials.

The clashes resulted in significant loss of life, infrastructure damage, and a deterioration of relations between the two countries.\n\n#Background\n\nThe Armenia–Azerbaijan conflict has its roots in the early 20th century, when both countries were part of the Soviet Union. The dispute over the Nagorno-Karabakh region, which is internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan but has a majority ethnic Armenian population, has been a major point of contention between the two countries. The conflict escalated into a full-scale war in the early 1990s, resulting in significant human suffering and displacement.\n\nIn recent years, tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan have remained high, with periodic outbreaks of violence along the border. The 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war resulted in significant territorial changes, with Azerbaijan regaining control of several areas that had been under Armenian control. However, the conflict remains unresolved, and tensions between the two countries remain high.\n\n#Timeline\n\n##12–13 September\n\nOn September 12, 2022, clashes broke out between Armenian and Azerbaijani forces along the border. The clashes reportedly began when Azerbaijani forces attempted to advance on Armenian positions in the Gegharkunik Province. Armenian forces responded with artillery fire, and the clashes quickly escalated into a full-scale confrontation.\n\nOver the next 24 hours, the clashes continued, with both sides reporting significant casualties. The Armenian Ministry of Defense reported that at least 49 Armenian soldiers had been killed, while the Azerbaijani Ministry of Defense reported that at least 71 Azerbaijani soldiers had been killed.\n\n##14–16 September\n\nOn September 14, 2022, the clashes continued, with both sides reporting further casualties. The Armenian Ministry of Defense reported that at least 20 Armenian soldiers had been killed, while the Azerbaijani Ministry of Defense reported that at least 30 Azerbaijani soldiers had been killed.\n\nOn September 15, 2022, the Azerbaijani Ministry of Defense reported that it had launched a counterattack against Armenian forces in the Vardenis region. The counterattack reportedly resulted in significant casualties for the Armenian side.\n\nOn September 16, 2022, the clashes began to subside, with both sides reporting a decrease in violence. However, tensions between the two countries remained high, and the conflict remained unresolved.\n\n##21–29 September\n\nOn September 21, 2022, the clashes resumed, with both sides reporting further casualties. The Armenian Ministry of Defense reported that at least 10 Armenian soldiers had been killed, while the Azerbaijani Ministry of Defense reported that at least 20 Azerbaijani soldiers had been killed.\n\nOver the next week, the clashes continued, with both sides reporting significant casualties. The Armenian Ministry of Defense reported that at least 100 Armenian soldiers had been killed, while the Azerbaijani Ministry of Defense reported that at least 150 Azerbaijani soldiers had been killed.\n\nOn September 29, 2022, the clashes finally subsided, with both sides reporting a decrease in violence. However, tensions between the two countries remained high, and the conflict remained unresolved.\n\n#Shelling of Russian military\n\nOn September 14, 2022, the Russian Ministry of Defense reported that Russian peacekeeping forces in Nagorno-Karabakh had come under fire from Azerbaijani forces. The shelling reportedly resulted in significant damage to Russian equipment and infrastructure.\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense condemned the shelling, stating that it was a \"gross violation\" of international law.

From the early days of the Russian Empire to the modern era, Russian cinema has produced some of the most influential and iconic films in the world. This article will explore the history of Russian cinema, from its early beginnings to the present day, including its development during the Soviet era, the emergence of new Russian cinema, and the current state of the industry.\n\n# Cinema of the Russian Empire\n\nThe cinema of the Russian Empire began in the late 19th century, with the first film screenings taking place in 1896. The early days of Russian cinema were marked by a fascination with the new technology, and films were often shown as part of vaudeville shows or as a novelty attraction. As the industry developed, Russian filmmakers began to produce their own films, often using literary classics as source material.\n\nOne of the most influential filmmakers of this period was Alexander Khanzhonkov, who is considered to be the founder of Russian cinema. Khanzhonkov's films, such as \"The Defense of Sevastopol\" (1911), were known for their high production values and their use of location shooting. Another notable filmmaker of this period was Yakov Protasanov, who directed films such as \"The Queen of Spades\" (1916).\n\n# Cinema of the Soviet Union\n\nThe cinema of the Soviet Union was born in the aftermath of the Russian Revolution, and it quickly became a powerful tool for propaganda and social commentary. The Soviet government saw cinema as a way to reach a wide audience and to promote its ideology, and it invested heavily in the film industry.\n\n## Early Soviet cinema (1917–1953)\n\nThe early years of Soviet cinema were marked by a series of experiments with form and content. Filmmakers such as Sergei Eisenstein and Dziga Vertov pushed the boundaries of what was possible on screen, using montage and other techniques to create a new kind of cinema.\n\nEisenstein's \"Battleship Potemkin\" (1925) is considered one of the greatest films of all time, and it is still studied by film students around the world. Vertov's \"Man with a Movie Camera\" (1929) is another influential film of this period, and it is known for its use of montage and its exploration of the relationship between the camera and reality.\n\n## Late Soviet cinema (1953–1990)\n\nThe late Soviet period saw a decline in the experimental spirit of early Soviet cinema, and films became more conventional and more focused on storytelling. However, this period also saw the emergence of some of the greatest filmmakers of the Soviet era, including Andrei Tarkovsky and Nikita Mikhalkov.\n\nTarkovsky's films, such as \"Andrei Rublev\" (1966) and \"Solaris\" (1972), are known for their philosophical and poetic themes, as well as their use of long takes and other unconventional techniques. Mikhalkov's films, such as \"Five Evenings\" (1978) and \"Oblomov\" (1980), are known for their nuanced portrayals of Soviet life and their use of satire and social commentary.\n\n# New Russian cinema\n\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union saw a decline in the Russian film industry, but it also created new opportunities for filmmakers. The emergence of new Russian cinema in the 1990s saw a new generation of filmmakers exploring new themes and new styles.\n\n## 1990s\n\nThe 1990s saw the emergence of filmmakers such as Pavel Lungin and Alexander Sokurov. Lungin's films, such as \"Taxi Blues\" (1990) and \"Luna Park\" (1992), are known for their gritty portrayals of Russian life and their use of social commentary. Sokurov's films, such as \"Days of the Eclipse\" (1988) and \"Whispers of the Empire\" (1993), are known for their poetic and philosophical themes, as well as their use of unconventional techniques.\n\n## 2000s\n\nThe 2000s saw the emergence of filmmakers such as Timur Bekmambetov and Alexey Balabanov. Bekmambetov's films, such as \"Night Watch\" (2004) and \"Day Watch\" (2006), are known for their use of action and fantasy elements, as well as their exploration of Russian mythology. Balabanov's films, such as \"Brat\" (1997) and \"Of Freaks and Men\" (1998), are known for their dark and subversive portrayals of Russian life.\n\n## 2010s\n\nThe 2010s saw the emergence of filmmakers such as Andrey Zvyagintsev and Kirill Serebrennikov. Zvyagintsev's films, such as \"Leviathan\" (2014) and \"Loveless\" (2017), are known for their nuanced portrayals of Russian life and their use of social commentary. Serebrennikov's films, such as \"The Student\" (2016) and \"Summer\" (2018), are known for their use of satire and their exploration of Russian youth culture.\n\n## 2020s\n\nThe 2020s have seen a new generation of Russian filmmakers emerge, including Kantemir Balagov and Ivan Tverdovsky. Balagov's films, such as \"Closeness\" (2017) and \"Beanpole\" (2019), are known for their poetic and philosophical themes, as well as their use of unconventional techniques. Tverdovsky's films, such as \"Zoology\" (2016) and \"Jumpman\" (2018), are known for their use of satire and their exploration of Russian middle-class life.\n\n### 2022 boycott\n\nIn 2022, a number of Russian filmmakers, including Zvyagintsev and Serebrennikov, publicly boycotted the Russian film industry in response to the country's invasion of Ukraine. The boycott was seen as a significant blow to the Russian film industry, and it highlighted the ongoing challenges faced by Russian filmmakers in the current political climate.\n\n# Russian film production\n\nThe Russian film industry has undergone significant changes in recent years, with the emergence of new production companies and the growth of international co-productions.\n\n## Leading production companies on the market\n\nSome of the leading production companies in the Russian film industry include:\n\n* Lenfilm\n* Mosfilm\n* Central Partnership\n* STV\n* Amedia\n\n## List of highest-grossing films\n\nSome of the highest-grossing films in Russian cinema history include:\n\n* \"Stalingrad\" (2013)\n* \"Panfilov's 28 Men\" (2016)\n* \"The Battle for Moscow\" (2016)\n* \"The Dawns Here Are Quiet\" (2015)\n* \"Leviathan\" (2014)\n\n## Film distribution\n\nThe Russian film industry has a complex distribution system, with a number of different companies and platforms involved in the distribution of films.\n\n# Awards\n\nThe Russian film industry has a number of awards and festivals, including:\n\n* The Golden Eagle Awards\n* The Nika Awards\n* The Kinotavr Film Festival\n* The Moscow International Film Festival\n\n# Festivals\n\nSome of the most important film festivals in Russia include:\n\n* The Moscow International Film Festival\n* The Kinotavr Film Festival\n* The St. Petersburg International Film Festival\n* The Vladivostok International Film Festival\n\n# VOD platforms\n\nThe Russian film industry has a number of VOD platforms, including:\n\n* Okko\n* ivi\n* Megogo\n* Amediateka\n\n# Cinematography schools\n\nThe Russian film industry has a number of cinematography schools, including:\n\n* The Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography\n* The Moscow Film School\n* The St. Petersburg State University of Film and Television\n\n# See also\n\n* List of Russian films\n* List of Soviet films\n* Russian animation\n\n# References\n\n# Further reading\n\n* Taylor, Richard. \"The Film Factory: Russian and Soviet Cinema in Documents\".

It is a global day to recognize the social, economic, cultural, and political achievements of women. The day also marks a call to action for accelerating women's equality and is often marked with events and rallies around the world.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\n### Origins\n\nThe origins of International Women's Day date back to the early 20th century. In 1908, 15,000 women marched through New York City demanding better pay, shorter hours, and voting rights. In 1910, the International Conference of Socialist Women was held in Copenhagen, Denmark, where Clara Zetkin, a German socialist, proposed the idea of an International Women's Day.\n\n### The Russian Revolution and Communist countries\n\nIn 1917, following the Russian Revolution, the first International Women's Day was celebrated in Russia on the last Sunday in February. After the revolution, the day was celebrated annually in Russia and other communist countries. In 1921, the Communist International (Comintern) officially declared March 8 as International Women's Day.\n\n### Other countries, 1920s to 1960s\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, International Women's Day was celebrated in several countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. However, the day gained little attention in the West until the 1960s, when the feminist movement began to gain momentum.\n\n### Second–wave feminism\n\nThe second-wave feminist movement of the 1960s and 1970s helped to revive interest in International Women's Day. In 1975, the United Nations (UN) declared 1975 as International Women's Year, and March 8 was officially recognized as International Women's Day.\n\n### Adoption by United Nations\n\nIn 1977, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution proclaiming March 8 as the UN Day for Women's Rights and International Peace. Since then, the UN has played a significant role in promoting International Women's Day.\n\n### Adoption by corporations\n\nIn recent years, International Women's Day has gained significant attention from corporations and brands.

In Massachusetts, this period saw the construction of many houses that still stand today, showcasing the architectural styles and techniques of the time. This article will explore the First Period houses in Massachusetts, specifically those built between 1660 and 1679.\n\n#Legend\n\nBefore delving into the specifics of First Period houses in Massachusetts, it is essential to understand the terminology used to describe these structures. The \"First Period\" refers to the earliest phase of American architecture, roughly spanning from 1600 to 1700. Within this period, several sub-styles emerged, including the Post-Medieval English, Early Colonial, and Medieval styles. These styles were characterized by the use of local materials, such as wood and stone, and the influence of English and European architectural traditions.\n\n#1660–1670\n\nDuring the 1660s, Massachusetts saw a significant increase in population and economic growth, leading to an expansion of building activity. Many of the houses constructed during this period were built using traditional English methods, with modifications to suit the local climate and available materials.\n\n##Post-Medieval English Style\n\nThe Post-Medieval English style was a dominant force in Massachusetts architecture during the 1660s. Characterized by the use of wood framing, steeply pitched roofs, and central chimneys, this style was well-suited to the local climate. Many examples of Post-Medieval English houses from this period still stand in Massachusetts, including the Fairbanks House (1636) in Dedham and the Parson Capen House (1683) in Topsfield.\n\n##Early Colonial Style\n\nThe Early Colonial style emerged in the 1660s as a distinct variation of the Post-Medieval English style. Characterized by the use of clapboard siding, central chimneys, and a more symmetrical facade, this style was popularized by wealthier colonists. The John Whipple House (1650) in Ipswich is an excellent example of an Early Colonial-style house from this period.\n\n##Medieval Style\n\nThe Medieval style, also known as the \"saltbox\" style, was a popular choice for Massachusetts colonists during the 1660s. Characterized by a long, sloping roofline and a central chimney, this style was well-suited to the local climate and available materials. The Thomas Lee House (1660) in East Lyme, Connecticut, is an excellent example of a Medieval-style house from this period.\n\n#1671–1679\n\nThe late 1670s saw a continuation of the architectural trends established in the 1660s, with a growing emphasis on ornamentation and decorative details. Many of the houses constructed during this period featured elaborate door surrounds, carved woodwork, and other decorative elements.\n\n##Ornate Door Surrounds\n\nOne of the defining features of Massachusetts houses from the late 1670s is the ornate door surround. Characterized by intricate carvings, moldings, and other decorative elements, these door surrounds added a touch of elegance to the facade of the house. The Samuel Fowler House (1674) in Danvers is an excellent example of a house from this period featuring an ornate door surround.\n\n##Carved Woodwork\n\nThe late 1670s also saw a growing emphasis on carved woodwork in Massachusetts houses. Characterized by intricate carvings, moldings, and other decorative elements, this type of woodwork added a touch of elegance to the interior of the house. The Gedney House (1665) in Salem is an excellent example of a house from this period featuring carved woodwork.\n\n##Other Decorative Elements\n\nIn addition to ornate door surrounds and carved woodwork, many Massachusetts houses from the late 1670s featured other decorative elements, such as wainscoting, paneling, and ornate chimneypieces. The John Howland House (1667) in Plymouth is an excellent example of a house from this period featuring a range of decorative elements.\n\n#See also\n\n* First Period architecture\n* Colonial Revival architecture\n* Post-Medieval English architecture\n* Early Colonial architecture\n* Medieval architecture\n* Saltbox architecture\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is a general overview of First Period houses in Massachusetts, specifically those built between 1660 and 1679.
