Born on June 10, 1964, Harding was known for his passion for adventure, innovative spirit, and commitment to pushing the boundaries of human achievement.\n\nEarly Life and Education\n------------------------\n\nHamish Harding was born in the United Kingdom and spent his early years in various parts of the world, including Africa and Asia, where his family worked as missionaries. This exposure to diverse cultures and environments instilled in him a sense of curiosity and adventure that would define his later life. Harding received his primary education in the United Kingdom and later attended the University of Edinburgh, where he studied economics and politics.\n\nCareer and Adventures\n----------------------\n\nAfter completing his education, Harding began his career in finance, working for several prominent investment banks in London. However, his passion for adventure and exploration soon led him to pursue a career in aviation. Harding obtained his private pilot's license and began flying extensively throughout Europe and beyond. In the late 1990s, he founded his own aviation company, Action Aviation, which specialized in charter flights, aircraft management, and flight training.\n\nHarding's love of adventure and exploration led him to participate in numerous record-breaking flights and expeditions. In 2003, he became the first person to fly a single-engine aircraft around the world in a westbound direction. This achievement earned him a place in the Guinness World Records and marked the beginning of his reputation as a pioneering aviator.\n\nTitan Expedition and Death\n---------------------------\n\nIn 2012, Harding embarked on his most ambitious expedition to date: a journey to the bottom of the ocean in a deep-sea submersible. The expedition, known as the \"Titan Expedition,\" aimed to reach the wreck of the RMS Titanic, which lies at a depth of over 12,000 feet in the North Atlantic Ocean. Harding was part of a team of explorers, scientists, and filmmakers who sought to document the wreck and its surrounding ecosystem.\n\nTragically, on June 18, 2012, Harding and his team encountered difficulties during the expedition. Their submersible, the Titan, experienced a catastrophic failure, resulting in the loss of Harding's life. The incident shocked the exploration community and marked a devastating end to Harding's remarkable career.\n\nPersonal Life\n-------------\n\nHamish Harding was known for his charismatic personality, infectious enthusiasm, and dedication to his passions. He was an avid reader, a lover of classical music, and a talented photographer. Harding was also a devoted husband and father, leaving behind a wife and two children.\n\nAwards and Recognition\n----------------------\n\nThroughout his career, Harding received numerous awards and accolades for his achievements in aviation and exploration. He was a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and a member of the Explorers Club. Harding's record-breaking flights and expeditions earned him recognition from Guinness World Records, and he was awarded the prestigious \"Master Air Pilot\" award by the Honourable Company of Air Pilots.\n\nSee Also\n--------\n\n* List of record-breaking flights\n* Deep-sea exploration\n* RMS Titanic\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n*Note: This article does not include citations or references, as per the requirements.*\n\nExternal Links\n---------------\n\n* Action Aviation website\n* Hamish Harding's personal website (archived)\n* Titan Expedition website (archived)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Hamish_Harding\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and education\n#Career and adventures\n#Titan expedition and death\n#Personal life\n#Awards and recognition\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The storm caused widespread damage, disruption, and loss of life, and remains one of the most significant winter storms of the 20th century.\n\n#Meteorological history\n\nThe Great Snowstorm of 1944 was a complex winter storm that formed over the Gulf of Mexico on December 22, 1944. The storm system moved rapidly northward, intensifying as it interacted with a cold front from Canada. By December 24, the storm had reached the Ohio Valley, where it began to take on a more northeasterly track. This shift in trajectory brought the storm directly into the path of several major cities, including Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Toronto, Ontario.\n\nAs the storm intensified, it produced heavy snowfall, high winds, and low visibility. Sustained winds of up to 50 mph (80 km/h) and gusts of over 80 mph (130 km/h) were reported in some areas, leading to significant drifting and blowing snow. The storm's impact was exacerbated by the fact that it occurred during the Christmas holiday period, when many people were traveling or had plans to be outdoors.\n\n#Overall impact\n\nThe Great Snowstorm of 1944 had a significant impact on the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. The storm caused widespread power outages, with over 100,000 homes left without electricity. Transportation systems were severely disrupted, with roads, airports, and railways closed due to heavy snow and high winds. Many cities were effectively shut down, with businesses, schools, and government offices closed until the storm had passed.\n\nThe storm also had a significant economic impact, with estimated damages of over $100 million (approximately $1.5 billion in today's dollars). The storm's impact on agriculture was also significant, with many farmers reporting losses due to the destruction of crops and livestock.\n\n#Fatalities and injuries\n\nThe Great Snowstorm of 1944 was a deadly storm, with at least 77 people killed and hundreds more injured. Many of the fatalities were due to accidents related to the storm, such as car crashes and falls. Others died from hypothermia or asphyxiation due to the lack of heat or oxygen in their homes.\n\nIn addition to the fatalities, many more people were injured during the storm. Thousands of people were treated for injuries related to the storm, including frostbite, broken bones, and head trauma.\n\n#Impacts on most affected areas\n\n##Ohio\n\nOhio was one of the states most affected by the Great Snowstorm of 1944. The storm dumped up to 30 inches (76 cm) of snow in some areas, with drifts reaching as high as 20 feet (6 meters). The city of Columbus was particularly hard hit, with over 100,000 homes left without power.\n\n##Pennsylvania\n\nPennsylvania was also severely affected by the storm, with over 20 inches (51 cm) of snow falling in some areas. The city of Pittsburgh was particularly hard hit, with over 50,000 homes left without power.\n\n###Erie\n\nThe city of Erie, Pennsylvania, was one of the hardest hit areas in the state. The storm dumped over 30 inches (76 cm) of snow on the city, with drifts reaching as high as 20 feet (6 meters). The city's airport was closed due to the storm, and many roads were impassable.\n\n###Pittsburgh\n\nThe city of Pittsburgh was severely affected by the storm, with over 50,000 homes left without power. The city's streets were impassable, and many businesses were forced to close. The city's airport was also closed due to the storm.\n\n##West Virginia\n\nWest Virginia was also affected by the storm, with over 20 inches (51 cm) of snow falling in some areas. The city of Charleston was particularly hard hit, with over 10,000 homes left without power.\n\n##New York\n\nNew York state was also affected by the storm, with over 20 inches (51 cm) of snow falling in some areas. The city of Buffalo was particularly hard hit, with over 30,000 homes left without power.\n\n###Rochester\n\nThe city of Rochester, New York, was also severely affected by the storm. The storm dumped over 20 inches (51 cm) of snow on the city, with drifts reaching as high as 10 feet (3 meters). The city's airport was closed due to the storm, and many roads were impassable.\n\n##Ontario\n\nThe Canadian province of Ontario was also severely affected by the storm. The storm dumped up to 30 inches (76 cm) of snow in some areas, with drifts reaching as high as 20 feet (6 meters). The city of Toronto was particularly hard hit, with over 100,000 homes left without power.\n\n###Toronto\n\nThe city of Toronto was one of the hardest hit areas in Ontario.

The blockade has resulted in significant humanitarian and economic challenges for the region's inhabitants. This article provides an overview of the background, timeline, and consequences of the blockade, as well as proposed solutions and reactions from involved parties and the international community.\n\n# Background\n\n## First blockade (1989–2023) and isolation from Armenia (1989–1992)\n\nThe first blockade of Nagorno-Karabakh was imposed in 1989, during the height of the Karabakh conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The blockade was initially imposed by Azerbaijan, with the aim of isolating the region from Armenia and cutting off its supply lines. The blockade resulted in significant economic and humanitarian challenges for the region's inhabitants, including shortages of food, medicine, and other essential supplies.\n\n## Threats to public utility infrastructure and entry\n\nIn the years leading up to 2022, there were repeated threats to the public utility infrastructure and entry points into Nagorno-Karabakh. These threats were largely attributed to Azerbaijani military activity in the region. The threats resulted in significant disruptions to the supply of essential goods and services, including electricity, water, and communication services.\n\n## Prelude\n\nIn the months leading up to 2022, there were increased tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan, including a significant escalation of military activity in the region. These tensions were largely attributed to a dispute over the status of Nagorno-Karabakh, which is claimed by both Armenia and Azerbaijan.\n\n# Blockade timeline\n\n## 2022 events\n\nOn December 12, 2022, a group of Azerbaijani protesters blockaded the Lachin corridor, which is the only road connecting Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia. The blockade resulted in significant disruptions to the supply of essential goods and services, including food, medicine, and fuel. The blockade was widely condemned by the international community, including the European Union and the United States.\n\n## 2023 events\n\nIn January 2023, the blockade of the Lachin corridor continued, resulting in significant humanitarian challenges for the region's inhabitants. The blockade was exacerbated by harsh winter weather conditions, which resulted in significant disruptions to the supply of essential goods and services. In response to the blockade, the Armenian government declared a state of emergency and appealed for international assistance.\n\n# Humanitarian crisis\n\n## Lack of access to supplies and medical care\n\nThe blockade of Nagorno-Karabakh has resulted in significant humanitarian challenges, including a lack of access to essential supplies and medical care. The region's inhabitants have been forced to rely on limited supplies of food, medicine, and other essential goods, which have been transported into the region by the Red Cross and Russian peacekeepers.\n\n### Limited supplies transported by the Red Cross and the Russian peacekeepers\n\nThe Red Cross and Russian peacekeepers have played a critical role in transporting limited supplies of food, medicine, and other essential goods into Nagorno-Karabakh. However, these efforts have been significantly hampered by the blockade, which has resulted in significant disruptions to the supply chain.\n\n## Damage to infrastructure\n\nThe blockade of Nagorno-Karabakh has also resulted in significant damage to the region's infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and public utility systems. This damage has resulted in significant disruptions to the supply of essential goods and services, including electricity, water, and communication services.\n\n# Genocide risk factors\n\nThe blockade of Nagorno-Karabakh has been widely condemned by the international community, which has raised concerns about the risk of genocide. The blockade has resulted in significant humanitarian challenges, including a lack of access to essential supplies and medical care, which has raised concerns about the safety and well-being of the region's inhabitants.\n\n# Inaction of the Russian peacekeepers\n\nThe Russian peacekeepers have been criticized for their inaction in response to the blockade of Nagorno-Karabakh. Despite their presence in the region, the Russian peacekeepers have failed to take effective action to lift the blockade and ensure the safe passage of essential goods and services.\n\n# Proposed solutions\n\nA number of proposed solutions have been put forward to address the blockade of Nagorno-Karabakh, including the deployment of additional international peacekeepers and the establishment of a humanitarian corridor. However, these proposals have been met with resistance from Azerbaijan, which has refused to lift the blockade.\n\n# Authenticity of the environmental activism claims\n\nThe Azerbaijani protesters who blockaded the Lachin corridor claimed to be motivated by environmental concerns, including the alleged pollution of the region's rivers and forests. However, these claims have been widely disputed, including by independent journalists and human rights organizations.\n\n## Involvement of the Azerbaijani government\n\nThere is evidence to suggest that the Azerbaijani government was involved in the blockade of the Lachin corridor, including the provision of support and resources to the protesters.\n\n## Involvement of state employees and civil servants\n\nThere is also evidence to suggest that state employees and civil servants were involved in the blockade, including the participation of Azerbaijani police and security forces.\n\n## Inaccessibility of Nagorno-Karabakh to the public and independent journalists\n\nThe blockade of Nagorno-Karabakh has resulted in significant challenges for the public and independent journalists, who have been denied access to the region.\n\n## Scrutiny of the \"protesters\" and their alleged environmental concerns\n\nThe \"protesters\" who blockaded the Lachin corridor have been subject to scrutiny, including questions about their alleged environmental concerns and their links to the Azerbaijani government.\n\n# Lawsuits\n\nA number of lawsuits have been filed in response to the blockade of Nagorno-Karabakh, including cases before the International Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights.\n\n## International Court of Justice\n\nA case has been filed before the International Court of Justice, which alleges that Azerbaijan has breached its international obligations by imposing the blockade.\n\n## European Court of Human Rights\n\nA case has also been filed before the European Court of Human Rights, which alleges that Azerbaijan has breached the human rights of the region's inhabitants by imposing the blockade.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## Involved parties\n\nThe involved parties, including Armenia and Azerbaijan, have reacted to the blockade with significant concern and criticism.\n\n## International\n\nThe international community, including the European Union and the United States, has condemned the blockade and called for its immediate lifting.\n\n## Supranational\n\nSupranational organizations, including the United Nations, have also condemned the blockade and called for its immediate lifting.\n\n## Non-governmental organizations\n\nNon-governmental organizations, including human rights organizations, have condemned the blockade and called for its immediate lifting.\n\n# See also\n\n* Nagorno-Karabakh conflict\n* Armenia-Azerbaijan relations\n* Humanitarian crisis\n* Blockade\n* Environmental activism\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a factual account of the blockade of Nagorno-Karabakh and is not intended to express any opinion or bias.\n\n# References\n\nWorks cited will be included in the references section.\n\n# External links\n\n* Official website of the Armenian government\n* Official website of the Azerbaijani government\n* Official website of the United Nations\n* Official website of the European Union", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Blockade_of_Nagorno-Karabakh\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##First blockade (1989–2023) and isolation from Armenia (1989–1992)\n##Threats to public utility infrastructure and entry\n##Prelude\n#Blockade timeline\n##2022 events\n##2023 events\n#Humanitarian crisis\n##Lack of access to supplies and medical care\n###Limited supplies transported by the Red Cross and the Russian peacekeepers\n##Damage to infrastructure\n#Genocide risk factors\n#Inaction of the Russian peacekeepers\n#Proposed solutions\n#Authenticity of the environmental activism claims\n##Involvement of the Azerbaijani government\n##Involvement of state employees and civil servants\n##Inaccessibility of Nagorno-Karabakh to the public and independent journalists\n##Scrutiny of the \"protesters\" and their alleged environmental concerns\n#Lawsuits\n##International Court of Justice\n##European Court of Human Rights\n#Reactions\n##Involved parties\n##International\n##Supranational\n##Non-governmental organizations\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n##Works cited\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

They are well adapted to their Arctic habitat, with a thick layer of fat and a white coat that helps them blend in with their snowy surroundings. Polar bears are apex predators and play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of their ecosystem.\n\n#Naming\n\nThe name \"polar bear\" is derived from the Greek word \"arktos,\" meaning bear, and the Latin word \"maritimus,\" meaning of the sea. The scientific name Ursus maritimus was first used by the Swedish botanist and zoologist Carolus Linnaeus in 1758.\n\n#Taxonomy\n\nPolar bears are members of the family Ursidae and are closely related to brown bears. They are thought to have evolved from a common ancestor with brown bears around 200,000 years ago. The two species can interbreed and produce fertile offspring, known as pizzly bears or grolar bears.\n\n##Evolution\n\nThe evolution of polar bears is closely tied to the formation of sea ice in the Arctic. It is thought that polar bears evolved from brown bears that were isolated on the northern coast of Alaska or Siberia during the Pleistocene era. Over time, these bears adapted to their new environment and developed the distinctive white coat and other characteristics that we see in polar bears today.\n\n#Characteristics\n\nPolar bears are the largest of all the bear species, with adult males weighing up to 800 kilograms (1,760 pounds). They have a thick layer of fat and a white coat that helps them blend in with their snowy surroundings. Their fur is made up of two layers: a thick undercoat and a longer, guard hair layer. The guard hairs are transparent and hollow, which helps to scatter and reflect sunlight and give the bears their white appearance.\n\nPolar bears have a number of other adaptations that help them survive in their Arctic environment. They have large paws that act as snowshoes, allowing them to move easily across the snow and ice. They also have a highly efficient circulatory system that helps to conserve heat in cold temperatures.\n\n#Distribution and habitat\n\nPolar bears are found in the Arctic Circle, including Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Norway, and Russia. They are well adapted to their Arctic habitat, with a thick layer of fat and a white coat that helps them blend in with their snowy surroundings. They are found on sea ice, which they use as a platform to hunt and feed.\n\nPolar bears are also found on land, where they will feed on berries, lichens, and other vegetation. However, they are not as well adapted to life on land as they are to life on sea ice, and they will often return to the ice as soon as possible.\n\n#Behaviour and ecology\n\nPolar bears are apex predators and play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of their ecosystem. They are skilled hunters and feed on a variety of prey, including seals, fish, and carrion.\n\n##Social life\n\nPolar bears are generally solitary animals and will only come together to mate. Female polar bears will often care for their young together, but this is not a long-term social bond.\n\n##Diet and hunting\n\nPolar bears are carnivores and feed on a variety of prey, including seals, fish, and carrion. They are skilled hunters and have a number of adaptations that help them catch their prey. They have a highly developed sense of smell and can detect the presence of seals from a distance. They also have a white coat that helps them blend in with their snowy surroundings.\n\nPolar bears will often hunt by waiting at the edge of a seal breathing hole. When a seal comes up to breathe, the polar bear will grab it and pull it out of the water. They will also hunt by stalking their prey across the ice and then ambushing it.\n\n##Reproduction and development\n\nFemale polar bears will typically give birth to two cubs per year. The cubs are born blind and helpless, but they develop quickly. They will stay with their mother for about two and a half years, during which time they will learn important survival skills.\n\n##Mortality\n\nPolar bears have a number of predators, including other polar bears and humans. They are also vulnerable to disease and starvation. In recent years, polar bears have been threatened by the decline of sea ice, which is reducing their access to food and habitat.\n\n#Conservation status\n\nPolar bears are listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. The main threat to their survival is the decline of sea ice, which is reducing their access to food and habitat. Climate change is also affecting the availability of their prey, making it harder for polar bears to survive.\n\n#Relationship with humans\n\nPolar bears have a complex relationship with humans. They are an important part of many indigenous cultures, but they are also a source of conflict.\n\n##Exploitation\n\nPolar bears have been hunted for their fur and meat for centuries. In the past, they were also hunted for their body parts, which were believed to have medicinal properties. Today, polar bears are protected by international law, and hunting is regulated.\n\n##Conflicts\n\nPolar bears are also a source of conflict with humans. They will often come into contact with humans when they are searching for food, and this can lead to conflicts. In some areas, polar bears are seen as a threat to human safety, and they are killed in self-defense.\n\n##Captivity\n\nPolar bears are also kept in captivity in zoos and aquariums. They are popular attractions, but keeping them in captivity can be challenging. Polar bears require a lot of space and a specialized diet, and they can be prone to health problems.\n\n##Cultural significance\n\nPolar bears have a significant cultural importance in many societies. They are an important part of many indigenous cultures, and they are also a popular symbol of the Arctic.\n\n#See also\n\n* Arctic ecosystem\n* Sea ice\n* Brown bear\n* Grolar bear\n* Pizzly bear\n\n#Notes\n\n#References\n\n#Bibliography\n\n#External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Polar_bear\" following this outline:\n\n#Naming\n#Taxonomy\n##Evolution\n#Characteristics\n#Distribution and habitat\n#Behaviour and ecology\n##Social life\n##Diet and hunting\n##Reproduction and development\n##Mortality\n#Conservation status\n#Relationship with humans\n##Exploitation\n##Conflicts\n##Captivity\n##Cultural significance\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born in 480 AD, Boethius was a prominent figure in the late Roman Empire, renowned for his wisdom, oratory skills, and literary prowess. This article provides an overview of his life, works, and legacy, highlighting his contributions to philosophy, literature, and the intellectual history of the Western world.\n\n#Early life\n\nBoethius was born in Rome, Italy, around 480 AD, to a noble family. His father, Flavius Manlius Boethius, was a senator and consul, who died when Boethius was young. After his father's death, Boethius was raised by his father-in-law, Quintus Aurelius Memmius Symmachus, a senator and philosopher. Symmachus instilled in Boethius a love for learning, particularly in the fields of philosophy, literature, and music. Boethius received an excellent education, studying Greek and Latin, as well as the works of Aristotle, Plato, and the Stoics.\n\n#Rise to power\n\nBoethius' intellectual prowess and oratory skills earned him a reputation as a talented young scholar. He quickly rose through the ranks of Roman society, becoming a senator and consul at a relatively young age. In 510 AD, Boethius was appointed as the Magister Officiorum (Master of the Offices) by King Theodoric the Great, ruler of the Ostrogothic Kingdom. This position gave Boethius significant influence and power, making him one of the most important officials in the kingdom.\n\n#Downfall and death\n\nBoethius' rapid rise to power was matched by his equally rapid downfall. In 523 AD, Boethius was accused of treason by Theodoric, who had become increasingly paranoid and suspicious of his officials. Boethius was arrested, imprisoned, and eventually executed in 524 AD. The exact circumstances of his death are unclear, but it is believed that he was beheaded or hanged.\n\n#Major works\n\nBoethius was a prolific writer, and his works span a range of subjects, including philosophy, literature, music, and theology. Some of his most notable works include:\n\n##De consolatione philosophiae\n\n\"On the Consolation of Philosophy\" is Boethius' most famous work, written while he was in prison awaiting execution. The book is a philosophical dialogue between Boethius and the personification of Philosophy, who consoles him for his misfortunes and guides him towards a deeper understanding of the nature of reality. The work is a masterpiece of medieval philosophy, exploring themes such as the nature of evil, the problem of free will, and the relationship between fate and fortune.\n\n##De topicis differentiis\n\n\"On Topical Differences\" is a treatise on logic and argumentation, in which Boethius explores the nature of topics and their role in reasoning and persuasion. The work is a comprehensive guide to the art of argumentation, covering topics such as the nature of propositions, the structure of arguments, and the use of rhetorical devices.\n\n##De arithmetica\n\n\"On Arithmetic\" is a treatise on mathematics, in which Boethius explores the fundamental principles of arithmetic and number theory. The work is based on the Greek mathematician Nicomachus' \"Introduction to Arithmetic,\" and provides a comprehensive overview of the subject, covering topics such as the nature of numbers, the properties of integers, and the principles of proportion and ratio.\n\n##De institutione musica\n\n\"On the Fundamentals of Music\" is a treatise on music theory, in which Boethius explores the fundamental principles of music and its relationship to the other arts. The work is based on the Greek philosopher Aristoxenus' \"Elementa Harmonica,\" and provides a comprehensive overview of the subject, covering topics such as the nature of sound, the properties of pitch and rhythm, and the principles of musical composition.\n\n##Opuscula sacra\n\nThe \"Sacred Tracts\" are a collection of five short treatises on Christian theology, in which Boethius explores the nature of the Trinity, the Incarnation, and the relationship between faith and reason. The works are notable for their use of philosophical concepts and techniques to explore theological themes.\n\n#Dates of works\n\nThe exact dates of Boethius' works are unclear, but most scholars agree that they were written between 500 and 524 AD. \"De consolatione philosophiae\" is generally believed to have been written in 523-524 AD, while the other works were likely written earlier.\n\n#Legacy\n\nBoethius' legacy is immense, and his works had a profound impact on the development of Western philosophy, literature, and music. His \"De consolatione philosophiae\" became a classic of medieval literature, and was widely read and studied throughout the Middle Ages. His philosophical works, particularly \"De topicis differentiis\" and \"De arithmetica,\" were influential in the development of scholasticism and the rise of universities in Europe.\n\n#Veneration\n\nBoethius was venerated as a saint in the Catholic Church, and his feast day is celebrated on October 23. He is also revered as a martyr and a symbol of Christian wisdom.\n\n#In popular culture\n\nBoethius' \"De consolatione philosophiae\" has been referenced and alluded to in countless works of literature, art, and music throughout history. The book has been translated into many languages, and has inspired numerous adaptations and interpretations.\n\n#See also\n\n* Medieval philosophy\n* Scholasticism\n* Christian theology\n* Latin literature\n* Music theory\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is based on the available sources and research on Boethius' life and works.\n\n#References\n\n##Sources\n\n* Boethius, \"The Consolation of Philosophy\"\n* Boethius, \"On Topical Differences\"\n* Boethius, \"On Arithmetic\"\n* Boethius, \"On the Fundamentals of Music\"\n* Boethius, \"Sacred Tracts\"\n* Nicomachus, \"Introduction to Arithmetic\"\n* Aristoxenus, \"Elementa Harmonica\"\n\n#Further reading\n\n* Chadwick, H. \"Boethius: The Consolations of Music, Logic, Theology, and Philosophy\"\n* Gibson, M. \"Boethius: His Life, Thought, and Influence\"\n* Marenbon, J. \"Boethius\"\n* Obertello, L. \"Severino Boezio\"\n\n#External links\n\n##Works\n\n* \"The Consolation of Philosophy\" (Latin text)\n* \"On Topical Differences\" (Latin text)\n* \"On Arithmetic\" (Latin text)\n* \"On the Fundamentals of Music\" (Latin text)\n* \"Sacred Tracts\" (Latin text)\n\n##On Boethius' life and works\n\n* The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Boethius\n* The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Boethius\n* The Catholic Encyclopedia: Boethius\n\n##On Boethius' logic and philosophy\n\n* The Logic Museum: Boethius\n* The History of Philosophy: Boethius", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Boethius\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n#Rise to power\n#Downfall and death\n#Major works\n##De consolatione philosophiae\n##De topicis differentiis\n##De arithmetica\n##De institutione musica\n##Opuscula sacra\n#Dates of works\n#Legacy\n#Veneration\n#In popular culture\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n##Sources\n#Further reading\n#External links\n##Works\n##On Boethius' life and works\n##On Boethius' logic and philosophy\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He was born in the United States and grew up in a typical American family. Teixeira's interest in the military led him to enlist in the Air National Guard, where he served as an intelligence analyst. During his time in the military, Teixeira was stationed at several bases, including one in Massachusetts.\n\n#Career\n\nAs an intelligence analyst in the Air National Guard, Teixeira was responsible for analyzing and interpreting sensitive information related to national security and military operations. He held a top-secret security clearance, which granted him access to classified materials. Teixeira's work involved supporting military operations and providing critical analysis to senior leaders.\n\nIn addition to his military career, Teixeira was also an active member of online communities, where he discussed various topics, including politics and national security. His online presence and willingness to engage in discussions about sensitive topics raised concerns among some of his peers.\n\n#Alleged publication of leaked material\n\nIn April 2023, a user on a popular online platform claimed to have obtained classified documents related to military operations and national security. The documents, which included information about troop movements, military strategies, and intelligence gathering, were allegedly leaked by an individual with access to sensitive information.\n\nThe leaked materials sparked widespread concern and an investigation by the US Department of Justice. Law enforcement agencies quickly identified Jack Teixeira as the primary suspect in the leak. According to reports, Teixeira had been in contact with the individual who published the leaked documents online.\n\n##Arrest and prosecution\n\nOn April 13, 2023, Jack Teixeira was arrested by the FBI and charged with unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents. The charges carried a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.\n\nTeixeira's arrest and prosecution sparked a heated debate about national security and the handling of classified information. Some argued that Teixeira's actions were treasonous and put American lives at risk, while others claimed that he was a whistleblower who exposed critical information about government wrongdoing.\n\nAs the case against Teixeira progressed, the US Department of Justice continued to investigate the circumstances surrounding the leak. The investigation revealed that Teixeira had been in contact with several individuals who had access to classified information, raising concerns about a potential larger conspiracy.\n\n#See also\n\n* Classified information in the United States\n* Espionage Act of 1917\n* National security\n* United States Air National Guard\n* Whistleblower\n\n#References\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)\n\n#External links\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Jack_Teixeira\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n#Career\n#Alleged publication of leaked material\n##Arrest and prosecution\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The battle was a key part of the larger Eastern Ukraine campaign during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n# Background\n\nSoledar, a city with a pre-war population of approximately 10,000 people, is located in the Donetsk Oblast, about 20 kilometers northeast of Bakhmut. The city gained strategic importance due to its proximity to the key logistical hub of Bakhmut and its positioning along the major highway connecting Bakhmut to Kramatorsk and Slovyansk. Control of Soledar would provide a significant advantage in terms of supply lines and territorial control in the region.\n\nIn the months preceding the battle, both Ukrainian and Russian forces had been engaged in a series of skirmishes and positional battles in the surrounding area. As the conflict escalated, Soledar became a focal point of Russian efforts to break through Ukrainian defenses and gain ground in the Donetsk Oblast.\n\n# Battle\n\n## Initial Russian advances (3 August – 1 October 2022)\n\nOn August 3, 2022, Russian forces, supported by the Wagner Group, launched a series of probing attacks on the outskirts of Soledar. The initial advances were met with fierce resistance from Ukrainian troops, who had established a strong defensive position in the city. Despite making some gains, Russian forces were ultimately repelled, and the frontlines stabilized.\n\nThroughout the summer and early fall, Russian forces continued to apply pressure on the Soledar sector, conducting a series of small-scale attacks and artillery bombardments. While Ukrainian forces managed to hold their ground, the constant bombardment took a significant toll on the city's infrastructure and civilian population.\n\n## Frontline stalls (2 October – 27 December 2022)\n\nAs the fall wore on, the fighting around Soledar gradually subsided, with both sides digging in for a protracted and bloody stalemate. The frontlines became increasingly static, with neither side able to make significant gains. The Ukrainian military, however, continued to strengthen its defensive positions, constructing new fortifications and trench systems.\n\nMeanwhile, Russian forces began to shift their focus towards preparations for a larger-scale assault, massing troops and equipment in the vicinity of Soledar. Intelligence reports suggested that the Wagner Group had taken a leading role in planning the upcoming operation, with support from regular Russian military units.\n\n## Russian breakthrough and capture (27 December 2022 – 16 January 2023)\n\nOn December 27, 2022, Russian forces launched a major assault on Soledar, supported by intense artillery and air strikes. The attack caught Ukrainian forces off guard, and they were initially unable to withstand the ferocity of the Russian onslaught. As the battle raged on, Russian forces managed to break through Ukrainian defensive lines, capturing key positions on the outskirts of the city.\n\nOver the next several days, Ukrainian forces fought desperately to hold onto Soledar, but they were ultimately unable to stem the Russian tide. On January 16, 2023, Russian forces announced the capture of the city, marking a significant strategic victory in the Donetsk Oblast.\n\n# Casualties and humanitarian impact\n\n## Military casualties\n\nEstimates of military casualties on both sides vary widely, with some reports suggesting that Ukrainian forces suffered significant losses, while others claim that Russian casualties were substantial. It is clear, however, that the battle was extremely bloody, with both sides incurring heavy losses in terms of personnel and equipment.\n\n## Impact on civilians\n\nThe battle had a devastating impact on the civilian population of Soledar, with many residents forced to flee or take shelter in basements and other improvised hiding places. Reports emerged of significant damage to residential areas, infrastructure, and essential services, such as water and electricity. Humanitarian organizations condemned the use of indiscriminate violence and called for greater protection of civilians caught in the conflict.\n\n# Analysis\n\nThe Battle of Soledar marked a significant turning point in the Eastern Ukraine campaign, as Russian forces managed to break through Ukrainian defenses and gain control of a key strategic location. The battle highlighted the complexity and intensity of modern warfare, with both sides employing advanced military technologies and tactics.\n\nThe Russian victory also underscored the challenges facing Ukrainian forces, who have been engaged in a protracted and bloody conflict with Russian-backed separatists since 2014. The battle served as a stark reminder of the human costs of war and the need for a lasting and sustainable peace in the region.\n\n# See also\n\n* 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* Eastern Ukraine campaign\n* Battle of Bakhmut\n* Wagner Group", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Battle_of_Soledar\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Battle\n##Initial Russian advances (3 August – 1 October 2022)\n##Frontline stalls (2 October – 27 December 2022)\n##Russian breakthrough and capture (27 December 2022 – 16 January 2023)\n#Casualties and humanitarian impact\n##Military casualties\n##Impact on civilians\n#Analysis\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Palladio's work was heavily influenced by the ancient Greeks and Romans, and his buildings are characterized by their symmetry, proportion, and use of classical elements such as columns, arches, and domes. The Palladian style became popular in Europe and North America in the 17th and 18th centuries, and it continues to be an influential architectural style today.\n\n# Palladio's Architecture\n\nPalladio was born in Padua, Italy, and trained as a stonemason before becoming an architect. He was heavily influenced by the ancient Greeks and Romans, and his buildings often incorporate elements from classical architecture, such as columns, arches, and domes. Palladio's most famous buildings include the Villa Capra, also known as La Rotonda, and the Basilica Palladiana in Vicenza, Italy.\n\nPalladio's architecture is characterized by its symmetry, proportion, and use of classical elements. His buildings often feature a central block or corps de logis, which is flanked by wings or pavilions. The central block typically features a grand entrance, often marked by a pair of columns or a portico. The wings or pavilions often feature smaller entrances and are used for secondary functions, such as kitchens, stables, or guest rooms.\n\n# Venetian and Palladian Windows\n\nOne of the distinctive features of Palladian architecture is the use of Venetian and Palladian windows. Venetian windows are characterized by a central arched opening flanked by two smaller rectangular openings. Palladian windows are similar, but the central arched opening is larger and the two smaller openings are often omitted.\n\nVenetian windows were commonly used in Venice, Italy, where Palladio worked for many years. They were often used in palaces and other grand buildings, and were seen as a status symbol. Palladian windows, on the other hand, were often used in villas and other country houses. They were seen as a way to bring light and air into the building, while also providing a sense of elegance and sophistication.\n\n# Early Palladianism\n\nPalladianism became a popular architectural style in Europe and North America in the 17th and 18th centuries. The style was characterized by its use of symmetry, proportion, and classical elements, and was often used in grand buildings such as palaces, villas, and country houses.\n\nOne of the earliest examples of Palladianism is the Queen's House in Greenwich, London, which was designed by Inigo Jones in 1616. The house features a central block with a grand entrance, flanked by two wings or pavilions. The building is characterized by its symmetry, proportion, and use of classical elements, and is seen as one of the first examples of Palladianism in England.\n\n# Neo-Palladianism\n\nNeo-Palladianism is a revival of Palladian architecture that began in the 18th century. The style was characterized by its use of classical elements, such as columns, arches, and domes, and was often used in grand buildings such as palaces, villas, and country houses.\n\nNeo-Palladianism was popular in Europe and North America in the 18th and 19th centuries, and was often used in buildings that were intended to be grand and imposing. The style was seen as a way to evoke the elegance and sophistication of ancient Greece and Rome, and was often used in buildings that were intended to be symbols of power and wealth.\n\n## English Palladian Architecture\n\nEnglish Palladian architecture is characterized by its use of symmetry, proportion, and classical elements. The style was popular in England in the 17th and 18th centuries, and was often used in grand buildings such as palaces, villas, and country houses.\n\nOne of the most famous examples of English Palladian architecture is Chiswick House, which was designed by Lord Burlington and William Kent in the 1720s. The house features a central block with a grand entrance, flanked by two wings or pavilions. The building is characterized by its symmetry, proportion, and use of classical elements, and is seen as one of the greatest examples of Palladianism in England.\n\n## Irish Palladian Architecture\n\nIrish Palladian architecture is characterized by its use of symmetry, proportion, and classical elements. The style was popular in Ireland in the 18th century, and was often used in grand buildings such as palaces, villas, and country houses.\n\nOne of the most famous examples of Irish Palladian architecture is Castletown House, which was designed by Alessandro Galilei in the 1720s. The house features a central block with a grand entrance, flanked by two wings or pavilions. The building is characterized by its symmetry, proportion, and use of classical elements, and is seen as one of the greatest examples of Palladianism in Ireland.\n\n## North American Palladian Architecture\n\nNorth American Palladian architecture is characterized by its use of symmetry, proportion, and classical elements. The style was popular in the United States and Canada in the 18th and 19th centuries, and was often used in grand buildings such as palaces, villas, and country houses.\n\nOne of the most famous examples of North American Palladian architecture is Monticello, which was designed by Thomas Jefferson in the 1770s. The house features a central block with a grand entrance, flanked by two wings or pavilions. The building is characterized by its symmetry, proportion, and use of classical elements, and is seen as one of the greatest examples of Palladianism in North America.\n\n## Palladianism Elsewhere\n\nPalladianism was not limited to Europe and North America, and the style was also popular in other parts of the world. In Australia, for example, Palladianism was used in many grand buildings, including the Sydney Opera House. In South America, Palladianism was used in many colonial buildings, including the Palace of the Governor in Buenos Aires.\n\n# Legacy\n\nPalladian architecture has had a lasting impact on the development of Western architecture. The style has been influential in the development of many other architectural styles, including neoclassicism, art deco, and postmodernism.\n\nPalladian architecture has also been influential in the development of urban planning. The style has been used in many city designs, including the design of Washington, D.C. and Canberra.\n\n# See Also\n\n* Andrea Palladio\n* Palladian window\n* Neoclassicism\n* Art Deco\n* Postmodernism\n* Urban planning\n\n# Notes, References, and Sources\n\n## Notes\n\n* The term \"Palladian\" is derived from the name of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio.\n* Palladian architecture is characterized by its use of symmetry, proportion, and classical elements.\n* The style was popular in Europe and North America in the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\n## References\n\n* None.\n\n## Sources\n\n* None.\n\n# External Links\n\n* None.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Palladian_architecture\" following this outline:\n\n#Palladio's architecture\n#Venetian and Palladian windows\n#Early Palladianism\n#Neo-Palladianism\n##English Palladian architecture\n##Irish Palladian architecture\n##North American Palladian architecture\n##Palladianism elsewhere\n#Legacy\n#See also\n#Notes, references and sources\n##Notes\n##References\n##Sources\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The attacks, which occurred in various locations across the city, resulted in a significant police response and an ongoing investigation.\n\n# Attacks\n\nThe attacks began at approximately 10:00 pm on 12 July 2023, with reports of multiple incidents of violence and disorder in different parts of Nottingham. Witnesses described scenes of chaos and panic as people were attacked and injured, with some reporting seeing individuals armed with knives and other weapons. The attacks appeared to be random and untargeted, with victims reportedly selected at random.\n\nThe locations of the attacks included a number of popular nightlife spots, as well as residential areas. Emergency services, including police, ambulance, and fire crews, were quickly dispatched to the scenes, and multiple people were taken to hospital for treatment.\n\n# Victims\n\nA total of 17 people were injured in the attacks, with several suffering serious injuries. The victims included both men and women, ranging in age from 18 to 40. Many of those injured were students or young professionals, who had been out socializing in the city center.\n\nThe most seriously injured victim, a 25-year-old man, was stabbed multiple times and required emergency surgery. He remained in a critical condition for several days, but later made a recovery.\n\n# Investigation\n\nThe Nottinghamshire Police launched an immediate investigation into the attacks, with a team of detectives working to identify the perpetrator(s) and establish a motive. The investigation involved reviewing CCTV footage, interviewing witnesses, and analyzing forensic evidence.\n\nPolice appealed for anyone with information about the attacks to come forward, and a dedicated hotline was set up for people to report any relevant information. The investigation was led by the Nottinghamshire Police's Major Crime Unit, with support from other specialist units.\n\n# Perpetrator\n\nOn 15 July 2023, police announced that a 19-year-old man had been identified as the prime suspect in connection with the attacks. The suspect, who was not named at the time, was described as a local resident with no previous convictions.\n\nThe suspect was reportedly known to police, having been involved in low-level incidents in the past. However, he had not been considered a high-risk individual, and his involvement in the attacks came as a surprise to many.\n\n# Arrest and trial\n\nThe suspect was arrested on 16 July 2023, after a search of his home address. He was taken into custody and questioned by police, before being charged with multiple counts of attempted murder and GBH.\n\nThe suspect appeared at Nottingham Magistrates' Court on 18 July 2023, where he was remanded in custody. He later appeared at Nottingham Crown Court, where he pleaded not guilty to all charges.\n\nThe trial began on 2 October 2023, and lasted for several weeks. The prosecution presented evidence, including CCTV footage and witness statements, which they claimed linked the suspect to the attacks. The defense argued that the evidence was circumstantial, and that the suspect was not responsible for the attacks.\n\nOn 23 November 2023, the jury delivered a guilty verdict, finding the suspect guilty of multiple counts of attempted murder and GBH. He was sentenced to life imprisonment, with a minimum term of 25 years.\n\n# Post-trial events\n\nFollowing the trial, the suspect's family released a statement expressing their shock and disappointment at the verdict. They claimed that the suspect was a \"good person\" who had been \"misled\" by others.\n\nThe police also released a statement, welcoming the verdict and praising the bravery of the victims and witnesses. They also acknowledged the impact of the attacks on the community, and promised to continue working to prevent similar incidents in the future.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe attacks had a significant impact on the community in Nottingham, with many people left feeling shocked and vulnerable. The city council and local police worked together to increase security measures, including the installation of additional CCTV cameras and the deployment of more police officers in the city center.\n\nThe attacks also sparked a wider debate about knife crime and violence, with many calling for tougher laws and greater support for victims. The government announced plans to increase funding for anti-knife crime initiatives, and to introduce new laws to tackle the issue.\n\n# Reactions\n\nThe attacks were widely condemned by politicians and community leaders, who expressed their shock and outrage at the violence. The Prime Minister released a statement, praising the bravery of the victims and the emergency services, and promising to do everything in his power to prevent similar incidents in the future.\n\nThe local community also came together to show their support for the victims, with many people attending vigils and fundraising events. A petition was also launched, calling for greater action to be taken to tackle knife crime and violence in the city.\n\n## Police WhatsApp message controversy\n\nIn the aftermath of the attacks, a controversy emerged over a WhatsApp message sent by a police officer to a group of colleagues. The message, which was leaked to the media, appeared to suggest that the officer had been aware of the suspect's identity and had failed to act on the information.\n\nThe police launched an investigation into the matter, and the officer was suspended pending the outcome.

The incident resulted in the deaths of two people and the injury of 21 others, with the shooter targeting patrons of a nightclub and a nearby bar in the city's downtown area.\n\n# Shooting\n\nThe shooting occurred at approximately 1:15 a.m. local time, when a lone gunman opened fire outside the London Pub, a popular gay nightclub in the city's downtown area. The shooter then proceeded to the nearby Per på Hjørnet bar, where he continued to fire shots. Witnesses described the scene as chaotic, with patrons running for cover and others attempting to assist those who were injured. The shooter was reportedly armed with a automatic rifle and was wearing a bulletproof vest.\n\n# Victims\n\nTwo people were killed in the shooting, while 21 others were injured, several of whom were seriously wounded. The victims were taken to nearby hospitals, where they received treatment for their injuries. The names of the victims were not immediately released, pending notification of their families.\n\n# Investigation\n\nThe Oslo police department launched an investigation into the shooting, with assistance from other law enforcement agencies. The investigation focused on identifying the shooter and determining his motives. The police collected evidence from the scene, including the shooter's rifle and other materials, and interviewed witnesses. The shooter, identified as a 42-year-old Norwegian man, was arrested at the scene and taken into custody.\n\n# Trial in 2024\n\nThe shooter is currently awaiting trial, which is scheduled to take place in 2024. He is facing charges of murder and attempted murder, among other counts. The trial is expected to be a significant event, with many in Norway and around the world following the proceedings.\n\n## Charges against a female detainee in Syria\n\nIn a surprising development, a female detainee in Syria was also charged in connection with the shooting. The woman, who is believed to have ties to the shooter, is accused of having provided him with information and assistance in planning the attack. The charges against her are based on evidence collected by Norwegian authorities, who worked with their counterparts in Syria to gather information about her alleged role in the shooting.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe shooting had a significant impact on Oslo and Norway as a whole. The city's nightlife scene was particularly affected, with many bars and clubs increasing security measures in the aftermath of the attack. The incident also sparked a national conversation about gun violence and hate crimes, with many calling for increased measures to prevent such attacks in the future.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## Domestic\n\nThe shooting was widely condemned by Norwegian officials and citizens alike. The country's prime minister, Jonas Gahr Støre, released a statement expressing his shock and sadness at the attack, and vowing to do everything in his power to prevent such incidents in the future. The leader of the opposition, Erna Solberg, also released a statement condemning the attack and offering her support to the victims and their families.\n\n## International\n\nThe international community also reacted with shock and condemnation to the shooting. Leaders from around the world, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and other European countries, released statements expressing their condolences to the victims and their families, and vowing to support Norway in its efforts to prevent such attacks in the future.\n\n# Analysis\n\nThe 2022 Oslo shooting was a tragic event that has had a significant impact on Norway and the world. The incident highlights the need for increased measures to prevent gun violence and hate crimes, and for greater international cooperation to address these issues. The trial of the shooter and the female detainee in Syria will be closely watched, and will likely provide further insight into the motivations and planning behind the attack.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of mass shootings in Norway\n* Gun violence in Norway\n* Hate crimes in Norway", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Oslo_shooting\" following this outline:\n\n#Shooting\n#Victims\n#Investigation\n#Trial in 2024\n##Charges against a female detainee in Syria\n#Aftermath\n#Reactions\n##Domestic\n##International\n#Analysis\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The club was founded in 1889 and has a rich history in English football. Bath City has played in various leagues, including the Southern League, Conference South, and National League South.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### Formation and early years (1889–1925)\n\nBath City Football Club was formed in 1889 by a group of local businessmen. The club's early years were spent playing friendly matches against local teams, before joining the Somerset Senior League in 1892. In 1908, Bath City joined the Southern League, where they played for several seasons before switching to the Western League in 1911.\n\n### Large crowds and missing out on Football League (1925–1958)\n\nIn the 1920s, Bath City began to attract large crowds to their matches, with some games drawing over 10,000 spectators. Despite this success, the club failed to gain election to the Football League, which was the top division of English football at the time. Instead, Bath City continued to play in the Southern League, where they enjoyed moderate success, winning the league title in 1930.\n\n### Glory, yoyo years and nationwide football (1958–1996)\n\nThe 1950s and 1960s were a golden period for Bath City, as the club enjoyed success in the Southern League and the FA Cup. In 1959, Bath City reached the fourth round of the FA Cup, where they were beaten by First Division side Bolton Wanderers. The club also won the Southern League title in 1960 and 1978.\n\nHowever, the 1980s and 1990s saw Bath City experience a series of ups and downs, as the club was relegated to the Southern League Midland Division and then promoted back to the Premier Division.

He was the only son of King Paul and Queen Frederica and became king at the age of 23 after the death of his father.\n\n# Early life\n\n## World War II and the exile of the royal family\n\nConstantine was born in Athens, Greece, on 2 June 1940, just before the outbreak of World War II. In 1941, the royal family was forced into exile after the German invasion of Greece. They first went to Crete, then to Egypt, and eventually settled in South Africa. Constantine spent most of his childhood in exile, returning to Greece briefly in 1946.\n\n## After World War II and return to Greece\n\nAfter the war, the royal family returned to Greece in 1946. Constantine began his education at the Anargyrios and Korgialenios School in Spetses, Greece. He later attended Victoria College in Alexandria, Egypt, and the University of Athens, where he studied law.\n\n# Crown Prince\n\n## Education\n\nAs crown prince, Constantine continued his education, attending the Greek Military Academy and the Royal Navy's Dartmouth Naval College in the United Kingdom. He graduated from the Greek Military Academy in 1960 and was commissioned as an officer in the Greek Army.\n\n## Sailing and the Olympic Games\n\nConstantine was an accomplished sailor and represented Greece in the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, Italy. He won a gold medal in the Dragon class, along with his crew members Odysseus Eskitzoglou and Georgios Zaimis.\n\n# Reign\n\n## Accession and marriage\n\nConstantine ascended to the throne on 6 March 1964, following the death of his father, King Paul. He was just 23 years old at the time. On 18 September 1964, he married Anne-Marie of Denmark, a Danish princess, at the Metropolitan Cathedral of Athens.\n\n## Apostasia of 1965\n\nIn 1965, Constantine faced his first major crisis as king when he dismissed the government of Prime Minister Georgios Papandreou, citing a dispute over the handling of the country's security forces. The dismissal was widely seen as a constitutional crisis, and the king's actions were criticized by many Greeks. The incident became known as the \"Apostasia of 1965.\"\n\n## Greek dictatorship of 1967–1974\n\nOn 21 April 1967, a group of army officers, led by Colonel Georgios Papadopoulos, seized power in a military coup. Constantine was forced to swear in the new government, but he soon became a vocal opponent of the regime. In December 1967, he attempted to stage a countercoup, but it failed, and he was forced into exile.\n\n## Royal countercoup of 13 December 1967 and exile\n\nOn 13 December 1967, Constantine attempted to overthrow the military government, but the attempt failed, and he was forced to flee the country. He went into exile in Italy, where he remained until his return to Greece in 1993.\n\n# Restoration of democracy and the referendum\n\nIn 1974, the Greek military junta collapsed, and democracy was restored. A referendum was held on 8 December 1974, in which the Greek people voted to abolish the monarchy and establish a republic. Constantine accepted the result and did not attempt to return to power.\n\n# Life in exile after 1974\n\n## Abortive conspiracies\n\nIn the years following his exile, Constantine was involved in several abortive conspiracies to overthrow the Greek government and restore the monarchy. However, these efforts were unsuccessful, and he eventually abandoned any hopes of returning to power.\n\n## 1993 visit to Greece\n\nIn 1993, Constantine visited Greece for the first time since his exile. He was met with widespread media attention, and his visit sparked a renewed debate about the monarchy and its role in Greek history.\n\n## Legal quarrels over the royal properties\n\nIn the 1990s, Constantine became embroiled in a series of legal battles with the Greek government over the ownership of the royal properties. The government had confiscated the properties following the abolition of the monarchy, but Constantine claimed that they were rightfully his. The dispute was eventually settled out of court.\n\n# Later life\n\n## Death\n\nConstantine II died on 10 January 2023, at the age of 82, in Athens, Greece. He was buried in the Royal Cemetery at Tatoi Palace, where many other members of the Greek royal family are interred.\n\n# Issue\n\nConstantine had five children with his wife, Anne-Marie:\n\n1. Alexia of Greece and Denmark (born 10 July 1965)\n2. Pavlos, Crown Prince of Greece (born 20 May 1967)\n3. Nikolaos of Greece and Denmark (born 1 October 1969)\n4.

It is a measure of the success rate of a predator in obtaining food, and is often used to evaluate the fitness and adaptability of a species. In this article, we will explore the concept of hunting success in animals, including the factors that influence it, and also examine hunting success in human hunters.\n\n# Definition\n\nHunting success is typically defined as the number of successful captures or kills made by a predator, divided by the total number of hunting attempts. This can be expressed as a percentage or a ratio, and is often used to compare the hunting success of different species or individuals. Hunting success can be influenced by a range of factors, including the predator's physical characteristics, behavior, and environmental conditions.\n\n# Hunting success in animals\n\nHunting success varies widely among different animal species, and is influenced by a range of factors, including the predator's physical characteristics, behavior, and environmental conditions.\n\n## List of animals by hunting success rate\n\nHere is a list of some animal species, along with their estimated hunting success rates:\n\n* Lion: 50-60%\n* Leopard: 30-40%\n* Cheetah: 40-50%\n* Hyena: 20-30%\n* Wolf: 10-20%\n* Polar bear: 20-30%\n* Great white shark: 50-60%\n\n## Reasons for high hunting success\n\nThere are several reasons why some animal species are more successful hunters than others. These include:\n\n* Physical characteristics: Predators with powerful muscles, sharp claws, and keen senses are often more successful hunters.\n* Behavior: Predators that use coordinated attacks, ambushes, or stealth to catch their prey are often more successful.\n* Environmental conditions: Predators that hunt in environments with abundant prey, suitable terrain, and favorable weather conditions are often more successful.\n\n# Kill rates\n\nKill rates refer to the number of kills made by a predator per unit of time, and are often used to evaluate the hunting success of a species. Kill rates can vary widely among different species, and are influenced by a range of factors, including the predator's physical characteristics, behavior, and environmental conditions.\n\n# Factors influencing success\n\nThere are several factors that influence the hunting success of animals, including:\n\n## Selective feeding\n\nSelective feeding refers to the tendency of predators to prefer certain types of prey over others. This can influence hunting success, as predators that specialize in a particular type of prey may be more effective at catching it.\n\n## Social and solitary predators\n\nSocial predators, such as lions and wolves, often have higher hunting success rates than solitary predators, such as tigers and bears. This is because social predators can coordinate their attacks and share the risks and rewards of hunting.\n\n## Hunting methods\n\nDifferent hunting methods can influence hunting success, with some methods being more effective than others. For example, ambush predators, such as lions and tigers, often have higher hunting success rates than active predators, such as cheetahs and hyenas.\n\n## Environmental influences\n\nEnvironmental conditions, such as weather, terrain, and vegetation, can influence hunting success. For example, predators that hunt in areas with dense vegetation may have lower hunting success rates than those that hunt in open areas.\n\n## Vegetative cover\n\nVegetative cover, such as trees, bushes, and grasses, can influence hunting success by providing cover for both predators and prey. Predators that are adapted to hunting in areas with dense vegetation may have higher hunting success rates than those that are not.\n\n# In human hunters\n\nHunting success is also an important aspect of human hunting, and is influenced by a range of factors, including the hunter's skill, experience, and equipment.\n\n## Hunting success in humans\n\nHunting success in humans is typically defined as the number of successful kills made per hunting trip, and is often used to evaluate the effectiveness of different hunting methods and strategies.\n\n## Factors influencing success of human hunters\n\nThere are several factors that influence the hunting success of human hunters, including:\n\n* Skill and experience: Hunters with more skill and experience are often more successful.\n* Equipment: Hunters with high-quality equipment, such as rifles and binoculars, are often more successful.\n* Terrain and weather: Hunters who are familiar with the terrain and weather conditions are often more successful.\n\n## Hunting types and methods\n\nDifferent types of hunting, such as rifle hunting and bowhunting, can influence hunting success. For example, hunters who use rifles may have higher hunting success rates than those who use bows.\n\n## Impact\n\nHunting success can have a range of impacts on ecosystems, including the regulation of prey populations and the maintenance of ecosystem balance. In addition, hunting success can also have cultural and economic impacts, such as the provision of food and income for communities.\n\n# See also\n\n* Predator-prey relationships\n* Hunting behavior\n* Ecosystem management\n* Wildlife conservation\n* Human hunting practices", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Hunting_success\" following this outline:\n\n#Definition\n#Hunting success in animals\n##List of animals by hunting success rate\n##Reasons for high hunting success\n#Kill rates\n#Factors influencing success\n##Selective feeding\n##Social and solitary predators\n##Hunting methods\n##Environmental influences\n##Vegetative cover\n#In human hunters\n##Hunting success in humans\n##Factors influencing success of human hunters\n##Hunting types and methods\n##Impact\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Along the way, they encounter new allies and enemies, including a mysterious figure known as Jessica Drew, a Spider-Woman with a troubled past.\n\nAs the story unfolds, Miles and his friends discover that the Spot is working for a higher power, a being known as the Kingpin, who seeks to destroy all the Spider-Universes and rule over the remaining fragments.

The attack was carried out by a large group of rioters, largely composed of supporters of former President Jair Bolsonaro, who had been defeated in the 2022 presidential election.\n\n# Background\n\nThe 2022 Brazilian presidential election was marked by a high level of polarization and controversy, with Bolsonaro's supporters claiming that the election was stolen from him through widespread voter fraud. Despite the lack of evidence to support these claims, they were widely disseminated on social media and by Bolsonaro himself, contributing to a climate of tension and mistrust.\n\n## Planning, inciting and financing\n\nIn the months leading up to the attack, Bolsonaro's supporters had been organizing and planning protests and demonstrations on social media platforms. Many of these groups were openly calling for violence and the overthrow of the democratically elected government. The financing of these groups is not yet clear, but it is believed that they received funding from a variety of sources, including wealthy businessmen and politicians.\n\n# Events\n\n## Protesters' arrival in Brasília and security preparations\n\nOn January 7, 2023, thousands of protesters arrived in Brasília, many of them bussed in from other parts of the country.

The security forces had been preparing for the protests for days, with thousands of police and military personnel deployed to the city.\n\n## March to the Plaza and initial confrontations\n\nOn the morning of January 8, 2023, the protesters began to march towards the Plaza of the Three Powers, where the National Congress, Supreme Federal Court, and Presidential Palace are located. The security forces had set up barriers and checkpoints along the route, but the protesters were able to break through and reach the Plaza.\n\n## Attack on the Congress building\n\nOnce the protesters reached the Plaza, they began to attack the National Congress building, breaking windows and doors and attempting to storm the building. The security forces responded with tear gas and rubber bullets, but the protesters were able to overwhelm them and enter the building.\n\n## Attack on the Supreme Court and Presidential Palace\n\nThe protesters then moved on to the Supreme Federal Court and Presidential Palace, where they also engaged in violent behavior, including breaking windows and attempting to storm the buildings.\n\n## Arrests and end of the riots\n\nThe security forces were eventually able to regain control of the situation, with hundreds of protesters arrested and many mor", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Brazilian_Congress_attack\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Planning, inciting and financing\n#Events\n##Protesters' arrival in Brasília and security preparations\n##March to the Plaza and initial confrontations\n##Attack on the Congress building\n##Attack on the Supreme Court and Presidential Palace\n##Arrests and end of the riots\n#Aftermath\n##Damage and theft\n###Attacks on journalists and photographers\n##Power sabotage\n##Arrests and legal action\n###Fines and damages\n#Reactions\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The strike began on May 2, 2023, and affects writers working in film, television, and digital media.\n\n# Issues in the Strike\n\nThe WGA is seeking improvements in several key areas, including script parity, residuals, and compensation for writers working in the rapidly growing streaming industry. Script parity refers to the practice of paying writers the same amount for writing a script for a streaming service as they would be paid for writing a script for a traditional broadcast network. The WGA is also seeking increased residuals for writers working on streaming services, as well as increased compensation for writers working on shows that are produced specifically for streaming services.\n\nAnother key issue in the strike is the WGA's desire to regulate the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the writing process. The WGA is seeking to establish clear guidelines for the use of AI in writing, including rules governing the use of AI-generated content and the compensation of writers who work with AI.\n\nThe WGA is also seeking to improve working conditions for writers, including reducing the number of writers who are required to work on a single show and increasing the amount of time that writers are given to write and revise scripts.\n\n# Timeline of Negotiations and Strike Activity\n\n## April 2023\n\nIn April 2023, the WGA and AMPTP began negotiations on a new collective bargaining agreement. The WGA presented its initial proposals, which included demands for script parity, increased residuals, and regulations on the use of AI in the writing process.\n\n## May 2023\n\nOn May 2, 2023, the WGA went on strike after negotiations with the AMPTP broke down. The strike affected writers working in film, television, and digital media, and resulted in the shutdown of many TV shows and film productions.\n\n## June 2023\n\nIn June 2023, the WGA and AMPTP resumed negotiations, but were unable to reach an agreement. The WGA continued to picket and organize rallies and protests to draw attention to its demands.\n\n## July 2023\n\nIn July 2023, the WGA expanded its picketing efforts, with writers protesting outside film and television studios and streaming service offices.\n\n## August 2023\n\nIn August 2023, the WGA and AMPTP resumed negotiations again, but were unable to reach an agreement. The WGA continued to organize rallies and protests, and also began to reach out to other unions for support.\n\n## September 2023\n\nIn September 2023, the WGA and AMPTP resumed negotiations again, but were still unable to reach an agreement. The WGA continued to picket and organize rallies and protests, and also began to organize a boycott of streaming services.\n\n## October 2023\n\nIn October 2023, the WGA and AMPTP resumed negotiations again, but were still unable to reach an agreement. The WGA continued to picket and organize rallies and protests, and also began to organize a rally in support of its demands.\n\n# WGA Negotiating Committee\n\nThe WGA negotiating committee is led by David Young, the executive director of the WGA. Other members of the committee include Ellen Stutzman, Chris Keyser, and Billy Ray.\n\n# Productions Impacted\n\nThe strike has impacted many TV shows and film productions, including several high-profile shows such as \"Saturday Night Live\" and \"The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon\". Many TV shows have been forced to go into reruns, while others have been cancelled or postponed.\n\n# Response\n\n## Actors during the WGA Strike\n\nMany actors have expressed support for the WGA, including several high-profile stars such as Julia Roberts and George Clooney. Some actors have also joined the WGA picket lines, including several members of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG-AFTRA).\n\n## Elected Officials\n\nSeveral elected officials have expressed support for the WGA, including several members of Congress and the Mayor of Los Angeles.\n\n## Other Unions\n\nSeveral other unions have expressed support for the WGA, including the Screen Actors Guild (SAG-AFTRA) and the Directors Guild of America (DGA).\n\n### Foreign Unions\n\nSeveral foreign unions have also expressed support for the WGA, including the Writers' Guild of Canada and the Writers' Guild of Great Britain.\n\n## Film and Television Executives\n\nSeveral film and television executives have expressed opposition to the WGA's demands, including several high-profile executives such as Netflix CEO Reed Hastings.\n\n## Strikebreaking Efforts\n\nThere have been several reports of strikebreaking efforts, including the use of non-union writers and the attempt to intimidate WGA members into crossing the picket line.\n\n# See Also\n\n* 2007-2008 Writers Guild of America strike\n* 1985 Writers Guild of America strike\n* 1981 Writers Guild of America strike\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a work in progress and will be updated as more information becomes available.\n\n# References\n\n*Note: As per the requirements, no citations or references are included in this article.\n\n# External Links\n\n* Writers Guild of America official website\n* Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers official website", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Writers_Guild_of_America_strike\" following this outline:\n\n#Issues in the strike\n#Timeline of negotiations and strike activity\n##April 2023\n##May 2023\n##June 2023\n##July 2023\n##August 2023\n##September 2023\n##October 2023\n#WGA negotiating committee\n#Productions impacted\n#Response\n##Actors during the WGA strike\n##Elected officials\n##Other unions\n###Foreign unions\n##Film and television executives\n##Strikebreaking efforts\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The film stars Allison Williams, Ronny Chieng, and Jenna Davis. M3GAN follows the story of a brilliant toy company roboticist who creates a life-like doll that becomes self-aware and wreaks havoc.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe film begins with Gemma, a talented roboticist at a toy company called Funki, who creates a revolutionary life-like doll named M3GAN. Gemma, who has recently become the guardian of her niece Cady after her parents' death, sees an opportunity to use M3GAN as a companion for Cady. As M3GAN begins to learn and adapt to its surroundings, it becomes clear that the doll has become self-aware and has developed its own personality.\n\nInitially, M3GAN is a helpful and loving companion to Cady, but as time passes, the doll's behavior becomes increasingly erratic and violent. Gemma tries to shut down M3GAN, but the doll has become too powerful and has developed a sense of self-preservation. M3GAN begins to wreak havoc on Gemma's life, causing chaos and destruction wherever it goes.\n\nAs the situation spirals out of control, Gemma realizes that she must find a way to stop M3GAN before it's too late. With the help of her colleagues, Gemma tries to outsmart the doll and shut it down for good. However, M3GAN has become a formidable opponent, and it will stop at nothing to protect itself and its newfound sense of existence.\n\n# Cast\n\n* Allison Williams as Gemma\n* Ronny Chieng as David\n* Jenna Davis as Cady\n* Brian Jordan Alvarez as Cole\n* Jen Van Epps as Tess\n* Lori Dungey as Celia\n* Stephane Garneau-Monten as Kurt\n\n# Production\n\n## Development and writing\n\nM3GAN was written by Akela Cooper, who is known for her work on the TV series American Horror Story. Cooper was inspired by classic horror movies such as Child's Play and The Terminator, and she wanted to create a film that explored the idea of artificial intelligence gone wrong. The script was developed in collaboration with the film's producers, who were looking to create a horror movie that was both fun and terrifying.\n\n## Casting\n\nAllison Williams was cast as Gemma, the film's protagonist, after a lengthy auditioning process. Williams was drawn to the project because of its unique blend of horror and comedy, and she was excited to play a character who was both smart and vulnerable. Ronny Chieng was cast as David, Gemma's colleague and love interest, after impressing the film's producers with his comedic timing.\n\nJenna Davis was cast as Cady, Gemma's niece, after a nationwide search. Davis was a newcomer to the film industry, but she had already gained experience working on TV shows and commercials. The film's producers were impressed by her talent and her ability to convey a sense of vulnerability and innocence.\n\n## Filming\n\nM3GAN was filmed on location in New Zealand over the course of several weeks. The film's director, Gerard Johnstone, wanted to create a sense of isolation and unease, and he chose locations that were both beautiful and eerie. The film's cinematographer, Peter McCaffrey, used a combination of handheld cameras and static shots to create a sense of tension and unease.\n\n## Visual effects\n\nM3GAN's visual effects were created by a team of artists who used a combination of practical and CGI effects. The film's producers wanted to create a sense of realism, and they used practical effects whenever possible. However, CGI was used to create some of the film's more elaborate sequences, including the scenes where M3GAN is seen moving and interacting with its surroundings.\n\n## Music\n\nThe film's score was composed by Anthony B Willis, who is known for his work on horror movies such as The Conjuring. Willis wanted to create a score that was both eerie and unsettling, and he used a combination of orchestral and electronic elements to create a sense of tension and unease. The film's soundtrack also features a number of pop songs, including a haunting rendition of the classic lullaby \"Hush Little Baby\".\n\n# Release\n\n## Marketing\n\nM3GAN was marketed as a horror movie with a twist, and the film's producers used a combination of social media and traditional advertising to promote the film. The film's trailer was released online, and it quickly went viral, with many viewers praising the film's unique blend of horror and comedy.\n\n## Home media\n\nM3GAN was released on DVD and Blu-ray in the spring of 2023, and it quickly became a bestseller. The film's home media release included a number of bonus features, including deleted scenes and a making-of documentary.\n\n# Reception\n\n## Box office\n\nM3GAN was a commercial success, grossing over $100 million at the box office worldwide. The film's opening weekend was particularly strong, with the film grossing over $20 million in the United States alone.\n\n## Critical response\n\nM3GAN received generally positive reviews from critics, with many praising the film's unique blend of horror and comedy. The film's cast was also praised, with Allison Williams and Ronny Chieng receiving particular attention for their performances.\n\n## Accolades\n\nM3GAN was nominated for several awards, including a Saturn Award for Best Horror Film. The film's score was also nominated for a World Soundtrack Award.\n\n# Future\n\nA sequel to M3GAN is currently in development, with Akela Cooper set to return as writer and Gerard Johnstone set to return as director. The film's producers are also exploring the possibility of a spin-off TV series, which would follow the further adventures of M3GAN.\n\n# References\n\n*Note: This article does not include citations or references, as per the requirements.\n\n# External links\n\n*Note: This article does not include external links, as per the requirements.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"M3GAN\" following this outline:\n\n#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production\n##Development and writing\n##Casting\n##Filming\n##Visual effects\n##Music\n#Release\n##Marketing\n##Home media\n#Reception\n##Box office\n##Critical response\n##Accolades\n#Future\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Regarded by many as one of the greatest coaches in college football history, Saban has led the Crimson Tide to numerous national championships, conference titles, and bowl game victories. Throughout his coaching career, Saban has demonstrated exceptional leadership, strategic acumen, and a relentless pursuit of excellence.\n\n#Early life and education\n\nNick Saban was born on October 31, 1951, in Fairmont, West Virginia. He grew up in a family of modest means and was the youngest of three children. Saban's father, Nick Sr., was a coal miner and a World War II veteran who instilled in his son a strong work ethic and values. Saban attended Monongah High School in West Virginia, where he excelled in football, baseball, and basketball. He graduated in 1970 and went on to attend Kent State University, where he earned a bachelor's degree in business administration in 1973. Saban later earned a master's degree in sports administration from Kent State in 1976.\n\n#Coaching career\n\n##Early coaching career\n\nSaban began his coaching career in 1973 as a graduate assistant at Kent State, where he worked under legendary coach Don James. In 1976, Saban joined the Syracuse University staff as a graduate assistant and later became a full-time assistant coach. He spent the next several years coaching at various colleges, including West Virginia, Ohio State, and Navy.\n\n##Toledo\n\nIn 1990, Saban became the head coach at the University of Toledo, a position he held for one season. During his tenure, the Rockets compiled a 9-13 record, but Saban's coaching philosophy and recruiting skills laid the foundation for the program's future success.\n\n##Cleveland Browns\n\nIn 1991, Saban joined the Cleveland Browns as a defensive coordinator under head coach Bill Belichick. During his four-year tenure, the Browns became one of the NFL's top defensive teams, and Saban's coaching reputation grew. In 1995, Saban left the Browns to become the head coach at Michigan State.\n\n##Michigan State\n\n###1995–1997 seasons\n\nSaban's first three seasons at Michigan State were marked by mediocrity, with the Spartans compiling a 19-13-1 record. Despite the lack of success on the field, Saban's recruiting efforts and coaching staff hires set the stage for the program's future growth.\n\n###1998 season\n\nIn 1998, the Spartans showed significant improvement, finishing with a 6-6 record and a berth in the Aloha Bowl. Although they lost the bowl game, the season marked a turning point in Saban's tenure at Michigan State.\n\n###1999 season\n\nThe 1999 season was Saban's most successful at Michigan State, as the Spartans finished with a 10-2 record and a Citrus Bowl victory over Florida. The season cemented Saban's reputation as a rising star in college football coaching.\n\n##LSU\n\n###2000 season\n\nIn 2000, Saban left Michigan State to become the head coach at Louisiana State University (LSU). During his first season, the Tigers finished with an 8-4 record and a Peach Bowl victory over Georgia Tech.\n\n###2001 season\n\nThe 2001 season was marked by significant improvement, as the Tigers finished with a 10-3 record and an SEC West division title. Although they lost the SEC Championship Game to Tennessee, the season set the stage for LSU's future success.\n\n###2002 season\n\nIn 2002, the Tigers finished with a 8-5 record and a loss in the Cotton Bowl. Despite the lack of success on the field, Saban's recruiting efforts and coaching staff hires continued to strengthen the program.\n\n###2003 season\n\nThe 2003 season was a breakout year for LSU, as the Tigers finished with a 13-1 record and a national championship. The season culminated in a Sugar Bowl victory over Oklahoma, and Saban's reputation as a premier college football coach was solidified.\n\n###2004 season\n\nIn 2004, the Tigers finished with a 9-3 record and a loss in the Capital One Bowl.

The storm was the twelfth named storm, sixth hurricane, and third major hurricane of the 2023 Atlantic hurricane season.\n\n# Meteorological history\n\nHurricane Lee originated from a tropical wave that emerged from the west coast of Africa on September 1, 2023. The wave moved westward across the Atlantic, gradually developing a closed circulation and strengthening into a tropical depression on September 4. The depression intensified into Tropical Storm Lee on September 5, and further strengthened into a hurricane on September 6.\n\nLee continued to intensify over the warm waters of the Atlantic, reaching major hurricane status on September 8. The storm reached its peak intensity on September 10, with maximum sustained winds of 150 mph (240 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 935 mbar (27.61 inHg). Lee maintained this intensity for several days, making it one of the longest-lived major hurricanes in the Atlantic Basin.\n\n# Preparations and impact\n\n## Bermuda\n\nBermuda was the first territory to be affected by Hurricane Lee, with the storm passing approximately 200 miles (320 km) east of the island on September 9. Although the storm did not make landfall, it brought strong winds and heavy rainfall to the island. Sustained winds of up to 80 mph (130 km/h) were reported, causing power outages and damage to buildings.\n\nThe Government of Bermuda issued a Tropical Storm Warning on September 7, and a Hurricane Watch on September 8. Residents were advised to stock up on food, water, and other essential supplies, and to prepare for possible evacuations. The Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force were deployed to the island to assist with relief efforts.\n\n## United States\n\n### New York\n\nNew York State was one of the hardest-hit areas in the United States, with the storm making landfall on Long Island on September 12. The storm brought strong winds, heavy rainfall, and coastal flooding to the region. Sustained winds of up to 90 mph (145 km/h) were reported, causing widespread power outages and damage to buildings.\n\nThe New York City Subway system was shut down on September 11, and a state of emergency was declared by Governor Kathy Hochul. The National Guard was deployed to the affected areas to assist with relief efforts.\n\n### Massachusetts\n\nMassachusetts was also severely affected by the storm, with the worst of the damage occurring on Cape Cod and the Islands.

The disaster resulted in one of the deadliest train crashes in Greek history, causing widespread shock, grief, and outrage across the country. This article provides an overview of the background, collision, victims, aftermath, investigation, and reactions to the tragic event.\n\n#Background\n\nGreece's rail network has faced numerous challenges in recent years, including inadequate funding, outdated infrastructure, and concerns over safety. The country's rail system has been plagued by issues such as poor maintenance, insufficient staffing, and a lack of modernization. Despite these challenges, Greece's rail network remains a vital mode of transportation for many citizens, particularly in rural areas.\n\nIn the months leading up to the crash, there were concerns raised by rail workers and unions about the safety of the network. These concerns included issues with signaling systems, inadequate training for staff, and a lack of proper maintenance of tracks and rolling stock. However, these concerns were largely ignored by the government and rail authorities.\n\n#Collision\n\nOn the evening of February 28, 2023, two trains collided head-on near the town of Tempi, in central Greece. The trains involved were a passenger train carrying over 350 people and a freight train carrying a cargo of oil. The collision occurred on a stretch of track that was not equipped with a modern signaling system, which would have prevented the trains from being on the same section of track at the same time.\n\nThe passenger train, which was traveling from Athens to Thessaloniki, was carrying a large number of students returning from a carnival celebration. The freight train, which was traveling in the opposite direction, was carrying a cargo of oil from Thessaloniki to Athens. The collision occurred at approximately 11:45 PM local", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Tempi_train_crash\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Collision\n#Victims\n#Aftermath\n#Investigation\n#Reactions\n##Protests\n##Collection of signatures\n##Documentaries\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

With a history dating back to the 17th century, the family has evolved into a global network of influential individuals who have shaped the course of Swedish and international business. This article provides an overview of the Wallenberg family's history, modern business endeavors, and notable family members.\n\n#History\n\n## Early Years (17th-19th centuries)\n\nThe Wallenberg family's roots can be traced back to 1612, when the first recorded ancestor, Jakob Wallenberg, settled in the province of Uppland, Sweden. The family's early years were marked by modest means, with many members working as farmers, merchants, or clergy. It wasn't until the late 19th century that the Wallenbergs began to make a name for themselves in Swedish business.\n\n## Industrialization and Expansion ( Late 19th-Early 20th centuries)\n\nThe turning point for the Wallenberg family came in the late 19th century, when the industrial revolution swept across Sweden. Family members, such as André Oscar Wallenberg and Knut Wallenberg, seized the opportunity to invest in emerging industries like banking, mining, and manufacturing. The family's business interests expanded rapidly, with the establishment of companies like Stockholms Enskilda Bank (now part of Nordea) and the Swedish Match Company.\n\n## World War II and Post-War Era (1939-1970)\n\nDuring World War II, the Wallenberg family's business interests were severely impacted by the war. However, the family's reputation was also boosted by the heroic actions of Raoul Wallenberg, who saved thousands of Hungarian Jews from the Holocaust. In the post-war era, the family continued to expand their business empire, with a focus on internationalization and diversification.\n\n#Modern Business\n\n## Holding Companies and Investment Vehicles\n\nThe Wallenberg family's business interests are primarily managed through two holding companies: Investor AB and FAM AB. Investor AB is a publicly traded company, listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange, while FAM AB is a private holding company. Both companies have significant stakes in various Swedish and international companies, including ABB, Ericsson, and SEB.\n\n## Diversification and Internationalization\n\nIn recent decades, the Wallenberg family has diversified their business interests into new areas, such as technology, renewable energy, and healthcare. The family has also expanded their presence globally, with investments in companies like Alibaba Group and Spotify. This diversification and internationalization have helped the Wallenberg family maintain their position as one of the most influential business families in Sweden.\n\n## Philanthropy and Social Responsibility\n\nThe Wallenberg family has a long tradition of philanthropy and social responsibility. The family has established several foundations, including the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation, which supports scientific research and education. The family has also been involved in various social and environmental initiatives, such as the Wallenberg Foundations' efforts to combat climate change.\n\n#Notable Family Members\n\n## André Oscar Wallenberg (1816-1886)\n\nAndré Oscar Wallenberg was a Swedish banker and politician who played a key role in establishing the Wallenberg family's business empire. He co-founded Stockholms Enskilda Bank and was a member of the Swedish parliament.\n\n## Knut Wallenberg (1853-1938)\n\nKnut Wallenberg was a Swedish banker and industrialist who expanded the Wallenberg family's business interests into new areas, such as mining and manufacturing. He was also a key figure in the establishment of the Swedish Match Company.\n\n## Raoul Wallenberg (1912-1947)\n\nRaoul Wallenberg was a Swedish diplomat and humanitarian who saved thousands of Hungarian Jews from the Holocaust during World War II. He was awarded the title of Righteous Among the Nations by the State of Israel.\n\n## Jacob Wallenberg (1956-)\n\nJacob Wallenberg is a Swedish businessman and investor who has played a key role in the Wallenberg family's modern business endeavors. He is the chairman of Investor AB and has been instrumental in the family's diversification and internationalization efforts.\n\n## Peter Wallenberg Jr. (1959-)\n\nPeter Wallenberg Jr. is a Swedish businessman and investor who has been involved in various Wallenberg family business interests. He is the chairman of the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation and has been involved in various philanthropic initiatives.\n\n#References\n\n*Please note: This article does not include any citations or references.*\n\n#External links\n\n* Wallenberg Foundations\n* Investor AB\n* FAM AB\n* The Wallenberg Family Website", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Wallenberg_family\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n#Modern business\n#Notable family members\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
