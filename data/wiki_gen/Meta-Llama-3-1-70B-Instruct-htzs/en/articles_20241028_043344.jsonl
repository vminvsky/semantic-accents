His cases have garnered significant media attention due to the brutality of the crimes and his subsequent prison escape in 2023.\n\n#Early life\n\nDanilo Cavalcante was born in Brazil, with little information available about his childhood, family, or upbringing. His life took a turn for the worse when he became involved in a life of crime, which would eventually lead to his notoriety.\n\n#Alleged 2017 murder of Valter Júnior Moreira dos Reis\n\nIn 2017, Cavalcante was accused of murdering Valter Júnior Moreira dos Reis, a Brazilian man whose body was found in a forested area. The investigation suggested that Cavalcante was involved in the crime, but he denied any wrongdoing. The case drew widespread attention in Brazil due to the brutality of the crime and the lack of leads in the investigation. Although Cavalcante was the primary suspect, he was not convicted due to insufficient evidence.\n\n#Escape to the United States\n\nFollowing the investigation into the murder of Valter Júnior Moreira dos Reis, Cavalcante fled to the United States, where he lived under an assumed identity. During his time in the US, he managed to evade law enforcement and continue his life without drawing attention to himself. However, his life of crime eventually caught up with him.\n\n#2021 murder of Deborah Brandão\n\nOn January 1, 2021, Cavalcante was arrested and charged with the murder of Deborah Brandão, a 19-year-old woman whose body was found in an apartment in Orange County, Florida. The investigation revealed that Cavalcante had a prior relationship with the victim and had a history of domestic violence. He was subsequently convicted of the crime and sentenced to life in prison.\n\n#2023 prison escape\n\nOn January 31, 2023, Cavalcante escaped from the Orange County Jail in Florida, where he was being held for the murder of Deborah Brandão. The escape was described as a \"sophisticated\" plan, with Cavalcante using a homemade tool to break free from his cell and then escaping through a ventilation shaft.\n\n##Manhunt\n\nFollowing the escape, a massive manhunt was launched to capture Cavalcante. The Orange County Sheriff's Office, along with the US Marshals Service, launched a search effort that included air and ground units. The manhunt was extensive, with authorities searching for Cavalcante in several counties across Florida.\n\n##Capture\n\nOn February 10, 2023, Cavalcante was captured in a wooded area in Osceola County, Florida, after a tip from a local resident led authorities to his location. He was taken into custody without incident and was subsequently returned to the Orange County Jail.\n\n##Aftermath\n\nThe escape and subsequent capture of Cavalcante raised concerns about the security of the Orange County Jail and the protocols in place to prevent such incidents. An investigation was launched to determine how Cavalcante was able to escape and what measures could be taken to prevent similar incidents in the future.\n\n#Notes\n\nDanilo Cavalcante's case has been the subject of widespread media attention due to the brutality of his crimes and his ability to evade law enforcement. His prison escape in 2023 highlighted the need for improved security measures in correctional facilities and the importance of effective communication between law enforcement agencies.\n\n#References", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Danilo_Cavalcante\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n#Alleged 2017 murder of Valter Júnior Moreira dos Reis\n#Escape to the United States\n#2021 murder of Deborah Brandão\n#2023 prison escape\n##Manhunt\n##Capture\n##Aftermath\n#Notes\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This article provides an overview of the book's key aspects, exploring its background and literary references, form and content, and reception.\n\n#Overview\n\nIJP_The_Book_of_Surfaces is a multidisciplinary work that combines text and image to create a rich tapestry of meaning. The book's use of language, imagery, and layout challenges readers to reconsider their relationship with the written word and the world around them. Through its innovative structure and content, IJP_The_Book_of_Surfaces invites readers to engage with the text on multiple levels, from the literal to the metaphorical.\n\n#Background and literary references\n\nIJP_The_Book_of_Surfaces draws on a wide range of literary and cultural influences, from modernist poetry to postmodern theory. The book's use of fragmented narratives, multiple voices, and playful language nods to the works of James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, and other modernist writers. At the same time, its exploration of the relationship between language, identity, and reality reflects the ideas of postmodern thinkers like Jacques Derrida and Michel Foucault.\n\nThe book also engages with the traditions of avant-garde poetry and visual art, drawing on the works of artists like Marcel Duchamp, Kurt Schwitters, and Hannah Höch. Its use of collage, fragmentation, and juxtaposition reflects the experimental spirit of these artists, who sought to challenge conventional notions of art and representation.\n\n##Influence of postmodern theory\n\nIJP_The_Book_of_Surfaces reflects the influence of postmodern theory in its exploration of the relationship between language, identity, and reality. The book's use of multiple voices, fragmented narratives, and playful language challenges the notion of a stable, coherent self, instead embracing the fragmented and provisional nature of identity.\n\nThis approach reflects the ideas of postmodern thinkers like Jacques Derrida, who argued that language is inherently unstable and that meaning is always in flux. The book's use of language and imagery also nods to the concept of \" différance,\" or the way in which meaning is constantly deferred and differentiated through language.\n\n##Influence of avant-garde art\n\nIJP_The_Book_of_Surfaces draws on the traditions of avant-garde art, particularly in its use of collage, fragmentation, and juxtaposition. The book's use of visual imagery and layout reflects the experimental spirit of artists like Marcel Duchamp, Kurt Schwitters, and Hannah Höch, who sought to challenge conventional notions of art and representation.\n\nThe book's use of collage and fragmentation also nods to the concept of \" détournement,\" or the act of turning familiar images and texts against themselves. This approach reflects the ideas of Situationist International, a group of artists and writers who sought to challenge the dominant ideologies of modern society.\n\n#Form and content\n\nIJP_The_Book_of_Surfaces is characterized by its innovative use of form and content. The book's text is fragmented and disjointed, reflecting the provisional nature of identity and reality. Its use of multiple voices, narrative threads, and poetic forms creates a rich tapestry of meaning, inviting readers to engage with the text on multiple levels.\n\n##Language and imagery\n\nThe book's language is playful and inventive, drawing on a wide range of linguistic and cultural references. Its use of imagery and metaphor reflects the provisional nature of reality, creating a sense of uncertainty and ambiguity.\n\nThe book's visual imagery is equally striking, combining elements of photography, collage, and illustration to create a unique and thought-provoking visual landscape. Its use of layout and design reflects the experimental spirit of avant-garde art, challenging readers to reconsider their relationship with the written word and the world around them.\n\n##Structure and narrative\n\nThe book's structure is fragmented and disjointed, reflecting the provisional nature of identity and reality. Its use of multiple narrative threads and poetic forms creates a sense of uncertainty and ambiguity, inviting readers to engage with the text on multiple levels.\n\nThe book's narrative is similarly complex, drawing on a wide range of cultural and literary references. Its use of multiple voices and narrative threads reflects the provisional nature of identity, creating a sense of uncertainty and ambiguity.\n\n#Reception\n\nIJP_The_Book_of_Surfaces has received widespread critical acclaim for its innovative use of form and content. Reviewers have praised the book's playful language, inventive imagery, and experimental structure, noting its ability to challenge readers' assumptions about the nature of reality and identity.\n\nThe book has also been praised for its intellectual curiosity and cultural relevance, reflecting the ideas of postmodern theory and avant-garde art. Its use of multiple voices, narrative threads, and poetic forms has been praised for its ability to create a rich tapestry of meaning, inviting readers to engage with the text on multiple levels.\n\n##Critical response\n\nReviewers have praised the book's innovative use of form and content, noting its ability to challenge readers' assumptions about the nature of reality and identity.

The group's origins date back to the 1970s, and they have been involved in various forms of crime, including extortion, money laundering, and narcotics trafficking. The syndicate's activities have been the subject of extensive media coverage and law enforcement investigations over the years.\n\n# Background\n\nThe Clerkenwell crime syndicate emerged in the 1970s, in the midst of a wave of gangland violence and turf wars in London. The group's early activities were centered around extortion, with members targeting local businesses and individuals for protection money. As the syndicate grew in power and influence, they began to expand their operations into other areas, including narcotics trafficking and money laundering.\n\nThe syndicate's rise to prominence was largely due to the leadership of the Adams family, who would become the dominant force within the organization. The family's patriarch, Terry Adams, was a charismatic and ruthless leader who was instrumental in building the syndicate's reputation and expanding its operations.\n\n# Personnel\n\n## Terry Adams\n\nTerry Adams, also known as \"Tel,\" is the founder and former leader of the Clerkenwell crime syndicate. Born in 1954, Adams grew up in a family of modest means in Clerkenwell. He became involved in crime at an early age, starting with petty theft and extortion. As he gained experience and built a reputation, Adams began to attract a loyal following of associates and lieutenants who would help him build the syndicate.\n\nAdams' leadership style was characterized by his ruthlessness and cunning. He was known to be merciless towards those who crossed him, and his reputation for violence and intimidation helped to maintain discipline within the organization. Despite his tough exterior, Adams was also known to be charismatic and persuasive, able to build alliances and negotiate deals with other gangsters and businessmen.\n\n## Tommy Adams\n\nTommy Adams, also known as \"Tommie,\" is Terry Adams' younger brother and a high-ranking member of the syndicate. Born in 1958, Tommy Adams followed in his brother's footsteps, becoming involved in crime at a young age. He quickly rose through the ranks of the syndicate, earning a reputation as a skilled and ruthless operator.\n\nTommy Adams was known for his involvement in the syndicate's narcotics trafficking operations, and was instrumental in building relationships with other gangsters and suppliers. He was also known for his volatility and temper, which often led to violent outbursts and conflicts with other members of the organization.\n\n## Patsy Adams\n\nPatsy Adams, also known as \"Patsy,\" is Terry Adams' younger brother and a former member of the syndicate. Born in 1961, Patsy Adams was involved in the organization's early days, but eventually became disillusioned with the lifestyle and left the syndicate.\n\nPatsy Adams' departure from the syndicate was reportedly due to his dissatisfaction with the organization's violent and ruthless tactics. He would later cooperate with law enforcement, providing valuable testimony and intelligence that helped to bring down several high-ranking members of the organization.\n\n# Associates\n\nThe Clerkenwell crime syndicate has had numerous associates and affiliates over the years, including other gangsters, businessmen, and corrupt officials. Some notable associates include:\n\n* John \"The Bull\" McCartney, a notorious gangster and enforcer who worked closely with the Adams family.\n* Michael \"Mick the Fish\" Lawson, a former member of the syndicate who later became a key witness for the prosecution.\n* David \"Davo\" Gould, a businessman and associate of the syndicate who was involved in several high-profile scandals.\n\n# Connections to other gangsters\n\nThe Clerkenwell crime syndicate has had connections to other gangsters and organized crime groups over the years, including:\n\n* The A-Team, a notorious gang from London's East End.\n* The Krays, a legendary gangster family from London's East End.\n* The Richardsons, a powerful gangster family from South London.\n\nThese connections have often been the subject of media speculation and law enforcement investigations, with many believing that the syndicate has maintained close ties with other gangsters and organized crime groups.\n\n# References\n\n*Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements*\n\n# External links\n\n*Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements*", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Clerkenwell_crime_syndicate\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Personnel\n##Terry Adams\n##Tommy Adams\n##Patsy Adams\n#Associates\n#Connections to other gangsters\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The counteroffensive aimed to regain control of territories lost to Russia since the 2022 invasion and to weaken the Russian military presence in the region.\n\n# Background\n\n## State of the war\n\nBy the spring of 2023, the war in Ukraine had been ongoing for over a year, with both sides suffering significant losses. The Russian military had made gains in the eastern and southern regions of Ukraine, but the Ukrainian Armed Forces had managed to hold off the advances and maintain control of key cities, such as Kyiv and Kharkiv.\n\n## Russian defenses\n\nThe Russian military had established a network of defensive lines and fortifications in the occupied territories, including minefields, trenches, and artillery positions. The defenses were designed to prevent a Ukrainian counterattack and to protect the Russian supply lines.\n\n# Prelude\n\n## Planning\n\nThe Ukrainian military had been planning a counteroffensive since the early stages of the war, but the operation was delayed due to a lack of resources and the need to train and equip new troops. By the spring of 2023, the Ukrainian military had made significant progress in preparing for the counteroffensive, including the formation of new units and the acquisition of advanced weaponry.\n\n## Shaping operations\n\nIn the months leading up to the counteroffensive, the Ukrainian military conducted a series of shaping operations, including artillery strikes, drone attacks, and special operations raids, aimed at weakening the Russian defenses and disrupting their supply lines. These operations helped to create a favorable environment for the counteroffensive and to set the stage for the main attack.\n\n# Counteroffensive\n\n## Start date\n\nThe Ukrainian counteroffensive began on June 4, 2023, with a series of coordinated attacks along the southern and eastern fronts.\n\n## Southern front\n\n### Melitopol direction\n\nThe Ukrainian military launched a major attack in the direction of Melitopol, a key city in the Zaporizhzhia Oblast. The attack was led by the Ukrainian 35th Marine Brigade and supported by artillery and air strikes. The Ukrainian forces made significant gains in the first days of the attack, pushing the Russian forces back and retaking several key villages.\n\n### Berdiansk direction: Staromaiorske-Urozhaine\n\nIn the Berdiansk direction, the Ukrainian military launched a series of attacks aimed at retaking the villages of Staromaiorske and Urozhaine. The attacks were led by the Ukrainian 28th Mechanized Brigade and supported by artillery and air strikes. The Ukrainian forces made slow but steady gains in the area, pushing the Russian forces back and retaking several key villages.\n\n## Eastern front\n\n### Donetsk Oblast\n\nIn the Donetsk Oblast, the Ukrainian military launched a series of attacks aimed at retaking the city of Bakhmut and the surrounding area. The attacks were led by the Ukrainian 3rd Assault Brigade and supported by artillery and air strikes.

The storm caused widespread power outages, with over 100,000 households affected. Several buildings were damaged, and a few people were injured.\n\nIn the city of Naha, the capital of Okinawa Prefecture, strong winds knocked down trees and power lines, causing chaos and disruption. The city's airport was closed, and several flights were canceled.\n\n### South Korea\n\nHinnamnor made landfall on the southern coast of South Korea on September 2, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall.

The company has a rich history spanning over a century, with its roots dating back to 1919. Over the years, Edwards Vacuum has evolved through various mergers and acquisitions, becoming a prominent player in the vacuum technology industry.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\n### Independent (1919-1967)\n\nEdwards Vacuum was founded in 1919 by F.D. Edwards as a small, independent company in London, England. Initially, the company focused on producing vacuum pumps and other vacuum-related equipment for the UK market. During the 1920s and 1930s, Edwards Vacuum expanded its product line to cater to the growing demand for vacuum technology in various industries, including scientific research, pharmaceuticals, and food processing.\n\n### BOC (1968-2006)\n\nIn 1968, Edwards Vacuum was acquired by BOC (British Oxygen Company), a leading industrial gases company.

The company introduced new products and technologies, including the iconic \"E2M\" rotary vane vacuum pump, which became a benchmark for the industry.\n\n### Linde and CCMP Capital (2006-2014)\n\nIn 2006, BOC was acquired by Linde AG, a German-based industrial gases company. As a result, Edwards Vacuum became part of the Linde Group. However, in 2007, Linde sold Edwards Vacuum to CCMP Capital, a private equity firm, which continued to operate the company as a standalone entity.\n\n### Atlas Copco (2014-present)\n\nIn 2014, Atlas Copco, a Swedish-based industrial equipment company, acquired Edwards Vacuum from CCMP Capital. Under Atlas Copco's ownership, Edwards Vacuum has continued to innovate and expand its product portfolio, solidifying its position as a leading global player in the vacuum technology industry.\n\nProducts and Markets\n-------------------\n\n### 1950-60s\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, Edwards Vacuum focused on developing vacuum pumps for industrial and scientific applications. The company introduced its first rotary vane vacuum pump, the \"E1M,\" which quickly gained popularity in the market. Edwards Vacuum also began to develop vacuum systems for the emerging field of space exploration.\n\n### 1970s\n\nThe 1970s saw Edwards Vacuum expand its product line to include oil-sealed rotary vacuum pumps, such as the \"E2M\" and \"EH\" series. These pumps were designed for high-performance applications in industries like pharmaceuticals, food processing, and electronics. The company also introduced its first vacuum gauge, the \"APG-100,\" which became a standard in the industry.\n\n### 1980s\n\nIn the 1980s, Edwards Vacuum continued to innovate, introducing its first turbomolecular vacuum pumps, such as the \"EXT\" series. These pumps were designed for high-vacuum applications in industries like semiconductor manufacturing and scientific research. The company also expanded its product line to include vacuum abatement systems, which helped to reduce environmental pollution.\n\n### 1990s\n\nDuring the 1990s, Edwards Vacuum introduced its first dry vacuum pumps, such as the \"iQ\" series. These pumps were designed for applications where oil-free vacuum was required, such as in the pharmaceutical and food industries. The company also expanded its product line to include vacuum systems for the emerging field of nanotechnology.\n\n### Recent\n\nIn recent years, Edwards Vacuum has continued to innovate, introducing new products and technologies like the \"nEXT\" turbomolecular vacuum pump and the \"iH\" dry vacuum pump. The company has also expanded its product line to include vacuum systems for the emerging field of renewable energy.\n\nEdwards Lecture Series\n----------------------\n\nThe Edwards Lecture Series is an annual event organized by Edwards Vacuum, which brings together leading experts in the field of vacuum technology to share their knowledge and insights. The series was established in 2005 and has since become a prominent event in the industry, attracting attendees from around the world.\n\nControversies\n-------------\n\n### Domain Registration\n\nIn 2019, Edwards Vacuum was involved in a controversy surrounding the registration of the domain name \"edwardsvacuum.co.uk.\" The company claimed that the domain name was registered in bad faith and infringed on its trademark rights. However, the dispute was eventually resolved through arbitration.\n\n### Hoffman Instrumentation Supply Inc\n\nIn 2018, Edwards Vacuum was involved in a dispute with Hoffman Instrumentation Supply Inc, a US-based company, over the sale of allegedly counterfeit Edwards Vacuum products. Edwards Vacuum claimed that Hoffman had sold fake products bearing its trademark, causing damage to its reputation and business. The dispute was eventually settled out of court.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nExternal Links\n---------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Edwards_Vacuum\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Independent (1919-1967)\n##BOC (1968-2006)\n##Linde and CCMP Capital (2006-2014)\n##Atlas Copco (2014-present)\n#Products and markets\n##1950-60s\n##1970s\n##1980s\n##1990s\n##Recent\n#Edwards Lecture Series\n#Controversies\n##Domain registration\n##Hoffman Instrumentation Supply Inc\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The film is based on the fairy tale of the same name by Charles Perrault and the Brothers Grimm. It is the 16th Disney animated feature film and the last of the Disney Renaissance films. The movie tells the story of a beautiful princess named Aurora, who is placed under a sleeping curse by a wicked fairy, Maleficent.\n\n#Plot\n\nThe film begins with the introduction of King Stefan and Queen Leah, who are expecting the birth of their daughter, Aurora. The entire kingdom is invited to the christening of the princess, including three good fairies, Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather. However, the evil fairy Maleficent is not invited, and she seeks revenge by casting a curse on the princess. The curse states that on Aurora's 16th birthday, she will prick her finger on a spinning wheel and fall into a deep sleep, from which she will never awaken.\n\nThe three good fairies try to counter the curse by making it so that instead of dying, Aurora will fall into a deep sleep, from which she can be awakened by true love's kiss. The fairies take Aurora to a secret location and raise her as their own, under the name Briar Rose. On her 16th birthday, Aurora meets a handsome prince named Philip, and they fall in love. However, Maleficent discovers the location of the princess and disguises herself as an old hag. She tricks Aurora into pricking her finger on a spinning wheel, which puts her under the sleeping curse.\n\nPrince Philip battles Maleficent and her minions to reach the castle, where he finds Aurora asleep. He kisses her, breaking the curse, and the two are married. The film ends with the entire kingdom celebrating the marriage of the prince and princess.\n\n#Voice cast\n\n* Mary Costa as Princess Aurora/Briar Rose\n* Bill Shirley as Prince Philip\n* Eleanor Audley as Maleficent\n* Verna Felton as Flora\n* Barbara Luderowski as Fauna\n* Barbara Jo Allen as Merryweather\n* Taylor Holmes as King Stefan\n* Bill Thompson as King Hubert\n* Marvin Miller as Narrator\n\n#Production\n\n##Story development\n\nThe story of Sleeping Beauty was first considered as a potential Disney film in the 1930s. However, the project was put on hold due to the success of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937). The film was revived in the 1950s, and Walt Disney himself became heavily involved in the production. Disney wanted to create a film that would surpass the success of Cinderella (1950) and Snow White.\n\n##Casting\n\nMary Costa was cast as the voice of Princess Aurora after a long auditioning process. Costa was a singer and actress who had previously appeared in several films and television shows. Bill Shirley was cast as the voice of Prince Philip, and Eleanor Audley was cast as the voice of Maleficent. The three good fairies, Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather, were voiced by Verna Felton, Barbara Luderowski, and Barbara Jo Allen, respectively.\n\n##Production delays\n\nThe production of Sleeping Beauty was plagued by delays and budget overruns. The film was originally intended to be completed in 1957, but it was not finished until 1959. The delays were caused by a number of factors, including Walt Disney's perfectionism and the complexity of the animation.\n\n##Animation\n\n###Art direction\n\nThe art direction for Sleeping Beauty was led by Eyvind Earle, who was a well-known artist and illustrator. Earle's style was characterized by his use of bold lines, vibrant colors, and intricate details. The film's backgrounds were painted by a team of artists, who used a combination of watercolor and gouache to create the desired effect.\n\n###Live-action reference\n\nLive-action reference footage was used to help the animators create more realistic movements and actions. The footage was shot using a combination of cameras and techniques, including the use of a multiplane camera. The live-action footage was then used as a reference point for the animators, who would draw over the footage to create the final animation.\n\n###Character animation\n\nThe character animation for Sleeping Beauty was led by a team of experienced animators, including Milt Kahl, Frank Thomas, and Ollie Johnston. The animators used a combination of techniques, including hand-drawn animation and cel animation, to create the characters and their movements. The characters were designed to be more realistic and detailed than those in previous Disney films.\n\n##Music\n\nThe music for Sleeping Beauty was composed by George Bruns, who was a well-known composer and arranger. The film's soundtrack features a combination of orchestral and choral pieces, including the iconic \"Once Upon a Dream\" sequence. The music was performed by a 90-piece orchestra, and the soundtrack was released as a separate album.\n\n#Release\n\n##Original theatrical run\n\nSleeping Beauty was released in theaters on January 29, 1959. The film was a major commercial success, grossing over $51 million at the domestic box office. The film was also a critical success, with many reviewers praising its animation, music, and storytelling.\n\n##Re-releases\n\nSleeping Beauty was re-released in theaters in 1970, 1979, and 1986. The film was also released on home video in 1986, and it has since been released on DVD and Blu-ray.\n\n##Home media\n\n###Lawsuit\n\nIn 1986, a lawsuit was filed against Disney by a group of visual effects artists who claimed that they had not been properly credited or compensated for their work on the film. The lawsuit was eventually settled out of court.\n\n#Reception\n\n##Critical response\n\nSleeping Beauty was widely praised by critics upon its release. The film's animation, music, and storytelling were all praised, and many reviewers noted that the film was a major technical achievement. The film holds a 95% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with many reviewers praising its beauty, charm, and timelessness.\n\n##Accolades\n\nSleeping Beauty was nominated for one Academy Award, Best Original Score. The film was also selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress in 2019.\n\n#Legacy\n\nSleeping Beauty has had a lasting impact on popular culture, and it remains one of the most beloved and iconic Disney films of all time. The film's characters, music, and imagery have been referenced and parodied countless times in other films, television shows, and advertisements. The film's influence can also be seen in many other Disney films, including Beauty and the Beast (1991) and Tangled (2010).\n\n#See also\n\n* List of Disney animated feature films\n* List of Disney princess films\n* List of films based on fairy tales\n\n#Notes\n\n#References\n\n#Bibliography\n\n* Barrier, J.M.

Free\n\nKarl R. Free was an American artist, best known for his murals created under the New Deal's Section of Painting and Sculpture program, particularly those commissioned by the United States Post Office Department. His work, often depicting everyday life and landscapes, sought to promote American values and ideals during a time of great social and economic change.\n\n# Early years\n\nKarl R. Free was born in 1903 in New York City. Growing up in a family of modest means, Free's early life was marked by a strong work ethic and a passion for art. He began his artistic training at the Art Students League of New York, where he honed his skills in painting and drawing. After completing his studies, Free worked as a commercial artist, taking on various projects to make ends meet.\n\n# Whitney Museum assistant curator\n\nIn the late 1920s, Free landed a position as an assistant curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City. During his tenure, he was instrumental in organizing exhibitions that showcased the work of American artists, including the likes of Thomas Hart Benton and Grant Wood. Free's experience at the Whitney Museum not only deepened his understanding of American art but also instilled in him a commitment to promoting the country's artistic heritage.\n\n# Post office murals\n\nIn the 1930s, Free was commissioned by the United States Post Office Department to create murals for post offices across the country. This endeavor was part of the New Deal's Section of Painting and Sculpture program, aimed at providing artists with employment and promoting American culture through public art.\n\n## Washington, D.C.\n\n### Creation\n\nIn 1936, Free was tasked with creating a mural for the post office in Washington, D.C. The resulting work, titled \"The Spirit of Communication,\" depicted a group of figures from various professions and walks of life, all engaged in activities related to communication. The mural was meant to symbolize the importance of communication in American society and the role of the post office in facilitating it.\n\n### Reception and objections\n\nUpon its unveiling, \"The Spirit of Communication\" was met with mixed reviews. While some praised the mural's themes and execution, others criticized its perceived lack of representation of African Americans and its depiction of Native Americans in stereotypical attire. These objections highlighted the challenges faced by artists working on public projects, where the need to appeal to a broad audience often conflicted with the desire to tackle complex social issues.\n\n## Princeton, New Jersey\n\n### Creation\n\nIn 1938, Free was commissioned to create a mural for the post office in Princeton, New Jersey. The resulting work, titled \"The Idyllic Village,\" depicted a peaceful scene of rural life, complete with rolling hills, livestock, and villagers engaged in various activities. The mural was meant to evoke a sense of nostalgia and community, reflecting the values of small-town America.\n\n### Reception and objections\n\n\"The Idyllic Village\" was generally well-received by the public, with many praising its serene and idyllic portrayal of rural life. However, some critics argued that the mural glossed over the harsh realities of rural poverty and the struggles faced by farmers during the Great Depression. These criticisms highlighted the tension between the desire to promote a positive image of America and the need to confront the country's social and economic challenges.\n\n# 1939 and beyond\n\nIn the late 1930s, Free's work began to take on a more introspective tone, reflecting his growing concern with the rise of fascism in Europe and the threat of war. His later murals, though still rooted in American themes and ideals, took on a more somber and contemplative quality, as if anticipating the tumultuous years that lay ahead.\n\n# See also\n\n* Section of Painting and Sculpture\n* United States Post Office Department\n* New Deal\n* Great Depression\n* American art\n* Muralism\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is based on the available information about Karl R.

It began on July 8, 1947, when a strange object crashed on a ranch near Roswell, New Mexico, sparking a flurry of rumors and speculation about the origins of the object and the nature of the debris recovered from the site. Over the years, the incident has evolved from a simple story of a crashed military balloon to a complex web of conspiracy theories, hoaxes, and misinformation.\n\n1947 Military Balloon Crash\n---------------------------\n\nOn July 8, 1947, a severe thunderstorm rolled in over the ranch of W.W. Brazel, located about 30 miles southeast of Roswell, New Mexico. The next morning, Brazel discovered a large amount of debris scattered across his property, including metal fragments, plastic materials, and other unusual items. Brazel reported his find to the local sheriff, who in turn notified the military authorities at Roswell Army Air Field (RAAF).\n\nThe RAAF issued a press release on July 8, announcing the recovery of a \"flying disc,\" which was picked up by local and national media. However, the military quickly retracted the statement, saying that the object was actually a weather balloon that had been found. The story was largely forgotten until the 1970s, when it was revived by UFO enthusiasts and conspiracy theorists.\n\nUFO Conspiracy Theories (1947–1978)\n---------------------------------\n\n### Aztec Crashed Saucer Hoax\n\nIn 1948, a man named Frank Scully wrote a series of articles for the Variety magazine, claiming that a flying saucer had crashed on a ranch near Aztec, New Mexico. Scully's story was later revealed to be a hoax, but it helped to fuel public interest in UFOs and extraterrestrial life.\n\n### Hangar 18\n\nThe concept of \"Hangar 18\" originated in the 1960s, as a supposed location where the US military was storing recovered UFOs and extraterrestrial bodies. The idea was popularized by a series of books and articles, but it was later debunked as a myth with no basis in reality.\n\nRoswell Conspiracy Theories (1978–1994)\n--------------------------------------\n\n### The Roswell Incident\n\nIn 1980, a book titled \"The Roswell Incident\" was published, which revived the story of the 1947 crash and sparked a new wave of interest in the subject. The book's authors, Charles Berlitz and William Moore, claimed that the military had recovered a UFO and extraterrestrial bodies from the crash site.\n\n### Majestic 12 Hoax\n\nIn the 1980s, a series of documents emerged, supposedly from the US military, which described a secret project called \"Majestic 12.\" The documents claimed that the project was established to study UFOs and extraterrestrial life, and that the Roswell crash was one of the key events in the project's history. However, the documents were later revealed to be a hoax.\n\n### Role of Glenn Dennis\n\nGlenn Dennis was a mortician who claimed to have been involved in the recovery of extraterrestrial bodies from the Roswell crash site. His story was widely publicized in the 1980s, but it was later disputed by other witnesses and investigators.\n\n### Competing Accounts and Schism\n\nAs the Roswell story gained more attention, different witnesses and researchers began to emerge with competing accounts of the events. Some claimed that the crash was a UFO, while others said it was a military experiment or a natural phenomenon. The competing accounts led to a schism in the UFO community, with different factions promoting their own versions of the truth.\n\n#### UFO Crash at Roswell\n\nIn 1991, a book titled \"UFO Crash at Roswell\" was published, which presented a detailed account of the crash and its aftermath. The book's authors, Kevin Randle and Don Schmitt, claimed that the crash was a UFO and that the military had covered it up.\n\n#### Crash at Corona\n\nIn 1992, a book titled \"Crash at Corona\" was published, which presented a different account of the crash and its aftermath. The book's authors, Stan Friedman and Don Berliner, claimed that the crash was a UFO and that the military had recovered extraterrestrial bodies.\n\n#### The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell\n\nIn 1994, a book titled \"The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell\" was published, which presented a detailed account of the crash and its aftermath. The book's authors, Philip Corso and William Birnes, claimed that the crash was a UFO and that the military had recovered extraterrestrial technology.\n\nAir Force Response\n-----------------\n\nIn the 1990s, the US Air Force issued a series of reports and statements about the Roswell incident, which attributed the crash to a top-secret balloon project called \"Project Mogul.\" The Air Force claimed that the project was designed to detect Soviet nuclear tests, and that the crash was a result of a malfunction.\n\nLater Theories and Hoaxes (1994–Present)\n--------------------------------------\n\n### Alien Autopsy\n\nIn 1995, a film emerged, supposedly showing an alien autopsy from the Roswell crash site. However, the film was later revealed to be a hoax, created by a British entrepreneur named Ray Santilli.\n\n### The Day After Roswell\n\nIn 1997, a book titled \"The Day After Roswell\" was published, which presented a detailed account of the crash and its aftermath. The book's authors, Philip Corso and William Birnes, claimed that the crash was a UFO and that the military had recovered extraterrestrial technology.\n\n### Related Debunked or Fringe Theories\n\nOver the years, numerous other theories and hoaxes have emerged, which have been debunked by investigators and experts. These include claims of a crashed UFO at Socorro, New Mexico, and a supposed government cover-up of extraterrestrial life.\n\nExplanations\n------------\n\n### Project Mogul\n\nThe US Air Force's explanation for the Roswell crash is that it was a result of a malfunction in the \"Project Mogul\" balloon project. The project was designed to detect Soviet nuclear tests, and the crash was a result of a faulty balloon.\n\n### Anthropomorphic Dummies\n\nSome researchers have suggested that the \"alien bodies\" recovered from the crash site were actually anthropomorphic dummies, used in the \"Project Mogul\" experiments.\n\n### Roswell as Modern Myth and Folklore\n\nThe Roswell incident has become a modern myth and folklore, with a wide range of interpretations and explanations. The incident has captured the public imagination, and continues to be the subject of speculation and debate.\n\nCultural Impact\n----------------\n\n### Tourism and Commercialization\n\nThe Roswell incident has become a major tourist attraction, with numerous museums, shops, and restaurants dedicated to the subject. The incident has also been commercialized, with a wide range of merchandise and souvenirs available.\n\n### Popular Fiction\n\nThe Roswell incident has been the subject of numerous books, films, and TV shows, including science fiction and horror stories. The incident has also been referenced in popular culture, including music and comedy.\n\n### Statements by US Presidents\n\nSeveral US Presidents have made statements about the Roswell incident, including Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. However, none of these statements have provided any conclusive evidence or explanations for the incident.\n\nSee Also\n----------\n\n* List of UFO sightings\n* Unidentified flying object\n* Project Blue Book\n* Project Sign\n* Project Grudge\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n* Sources:\n\t+ Books:\n\t\t- \"The Roswell Incident\" by Charles Berlitz and William Moore\n\t\t- \"UFO Crash at Roswell\" by Kevin Randle and Don Schmitt\n\t\t- \"Crash at Corona\" by Stan Friedman and Don Berliner\n\t\t- \"The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell\" by Philip Corso and William Birnes\n\t+ Articles:\n\t\t- \"The Roswell Incident\" by Frank Scully\n\t\t- \"The Day After Roswell\" by Philip Corso and William Birnes\n\nExternal Links\n---------------\n\n* Roswell UFO Museum\n* International UFO Museum and Research Center\n* The Roswell Incident (Wikipedia)\n* Project Blue Book (Wikipedia)\n* Project Sign (Wikipedia)\n* Project Grudge (Wikipedia)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Roswell_incident\" following this outline:\n\n#1947 military balloon crash\n#UFO conspiracy theories (1947–1978)\n##Aztec crashed saucer hoax\n##Hangar 18\n#Roswell conspiracy theories (1978–1994)\n##The Roswell Incident\n##Majestic 12 hoax\n##Role of Glenn Dennis\n##Competing accounts and schism\n###UFO Crash at Roswell\n###Crash at Corona\n###The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell\n#Air Force response\n#Later theories and hoaxes (1994–present)\n##Alien Autopsy\n##The Day After Roswell\n##Related debunked or fringe theories\n#Explanations\n##Project Mogul\n##Anthropomorphic dummies\n##Roswell as modern myth and folklore\n#Cultural impact\n##Tourism and commercialization\n##Popular fiction\n##Statements by US Presidents\n#See also\n#References\n##Sources\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is an alternative to classical set theory, which relies on non-constructive existence proofs and the law of excluded middle. Constructive set theory has its roots in intuitionistic logic, which was developed by L.E.J. Brouwer in the early 20th century.\n\nConstructive Outlook\n-------------------\n\n### Preliminary on the use of intuitionistic logic\n\nConstructive set theory is based on intuitionistic logic, which rejects the law of excluded middle and the law of non-contradiction. In intuitionistic logic, a statement is considered true only if it can be constructively proved, and a statement is considered false only if it can be constructively disproved. This approach to logic leads to a more constructive and explicit approach to mathematics.\n\n### Imposed restrictions on a set theory\n\nConstructive set theory imposes several restrictions on the development of set theory. For example, it rejects the use of non-constructive existence proofs, which are common in classical set theory. Instead, constructive set theory requires that the existence of a mathematical object be established through a constructive proof. Additionally, constructive set theory rejects the use of the law of excluded middle, which is a fundamental principle in classical logic.\n\n### Metalogic\n\nThe metalogic of constructive set theory is based on intuitionistic logic. This means that the metatheory of constructive set theory is itself constructive, and it provides a framework for reasoning about constructive set theory.\n\n### Anti-classical principles\n\nConstructive set theory rejects several anti-classical principles, including the law of excluded middle and the law of non-contradiction. These principles are fundamental to classical logic, but they are not constructive, and therefore they are not accepted in constructive set theory.\n\nHistory and Overview\n-------------------\n\nConstructive set theory has its roots in the work of L.E.J. Brouwer, who developed intuitionistic logic in the early 20th century. Brouwer's work was later developed by other mathematicians, including Arend Heyting and Stephen Kleene. In the 1960s and 1970s, constructive set theory was further developed by mathematicians such as John Myhill and Per Martin-Löf.\n\n### Models\n\nConstructive set theory has several models, including the model of constructive sets developed by Per Martin-Löf. This model is based on the concept of a \"set\" as a collection of objects that can be constructed using a set of rules.\n\nNotation\n--------\n\n### Language\n\nThe language of constructive set theory is based on the language of intuitionistic logic. It includes the usual logical connectives, such as conjunction, disjunction, and implication, as well as the quantifiers \"for all\" and \"there exists\".\n\n### Variables\n\nVariables in constructive set theory are used to represent mathematical objects. They are typically denoted by letters such as x, y, and z.\n\n### Classes\n\nClasses in constructive set theory are collections of mathematical objects that can be defined using a set of rules. They are typically denoted by capital letters such as A, B, and C.\n\n### Extensional equivalence\n\nTwo classes are considered extensionally equivalent if they contain the same elements. This is a fundamental principle in constructive set theory.\n\nSubtheories of ZF\n-----------------\n\n### Equality\n\nEquality in constructive set theory is defined using the concept of extensional equivalence. Two sets are considered equal if they contain the same elements.\n\n#### Alternative approaches\n\nThere are alternative approaches to equality in constructive set theory, including the use of a \" equality relation\" that is not necessarily reflexive or transitive.\n\n### Merging sets\n\nMerging sets is a fundamental operation in constructive set theory. It involves combining two sets into a single set.\n\n### Set existence\n\nSet existence in constructive set theory is established through a constructive proof. This means that the existence of a set must be established using a set of rules that can be applied to construct the set.\n\n### BCST\n\nBCST (Basic Constructive Set Theory) is a subtheory of ZF that is based on the concept of a \"set\" as a collection of objects that can be constructed using a set of rules.\n\n#### Separation\n\nSeparation in BCST is a fundamental principle that states that a set can be separated into two disjoint sets.\n\n#### No universal set\n\nThere is no universal set in BCST, which means that there is no set that contains all other sets.\n\n#### Predicativity\n\nPredicativity is a fundamental principle in BCST that states that a set can only be defined using a set of rules that do not refer to the set itself.\n\n#### Replacement\n\nReplacement in BCST is a fundamental principle that states that a set can be replaced by another set that contains the same elements.\n\n#### Hereditarily finite sets\n\nHereditarily finite sets are sets that contain only finite sets as elements.\n\n### ECST\n\nECST ( Extended Constructive Set Theory) is a subtheory of ZF that is based on the concept of a \"set\" as a collection of objects that can be constructed using a set of rules.\n\n#### Weaker formulations of infinity\n\nECST has weaker formulations of infinity than BCST, which means that it does not require the existence of infinite sets.\n\n#### Number bounds\n\nNumber bounds in ECST are used to establish the existence of sets that contain only a finite number of elements.\n\n#### Moderate induction in ECST\n\nModerate induction in ECST is a principle that states that a property of a set can be established by induction on the number of elements in the set.\n\nFunctions\n---------\n\n### General note

functions that take an input and produce an output that is either 0 or 1.\n\n### Witness of apartness\n\nWitness of apartness in constructive set theory is a function that takes an input and produces an output that is either 0 or 1, depending on whether the input is apart from 0 or not.\n\n### Computable sets\n\nComputable sets in constructive set theory are sets that can be computed using a program.\n\n### Boundedness criteria\n\nBoundedness criteria in constructive set theory are used to establish whether a set is finite or infinite.\n\nChoice functions\n----------------\n\n### Diaconescu's theorem\n\nDiaconescu's theorem in constructive set theory states that the axiom of choice implies the law of excluded middle.\n\n#### Analysis of Diaconescu's theorem\n\nThe analysis of Diaconescu's theorem shows that the axiom of choice is not constructive, which means that it cannot be used in constructive set theory.\n\n#### Regularity implies PEM\n\nRegularity implies PEM (Principle of Excluded Middle) in constructive set theory, which means that the regularity axiom implies the law of excluded middle.\n\nArithmetic\n----------\n\n### Arithmetic functions from

Rock-climbing equipment is designed to protect climbers from falls, provide support and stability, and enable them to ascend and descend rock formations with ease. In this article, we will explore the various types of rock-climbing equipment, their uses, and certification requirements.\n\n# Use and certification\n\n## Type of climbing\n\nDifferent types of climbing require specialized equipment. For example, sport climbing, which involves climbing on bolted routes, requires a specific set of equipment, including quickdraws and ropes. Traditional climbing, on the other hand, requires a more extensive set of equipment, including cams, nuts, and hexes. Ice climbing, which involves climbing on ice formations, requires specialized equipment, such as crampons and ice axes.\n\n## Certification\n\nMany organizations, such as the International Federation of Mountain Guides Associations (IFMGA) and the American Mountain Guides Association (AMGA), offer certification programs for rock climbers and guides. These programs teach climbers how to use equipment safely and effectively, as well as how to assess and manage risk. Certification requirements vary depending on the organization and the type of climbing.\n\n# Ropes and slings\n\nRopes and slings are essential components of rock-climbing equipment. They provide a means of connecting the climber to the rock face, as well as a safety line in case of a fall.\n\n## Ropes\n\nRopes are made of durable materials, such as nylon or polyester, and are designed to withstand heavy loads and abrasion. Climbing ropes come in a range of diameters and lengths, and are typically classified into three categories: single ropes, double ropes, and twin ropes. Single ropes are the most common type of rope and are used for most types of climbing. Double ropes are used for more demanding climbs, where the risk of a fall is higher. Twin ropes are used for very long climbs, where the weight of the rope becomes a significant factor.\n\n## Slings\n\nSlings are short, woven straps used to connect the rope to the climber's harness or to an anchor point. Slings are typically made of nylon or polyester and come in a range of lengths and widths. They are used to create a secure connection between the rope and the anchor point, and to protect the rope from abrasion.\n\n## Cords\n\nCords are thin, lightweight ropes used for a variety of purposes, including creating anchors and connecting the climber to the rope. Cords are typically made of nylon or polyester and come in a range of diameters and lengths.\n\n# Rope connectors\n\nRope connectors are devices used to connect the rope to the climber's harness, to an anchor point, or to another rope.\n\n## Carabiners\n\nCarabiners are metal clips used to connect the rope to the climber's harness or to an anchor point. They come in a range of shapes and sizes, and are typically made of aluminum or steel. Carabiners are designed to be strong and reliable, and are a critical component of rock-climbing equipment.\n\n## Harnesses\n\nHarnesses are worn by the climber to provide a secure connection to the rope. Harnesses are typically made of nylon or polyester and come in a range of styles and sizes. They are designed to be comfortable and adjustable, and to distribute the force of a fall across the climber's body.\n\n## Lanyards\n\nLanyards are short straps used to connect the climber's harness to the rope or to an anchor point. Lanyards are typically made of nylon or polyester and come in a range of lengths and widths.\n\n### Personal anchor systems\n\nPersonal anchor systems (PAS) are portable anchors that can be used to create a secure connection to the rock face. PAS are typically made of nylon or polyester and come in a range of styles and sizes. They are designed to be lightweight and compact, and to provide a secure connection to the rock face.\n\n## Quickdraws\n\nQuickdraws are devices used to connect the rope to an anchor point. They consist of two carabiners connected by a sling or cord. Quickdraws are typically used in sport climbing, where the anchor points are pre-drilled and equipped with bolts.\n\n# Rope devices\n\nRope devices are used to control the rope, to protect the rope from abrasion, and to facilitate the climbing process.\n\n## Ascenders\n\nAscenders are devices used to climb the rope. They come in a range of styles and sizes, and are typically made of aluminum or steel. Ascenders are designed to be strong and reliable, and are used in a variety of climbing applications, including rescue and aid climbing.\n\n## Belay devices\n\nBelay devices are used to control the rope during climbing and descending. They come in a range of styles and sizes, and are typically made of aluminum or steel. Belay devices are designed to be strong and reliable, and are a critical component of rock-climbing equipment.\n\n## Descenders\n\nDescenders are devices used to control the rope during descending. They come in a range of styles and sizes, and are typically made of aluminum or steel. Descenders are designed to be strong and reliable, and are used in a variety of climbing applications, including rescue and aid climbing.\n\n## Self-locking devices\n\nSelf-locking devices are used to create a secure connection to the rope. They come in a range of styles and sizes, and are typically made of aluminum or steel. Self-locking devices are designed to be strong and reliable, and are used in a variety of climbing applications, including rescue and aid climbing.\n\n# Protection devices\n\nProtection devices are used to protect the climber from falls and to provide a secure connection to the rock face.\n\n## Temporary\n\nTemporary protection devices are used to create a secure connection to the rock face on a temporary basis. They come in a range of styles and sizes, and are typically made of nylon or polyester.\n\n### Active\n\nActive protection devices are used to create a secure connection to the rock face by actively engaging with the rock.

The protest began on January 18, 2023, and continued for several days, drawing widespread attention and support from across the country.\n\n# Background\n\nThe Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) is the governing body for wrestling in India, responsible for promoting and developing the sport. Brij Bhushan Singh, a BJP MP from Uttar Pradesh, has been the president of the WFI since 2011. In recent years, the WFI has faced several allegations of corruption, mismanagement, and misconduct, including sexual harassment of female wrestlers.\n\nIn December 2022, several female wrestlers, including Olympic medalist Sakshi Malik and World Championship medalist Vinesh Phogat, accused Singh of sexual harassment and corruption. The allegations sparked widespread outrage and calls for Singh's resignation.\n\n# Initial Investigation\n\nFollowing the allegations, the Union Sports Ministry launched an investigation into the matter. A committee was formed to look into the allegations and submit a report. However, the investigation was criticized for being slow and inadequate, leading to growing frustration among the wrestlers.\n\n# Protest Overview\n\n## FIR Registration and Supreme Court Intervention\n\nOn January 18, 2023, several wrestlers, including Sakshi Malik, Vinesh Phogat, and Bajrang Punia, gathered at the Jantar Mantar in New Delhi to protest against the WFI and Singh. The wrestlers demanded Singh's resignation and the dissolution of the WFI.\n\nThe same day, the wrestlers also filed a First Information Report (FIR) at the New Delhi Police Station, alleging sexual harassment and corruption against Singh. The FIR was registered under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, including section 354 (assault or use of force on a woman with intent to outrage her modesty).\n\nThe Supreme Court of India also took suo motu cognizance of the matter and issued a notice to the WFI and the Union Sports Ministry, seeking a response within a week.\n\n## Jantar Mantar Clash\n\nOn January 20, 2023, a clash broke out between the protesting wrestlers and the police at the Jantar Mantar. The wrestlers were trying to march towards the Parliament House, but were stopped by the police. The clash resulted in several injuries and arrests.\n\n## Formation of SIT and Questioning of Witnesses\n\nFollowing the clash, the Delhi Police formed a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to investigate the allegations against Singh. The SIT began questioning witnesses, including the wrestlers who had filed the FIR.\n\n## New Parliament House March and Detainment\n\nOn January 22, 2023, the wrestlers again attempted to march towards the Parliament House, but were detained by the police. The wrestlers were taken to a police station, where they were kept for several hours before being released.\n\n## Meeting with Sports Minister and Filing Chargesheet\n\nOn January 24, 2023, the wrestlers met with the Union Sports Minister, Anurag Thakur, to discuss their demands. The minister assured the wrestlers that the government would take action against Singh and the WFI.\n\nThe same day, the police filed a chargesheet against Singh, alleging sexual harassment and corruption.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nFollowing the filing of the chargesheet, Singh resigned as the president of the WFI. The WFI was also dissolved, and a new governing body was formed to oversee wrestling in India.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## Domestic\n\n### Criticism\n\nThe protest was widely criticized by the government and the WFI, who alleged that the wrestlers were trying to politicize the issue. The government also accused the wrestlers of trying to disrupt the Republic Day celebrations.\n\nHowever, the protest received widespread support from the public and the media, who praised the wrestlers for standing up against corruption and harassment.\n\n## International\n\n### United World Wrestling\n\nThe United World Wrestling (UWW), the international governing body for wrestling, issued a statement expressing concern over the allegations against Singh. The UWW also offered support to the Indian wrestlers and called for a thorough investigation.\n\n### International Olympic Committee\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) also issued a statement expressing concern over the allegations. The IOC called for a thorough investigation and offered support to the Indian wrestlers.\n\n### Parliamentarians\n\nSeveral parliamentarians, including opposition leaders, expressed support for the wrestlers and called for Singh's resignation.\n\n# Media Coverage\n\nThe protest received widespread media coverage, with several news channels and newspapers covering the story extensively. The media praised the wrestlers for standing up against corruption and harassment.\n\n# Impact\n\nThe protest had a significant impact on wrestling in India, leading to the resignation of Singh and the dissolution of the WFI. The protest also raised awareness about corruption and harassment in sports and led to calls for greater accountability and transparency.\n\n# Gallery\n\n[Insert images of the protest]\n\n# See Also\n\n* Wrestling Federation of India\n* Brij Bhushan Singh\n* Sakshi Malik\n* Vinesh Phogat\n* Bajrang Punia\n\n# External Links\n\n* [Insert links to news articles and official websites]", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Indian_wrestlers'_protest\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Initial investigation\n#Protest overview\n##FIR registration and Supreme court intervention\n##Jantar Mantar clash\n##Formation of SIT and questioning of witnesses\n##New Parliament House march and detainment\n##Meeting with Sports Minister and filing chargesheet\n#Aftermath\n#Reactions\n##Domestic\n###Criticism\n##International\n###United World Wrestling\n###International Olympic Committee\n###Parliamentarians\n#Media coverage\n#Impact\n#Gallery\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is characterized by a seizure that occurs in association with a fever, typically above 38°C (100.4°F). Febrile seizures are relatively common, affecting approximately 3-4% of children in this age group. In most cases, febrile seizures are not a cause for concern and do not indicate any underlying neurological disorder.\n\n# Signs and Symptoms\n\nFebrile seizures typically manifest as a sudden, generalized tonic-clonic seizure, which means that the child's body stiffens and then convulses. The seizure may last from a few seconds to several minutes, and in some cases, may be followed by a period of confusion or lethargy. During the seizure, the child may:\n\n* Stiffen and become rigid\n* Convulse or shake\n* Lose consciousness\n* Roll their eyes back\n* Foam at the mouth\n* Make unusual sounds\n\nAfter the seizure, the child may:\n\n* Be confused or disoriented\n* Be lethargic or sleepy\n* Experience a headache or fatigue\n* Have a fever\n\n## Types\n\nThere are two main types of febrile seizures:\n\n* Simple febrile seizure: This is the most common type, accounting for approximately 80-90% of cases. It is characterized by a single seizure that lasts less than 15 minutes and does not recur within a 24-hour period.\n* Complex febrile seizure: This type is less common, accounting for approximately 10-20% of cases. It is characterized by a seizure that lasts longer than 15 minutes, recurs within a 24-hour period, or is focal (i.e., affects only one part of the body).\n\n# Causes\n\nThe exact cause of febrile seizures is not fully understood, but it is thought to be related to the following factors:\n\n* Genetic predisposition: Children with a family history of febrile seizures are more likely to experience them.\n* Viral infections: Viral infections, such as roseola or influenza, can trigger febrile seizures.\n* Bacterial infections: Bacterial infections, such as urinary tract infections or pneumonia, can also trigger febrile seizures.\n* Immature brain development: Children's brains are still developing, and this may make them more susceptible to seizures.\n\n# Mechanism\n\nThe exact mechanism of febrile seizures is not fully understood, but it is thought to involve a combination of factors, including:\n\n* Abnormal electrical activity in the brain: This can be caused by the fever itself, or by the underlying infection.\n* Imbalance of neurotransmitters: Neurotransmitters, such as dopamine and serotonin, play a crucial role in regulating electrical activity in the brain. An imbalance of these neurotransmitters may contribute to the development of febrile seizures.\n* Inflammation: Inflammation in the brain may also play a role in the development of febrile seizures.\n\n# Diagnosis\n\nDiagnosing febrile seizures typically involves a combination of:\n\n* Medical history: The doctor will take a detailed medical history to rule out any underlying conditions that may be causing the seizure.\n* Physical examination: The doctor will perform a physical examination to check for any signs of infection or other underlying conditions.\n* Laboratory tests: Laboratory tests, such as blood tests or urine tests, may be ordered to check for any underlying infections or conditions.\n* Imaging tests: Imaging tests, such as CT or MRI scans, may be ordered to rule out any underlying structural abnormalities in the brain.\n\n# Prevention\n\nWhile it is not possible to completely prevent febrile seizures, there are some steps that can be taken to reduce the risk:\n\n* Keeping the child cool: Keeping the child cool can help to reduce the risk of febrile seizures.\n* Using anti-pyretic medications: Anti-pyretic medications, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, can help to reduce the child's fever and reduce the risk of febrile seizures.\n* Practicing good hygiene: Practicing good hygiene, such as frequent handwashing, can help to reduce the risk of infections that can trigger febrile seizures.\n\n# Treatment\n\nTreatment for febrile seizures typically involves:\n\n* First aid: The first step in treating a febrile seizure is to ensure the child's safety. This involves turning the child onto their side, loosening any tight clothing, and keeping the child cool.\n* Anti-pyretic medications: Anti-pyretic medications, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, can help to reduce the child's fever and reduce the risk of further seizures.\n* Hospitalization: In some cases, the child may need to be hospitalized for observation or further treatment.\n\n# Prognosis\n\nThe prognosis for children who experience febrile seizures is generally good. In most cases, febrile seizures do not indicate any underlying neurological disorder, and the child will not experience any long-term effects. However, in some cases, febrile seizures can increase the risk of:\n\n* Recurrent febrile seizures: Children who experience febrile seizures are at increased risk of experiencing further seizures.\n* Epilepsy: Children who experience febrile seizures are at increased risk of developing epilepsy.\n* Developmental delays: Children who experience febrile seizures may be at increased risk of developmental delays.\n\n# Epidemiology\n\nFebrile seizures are relatively common, affecting approximately 3-4% of children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years. The incidence of febrile seizures varies depending on the population being studied, but it is generally higher in:\n\n* Children under the age of 2 years\n* Children with a family history of febrile seizures\n* Children who have experienced previous febrile seizures\n\n# References", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Febrile_seizure\" following this outline:\n\n#Signs and symptoms\n##Types\n#Causes\n#Mechanism\n#Diagnosis\n#Prevention\n#Treatment\n#Prognosis\n#Epidemiology\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The party was founded in 1990 and has been active in California politics for over three decades. The Green Party of California is committed to promoting grassroots democracy, social justice, and environmental sustainability.\n\n# History\n\nThe Green Party of California has a rich history, dating back to the early 1990s. The party was founded by a group of activists who were dissatisfied with the two-party system and sought to create a more inclusive and progressive alternative.\n\n## Qualifying for elections\n\nTo qualify for elections in California, a party must register with the Secretary of State's office and meet certain requirements. The Green Party of California met these requirements in 1991 and has been qualified to participate in state elections ever since.\n\n## Electoral milestones\n\nThe Green Party of California has achieved several electoral milestones over the years. In 1992, the party's presidential candidate, Bill Clinton, received over 1 million votes in California. In 2000, the party's gubernatorial candidate, Peter Camejo, received over 5% of the vote, qualifying the party for major party status. In 2010, the party's candidate for Lieutenant Governor, Laura Wells, received over 400,000 votes.\n\n## Top-two primaries\n\nIn 2010, California voters passed Proposition 14, which established a top-two primary system. Under this system, the top two candidates in a primary election, regardless of party affiliation, advance to the general election. The Green Party of California has been critical of this system, arguing that it limits voter choice and favors the two major parties.\n\n# Platform\n\nThe Green Party of California's platform is based on the Ten Key Values of the Green Party of the United States. These values include grassroots democracy, social justice, ecological wisdom, and non-violence.

The referendums, widely condemned by the international community, aimed to legitimize Russia's control over these regions. The votes took place in the midst of the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, which began in February 2022. This article provides an overview of the background, organization, and conduct of the referendums, as well as the reactions and possible consequences of these events.\n\n#Background\n\nFollowing the onset of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russian forces gained control over significant territories in eastern and southern Ukraine. The occupied regions, including parts of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia Oblasts, were subject to varying degrees of Russian military and administrative control. In the lead-up to the referendums, Russian authorities and local collaborators worked to establish a semblance of governance in these areas, including the creation of proxy governments and law enforcement agencies.\n\n#Organization\n\nThe referendums were organized by the Russian-installed authorities in the occupied territories, with the support of the Russian government. The votes were scheduled to take place from September 23 to 27, 2022. The organization and conduct of the referendums were widely criticized for lacking transparency, independence, and international oversight.\n\n##Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts\n\n###Questions\n\nThe referendums in Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts asked voters whether they supported the annexation of these territories by Russia. The question on the ballot reads: \"Do you support the entry of the Donetsk People's Republic into the Russian Federation as a constituent entity of the Russian Federation?\"\n\n###Results\n\nAccording to the results announced by the Russian-installed authorities, an overwhelming majority of voters in both Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts supported annexation. In Donetsk Oblast, the announced result was 99.23% in favor of annexation, while in Luhansk Oblast, the result was 98.42% in favor.\n\n##Kherson Oblast\n\n###Question\n\nThe referendum in Kherson Oblast asked voters whether they supported the annexation of the region by Russia. The question on the ballot reads: \"Do you support the entry of the Kherson region into the Russian Federation as a constituent entity of the Russian Federation?\"\n\n###Result\n\nAccording to the results announced by the Russian-installed authorities, 87.05% of voters in Kherson Oblast supported annexation.\n\n##Zaporizhzhia Oblast\n\n###Question\n\nThe referendum in Zaporizhzhia Oblast asked voters whether they supported the annexation of the region by Russia. The question on the ballot reads: \"Do you support the entry of the Zaporizhzhia region into the Russian Federation as a constituent entity of the Russian Federation?\"\n\n###Result\n\nAccording to the results announced by the Russian-installed authorities, 93.11% of voters in Zaporizhzhia Oblast supported annexation.\n\n#Other planned locations\n\nIn addition to the referendums held in Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia Oblasts, Russian-installed authorities had planned to hold votes in other occupied territories, including Mykolaiv and Kharkiv Oblasts. However, these plans were put on hold due to ongoing military operations in these areas.\n\n##Mykolaiv Oblast\n\nRussian-installed authorities had planned to hold a referendum in Mykolaiv Oblast, which is partially occupied by Russian forces. However, the vote was postponed due to the ongoing military situation in the region.\n\n##Kharkiv Oblast\n\nRussian-installed authorities had also planned to hold a referendum in Kharkiv Oblast, which is partially occupied by Russian forces. However, the vote was postponed due to the ongoing military situation in the region.\n\n#Opinion polls\n\nOpinion polls conducted in the lead-up to the referendums suggested that a significant portion of the population in the occupied territories opposed annexation by Russia. However, these polls were not conducted under conditions of free and fair expression, and their results should be treated with caution.\n\n#Opinions on the goals of holding referendums\n\nThe goals of holding the referendums were widely seen as an attempt by Russia to legitimize its control over the occupied territories. The votes were also seen as a way for Russia to consolidate its gains and create a pretext for further military action in Ukraine.\n\n#Conduct\n\nThe conduct of the referendums was widely criticized for lacking transparency, independence, and international oversight. The votes were held under conditions of military occupation, and many voters were coerced or intimidated into participating.\n\n##First day\n\nThe first day of voting saw reports of widespread irregularities, including the use of armed men to intimidate voters and the distribution of pre-marked ballots.\n\n##Second day\n\nThe second day of voting saw a significant increase in turnout, with many voters reportedly being brought to polling stations by Russian-installed authorities.\n\n##Third day\n\nThe third day of voting saw reports of continued irregularities, including the use of fake polling stations and the distribution of fake ballots.\n\n##Fourth day\n\nThe fourth day of voting saw a significant decrease in turnout, with many voters reportedly staying away from the polls due to concerns about safety and the legitimacy of the vote.\n\n##Fifth day\n\nThe final day of voting saw reports of widespread irregularities, including the use of armed men to intimidate voters and the destruction of ballots.\n\n#Reactions\n\nThe reactions to the referendums were widely negative, with many countries and international organizations condemning the votes as illegitimate and a violation of international law.\n\n##Ukraine\n\nThe Ukrainian government condemned the referendums as a \"sham\" and a \"violation of international law.\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that the votes would not be recognized by Ukraine or the international community.\n\n##Russia\n\nThe Russian government hailed the referendums as a \"success\" and a \"legitimate expression of the will of the people.\" Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that the votes would be recognized by Russia and that the annexed territories would be defended by Russian forces.\n\n##International organisations\n\nThe United Nations, the European Union, and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe all condemned the referendums as illegitimate and a violation of international law.\n\n##Countries\n\nMany countries, including the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, condemned the referendums as illegitimate and a violation of international law.\n\n##Human rights organizations\n\nHuman rights organizations, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, condemned the referendums as a \"sham\" and a \"violation of human rights.\"\n\n##Other\n\nOther international organizations and civil society groups also condemned the referendums as illegitimate and a violation of international law.\n\n#Possible consequences\n\nThe possible consequences of the referendums include further military action in Ukraine, increased sanctions against Russia, and a worsening of the humanitarian situation in the occupied territories.\n\n#Aftermath\n\nThe aftermath of the referendums saw a significant escalation of the conflict in Ukraine, with Russia launching a series of missile strikes against Ukrainian cities. The international community continued to condemn the referendums and the annexation of the occupied territories, and many countries imposed further sanctions against Russia.\n\n#See also\n\n##Likewise referendums\n\n* 2014 Crimean status referendum\n* 2014 Donbas status referendums\n\n##Irredentism\n\n* Russian irredentism\n* Ukrainian irredentism\n\n##Geopolitical aspects\n\n* Russia–Ukraine relations\n* Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation\n\n#References\n\n#External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_annexation_referendums_in_Russian-occupied_Ukraine\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Organization\n#Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts\n##Questions\n##Results\n#Kherson Oblast\n##Question\n##Result\n#Zaporizhzhia Oblast\n##Question\n##Result\n#Other planned locations\n##Mykolaiv Oblast\n##Kharkiv Oblast\n#Opinion polls\n#Opinions on the goals of holding referendums\n#Conduct\n##First day\n##Second day\n##Third day\n##Fourth day\n##Fifth day\n#Reactions\n##Ukraine\n##Russia\n##International organisations\n##Countries\n##Human rights organizations\n##Other\n#Possible consequences\n#Aftermath\n#See also\n##Likewise referendums\n##Irredentism\n##Geopolitical aspects\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He is often referred to as the \"Father of the Constitution\" for his role in drafting and promoting the United States Constitution and the Bill of Rights.\n\n#Early life and education\n\nJames Madison was born on March 16, 1751, in Port Conway, Virginia, to Colonel James Madison Sr. and Eleanor Rose Conway Madison. He was the oldest of 12 children, and his family was considered to be of moderate means. Madison's father was a planter and a justice of the peace, and his mother was a homemaker.\n\nMadison received his early education at home, where he was taught by his mother and a private tutor. In 1769, he attended the Innes Creek School, a boarding school in Virginia. Two years later, he enrolled at the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University), where he studied under the guidance of President John Witherspoon. Madison graduated in 1771, and he remained at the college for an additional year to study Hebrew and philosophy.\n\n#American Revolution and Articles of Confederation\n\nAfter completing his education, Madison returned to Virginia and became involved in the American Revolution. In 1775, he was appointed as a colonel in the Orange County militia, and he played a key role in organizing the Virginia militia. Madison also served as a delegate to the Virginia House of Delegates from 1776 to 1779.\n\nIn 1780, Madison was appointed as a delegate to the Continental Congress, where he played a key role in shaping the country's foreign policy. He served on the committee that drafted the Treaty of Paris, which ended the American Revolutionary War.\n\nAfter the war, Madison became a key figure in the movement to revise the Articles of Confederation. He believed that the Articles were inadequate and that a stronger federal government was needed to ensure the country's stability and prosperity. In 1786, Madison attended the Annapolis Convention, where he met with other leaders to discuss the need for a constitutional convention.\n\n#Ratification of the Constitution\n\nIn 1787, Madison attended the Philadelphia Convention, where the United States Constitution was drafted. He played a key role in shaping the document, and he is often referred to as the \"Father of the Constitution.\" Madison believed that a strong federal government was necessary to ensure the country's stability and prosperity, but he also believed in the importance of individual rights and liberties.\n\nAfter the Constitution was drafted, Madison played a key role in its ratification. He wrote several essays in support of the document, including Federalist 10, which is still widely read today. Madison also served as a delegate to the Virginia Ratifying Convention, where he argued in favor of the Constitution's adoption.\n\n#Congressman and party leader (1789–1801)\n\n##Election to Congress\n\nIn 1789, Madison was elected to the United States House of Representatives, where he served until 1797. He was a key figure in the early Congress, and he played a leading role in shaping the country's legislative agenda.\n\n##Bill of Rights\n\nIn 1789, Madison introduced a bill to amend the Constitution, which became known as the Bill of Rights. The bill consisted of 10 amendments that guaranteed individual rights and liberties, including freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right to a fair trial. Madison's bill was approved by Congress in 1789, and it was ratified by the states in 1791.\n\n##Founding the Democratic–Republican Party\n\nIn the 1790s, Madison became increasingly disillusioned with the Federalist Party, which he believed was too conservative and too supportive of a strong central government. In 1792, he joined with Thomas Jefferson to form the Democratic-Republican Party, which was opposed to the Federalist Party.\n\n##Marriage and family\n\nIn 1794, Madison married Dolley Payne Todd, a widow with a young son. The couple had no children together, but they raised Dolley's son from her previous marriage.\n\n##Adams presidency\n\nIn 1797, Madison retired from Congress and returned to Virginia. He remained active in politics, however, and he served as a key advisor to Thomas Jefferson during his presidency. Madison also opposed the Alien and Sedition Acts, which were passed during the presidency of John Adams.\n\n#Secretary of State (1801–1809)\n\nIn 1801, Madison was appointed as Secretary of State by Thomas Jefferson. He served in this position until 1809, when he was elected as President of the United States.\n\n##1808 presidential election\n\nIn 1808, Madison was elected as President of the United States, defeating Charles Pinckney in the general election. He was the fourth President of the United States, and he served two terms in office.\n\n#Presidency (1809–1817)\n\n##Inauguration and cabinet\n\nMadison was inaugurated as President on March 4, 1809. He appointed a cabinet that included James Monroe as Secretary of State and William Eustis as Secretary of War.\n\n##War of 1812\n\n###Prelude to war\n\nIn 1812, Madison asked Congress to declare war on Great Britain, which had been impressing American sailors and interfering with American trade. The war was also motivated by American expansionism and a desire to assert American sovereignty.\n\n###Military actions\n\nThe War of 1812 was fought on several fronts, including the Atlantic Ocean, the Great Lakes, and the Mississippi River. American forces suffered several setbacks, including the burning of Washington, D.C. by British troops. However, the war also saw several American victories, including the Battle of Lake Erie and the Battle of New Orleans.\n\n##Postwar period and decline of the Federalist opposition\n\nAfter the War of 1812, Madison's popularity increased, and the Federalist Party declined. Madison also oversaw the signing of the Treaty of Ghent, which ended the war.\n\n##Native American policy\n\nMadison's Native American policy was marked by conflict and violence. He oversaw the forced relocation of several Native American tribes, including the Creek Nation.\n\n##Election of 1816\n\nIn 1816, Madison was re-elected as President, defeating Rufus King in the general election. He served a second term in office, which was marked by a period of economic growth and prosperity.\n\n#Post-presidency (1817–1836)\n\nAfter leaving office, Madison returned to Montpelier, his estate in Virginia. He remained active in politics, however, and he served as a delegate to the Virginia Constitutional Convention in 1829.\n\n##Death\n\nMadison died on June 28, 1836, at the age of 85. He was buried on the grounds of Montpelier, where his wife Dolley had been buried several years earlier.\n\n#Political and religious views\n\n##Federalism\n\nMadison was a strong supporter of federalism, which he believed was necessary to ensure the country's stability and prosperity. He also believed in the importance of individual rights and liberties, and he played a key role in drafting the Bill of Rights.\n\n##Religion\n\nMadison was an Episcopalian, and he believed in the importance of religious freedom. He also believed in the separation of church and state, and he opposed the establishment of a national church.\n\n#Slavery\n\nMadison was a slaveowner, and he believed that slavery was a necessary institution in the South. However, he also believed that slavery was morally wrong, and he freed several of his slaves in his will.\n\n#Legacy\n\nMadison's legacy is complex and multifaceted. He is remembered as the \"Father of the Constitution\" and as a strong supporter of individual rights and liberties. He is also remembered as a skilled politician and diplomat who played a key role in shaping the country's early history.\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is a general overview of James Madison's life and legacy.

The area has gained notoriety in recent years due to the large population of homeless individuals and those struggling with addiction who have congregated there. The situation at Mass. and Cass has been described as a humanitarian crisis, with concerns about public health, safety, and welfare.\n\nAftermath of Long Island closure\n---------------------------------\n\n### Closure of Long Island services\n\nIn 2014, the City of Boston closed the Long Island Shelter and Recovery Services, which provided services to homeless individuals struggling with addiction. The closure was due to the deterioration of the bridge connecting Long Island to the mainland, which made it impossible to transport people and supplies to the island. The closure led to a displacement of services and individuals, who were forced to find alternative locations to access support and shelter.\n\n### Shelter openings at Mass. and Cass\n\nFollowing the closure of Long Island services, the City of Boston opened new shelters in the area surrounding Mass. and Cass. These shelters, including the Southampton Street Shelter and the Woods Mullen Shelter, provided emergency housing and support services to individuals in need. However, the shelters quickly became overwhelmed, and the area surrounding Mass. and Cass became a magnet for homeless individuals and those struggling with addiction.\n\nBusiness concerns\n-----------------\n\nThe concentration of homeless individuals and those struggling with addiction in the Mass. and Cass area has raised concerns among local business owners. Many have reported increased incidents of shoplifting, vandalism, and loitering, which have negatively impacted their businesses. Some have also expressed concerns about the safety of their employees and customers, citing instances of harassment and intimidation. In response, the City of Boston has increased police presence in the area and implemented measures to address the concerns of local business owners.\n\nPopulation\n------------\n\nThe population of homeless individuals and those struggling with addiction in the Mass. and Cass area is estimated to be in the hundreds. Many of these individuals are struggling with addiction, mental health issues, or a combination of both. The area has become a hub for services, including food, shelter, and medical care, which has attracted individuals from across the region. However, the concentration of services has also created challenges, including overcrowding, sanitation issues, and increased crime.\n\nEfforts to clear out the encampment\n-----------------------------------\n\n### Operation Clean Sweep\n\nIn 2020, the City of Boston launched Operation Clean Sweep, a initiative aimed at clearing out the encampment in the Mass. and Cass area. The operation involved a coordinated effort between city agencies, including the Boston Police Department, the Department of Public Works, and the Boston Public Health Commission. The goal of the operation was to provide services and support to individuals in need, while also addressing concerns about public safety and health.\n\n### Sheriff's proposal to force treatment of individuals\n\nIn 2020, Suffolk County Sheriff Steven Tompkins proposed a plan to force treatment of individuals struggling with addiction in the Mass. and Cass area. The plan would have involved involuntary commitment to treatment facilities, which sparked controversy among advocates and community members. The proposal was ultimately rejected, but it highlighted the complexity and challenges of addressing the addiction crisis in the area.\n\n### Executive order to clear encampment\n\nIn 2021, Boston Mayor Kim Janey issued an executive order aimed at clearing out the encampment in the Mass. and Cass area. The order directed city agencies to provide services and support to individuals in need, while also addressing concerns about public safety and health. The order also authorized the use of city resources to address the crisis, including increased police presence and sanitation services.\n\n### Sweep and diversion to low-threshold shelters\n\nIn 2021, the City of Boston conducted a sweep of the Mass. and Cass area, diverting individuals to low-threshold shelters. The shelters, which provide basic services and support, were seen as a more humane alternative to traditional shelters. The sweep was part of a larger effort to address the homelessness crisis in the area, and to provide individuals with access to support and services.\n\nCollection of syringes\n----------------------\n\nThe Mass. and Cass area has seen a significant increase in discarded syringes, which has raised concerns about public health and safety. The City of Boston has implemented measures to address the issue, including increased sanitation services and the distribution of naloxone, a medication that can reverse opioid overdoses. However, the problem persists, and community members have called for more action to address the issue.\n\nRise in violence\n-----------------\n\nThe Mass. and Cass area has seen a rise in violence in recent years, including incidents of assault, robbery, and homicide. The violence has been attributed to a combination of factors, including addiction, mental health issues, and poverty. Community members have called for increased police presence and support services to address the issue.\n\nPolice presence\n----------------\n\n### Overtime spending\n\nThe Boston Police Department has spent millions of dollars in overtime pay to officers working in the Mass. and Cass area. The overtime pay has been criticized by some, who argue that it is a Band-Aid solution to a more complex problem. However, others have argued that the increased police presence is necessary to address concerns about public safety.\n\n### Lack of intervention in violence\n\nDespite the increased police presence in the Mass. and Cass area, there have been concerns about the lack of intervention in violent incidents. Some have argued that officers are not doing enough to prevent violence, or to respond to incidents in a timely manner. The issue has been the subject of controversy, with some calling for increased training and support for officers working in the area.\n\n### Command center\n\nIn 2021, the Boston Police Department established a command center in the Mass. and Cass area, aimed at coordinating responses to incidents and addressing concerns about public safety. The command center has been seen as a positive step, providing a centralized location for officers to respond to incidents and coordinate with other agencies. However, the effectiveness of the command center remains to be seen, and community members continue to call for more action to address the crisis in the area.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Mass._and_Cass\" following this outline:\n\n#Aftermath of Long Island closure\n##Closure of Long Island services\n##Shelter openings at Mass. and Cass\n#Business concerns\n#Population\n#Efforts to clear out the encampment\n##Operation Clean Sweep\n##Sheriff's proposal to force treatment of individuals\n##Executive order to clear encampment\n##Sweep and diversion to low-threshold shelters\n#Collection of syringes\n#Rise in violence\n#Police presence\n##Overtime spending\n##Lack of intervention in violence\n##Command center\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

As a key figure in the Second Viennese School, Webern's compositions are characterized by their use of atonality, serialism, and a unique blend of lyricism and rigor. This article provides an overview of Webern's life, music, and legacy, exploring his development as a composer, his relationships with contemporaries, and the impact of his work on the musical world.\n\n# Biography\n\n## 1883–1908: Upbringing between late Imperial Vienna and countryside\n\n### Bucolic Heimat\n\nWebern was born on December 3, 1883, in Vienna, Austria-Hungary, to a musical family. His father, Carl von Webern, was a mining official, and the family moved frequently during Webern's childhood, spending time in various rural locations, including Graz, Klagenfurt, and Sankt Polten. These idyllic surroundings, which Webern would later refer to as his \"Heimat\" (homeland), had a profound impact on his early life and musical development.\n\n### University\n\nIn 1902, Webern began studying musicology at the University of Vienna, where he was introduced to the works of Richard Wagner, Franz Schubert, and other prominent composers. During this period, he also developed a strong interest in the music of Arnold Schoenberg, who would later become his mentor and friend.\n\n### Schoenberg and his circle\n\nIn 1904, Webern met Schoenberg, who was then teaching at the Vienna Conservatory. Schoenberg's innovative compositions and pedagogical approach had a profound impact on Webern, who soon became a member of Schoenberg's inner circle. This group, which included other notable composers such as Alban Berg and Erwin Stein, would play a crucial role in shaping Webern's musical style and artistic vision.\n\n## 1908–1918: Early adulthood in Austria-Hungary and German Empire\n\n### Marriage\n\nIn 1911, Webern married Wilhelmine Mörtl, a woman from a humble background. The marriage was marked by financial struggles, but it also brought Webern a sense of stability and domestic happiness.\n\n### Early conducting career\n\nWebern's conducting career began in 1907, when he took up a position at the Theater in Bad Ischl. Over the next few years, he worked as a conductor in various opera houses and concert halls, developing his skills and building a reputation as a talented and dedicated musician.\n\n### Psychotherapy\n\nIn 1912, Webern underwent a period of psychotherapy with Dr. Alfred Adler, a prominent Viennese psychologist. This experience had a significant impact on Webern's personal life and artistic development, helping him to confront his inner demons and develop a greater sense of self-awareness.\n\n### \"Old song\" of \"lost paradise\"\n\nDuring this period, Webern became increasingly fascinated with the idea of a \"lost paradise,\" a mythical realm that represented a state of innocence and purity. This concept would become a recurring theme in his music, as he sought to evoke a sense of longing and nostalgia for a bygone era.\n\n### World War I\n\nIn 1914, Webern was drafted into the Austro-Hungarian army, where he served as a lieutenant in the artillery. The experience of war had a profound impact on Webern, who was deeply affected by the violence and destruction that surrounded him.\n\n### Austrian defeat and socioeconomic strain\n\nThe defeat of Austria-Hungary in 1918 marked the beginning of a period of socioeconomic strain, as the country struggled to rebuild and redefine itself. Webern, like many of his contemporaries, was forced to navigate this uncertain landscape, seeking ways to maintain his artistic integrity in the face of economic hardship.\n\n## 1918–1933: Rise in Rotes Wien (Interwar Vienna)\n\n### Society for Private Musical Performances\n\nIn 1918, Webern became a founding member of the Society for Private Musical Performances, a organization dedicated to promoting contemporary music. This group, which included other notable composers and musicians, played a crucial role in shaping Vienna's musical landscape during the interwar period.\n\n### Mature conducting career\n\nDuring the 1920s, Webern's conducting career flourished, as he took on positions at various opera houses and concert halls. His performances were marked by a sense of intensity and passion, as he sought to bring his own unique interpretation to the works of other composers.\n\n### Relative success in a destabilizing society\n\nDespite the economic and social turmoil that surrounded him, Webern experienced a period of relative success during the 1920s. His music was performed regularly, and he became a respected figure in Vienna's musical community.\n\n## 1933–1938: Perseverance in Schwarzes Wien (Austrofascist Vienna)\n\n### Marginalization at home\n\nIn 1933, Webern's situation became increasingly difficult, as the Austrofascist government began to marginalize him and other modernist composers. His music was seen as decadent and subversive, and he was forced to rely on the support of a small circle of friends and admirers.\n\n### Besieged milieu and political confusion\n\nVienna during this period was a city in turmoil, as the Austrofascist government sought to impose its own brand of authoritarianism. Webern, like many of his contemporaries, was forced to navigate this treacherous landscape, seeking ways to maintain his artistic integrity in the face of political repression.\n\n### Visiting conducting career\n\nIn an effort to escape the difficulties of life in Vienna, Webern began to accept visiting conducting engagements in other cities. These performances helped to maintain his reputation as a conductor and provided a much-needed source of income.\n\n## 1938–1939: Inner emigration in Nazi Germany\n\n### Anschluss\n\nIn 1938, Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany, marking the beginning of a period of intense repression and terror. Webern, like many of his contemporaries, was forced to choose between emigration and inner emigration, a state of psychological and artistic withdrawal.\n\n### Kristallnacht and recoil\n\nThe events of Kristallnacht, a wave of violent anti-Semitic attacks that swept through Germany and Austria, had a profound impact on Webern. He became increasingly withdrawn, seeking solace in his music and the natural world.\n\n## 1939–1945: Hope and disillusionment during World War II\n\n### Swiss and Reich prospects\n\nIn 1939, Webern began to make plans for emigration, seeking a safe haven in Switzerland or the United States. However, these plans were ultimately thwarted, as he became increasingly disillusioned with the prospect of leaving his homeland.\n\n### Wartime hopes and reality\n\nAs the war dragged on, Webern's hopes for a better future began to fade. He became increasingly isolated, seeking solace in his music and the natural world.\n\n### Refuge and death in Mittersill\n\nIn 1945, Webern moved to Mittersill, a small town in the Austrian Alps, where he hoped to find refuge and safety. However, on September 15, 1945, he was accidentally shot and killed by an American soldier, marking the end of a life marked by tragedy and hardship.\n\n# Music\n\n## 1899–1908: Formative juvenilia and emergence from study\n\nWebern's early music was marked by a sense of romanticism and lyricism, as he sought to evoke the natural world and the human experience.

These works were marked by a sense of intensity and passion, as he sought to evoke the human experience.\n\n## 1924–1945: Formal coherence and expansion\n\nIn the 1920s, Webern began to develop a more formal approach to composition, marked by the use of serialism and twelve-tone technique. This period saw the composition of a range of innovative works, including his Symphony and String Quartet.\n\n## Arrangements and orchestrations\n\nThroughout his career, Webern was also active as an arranger and orchestrator, working on a range of projects for other composers. These works showcased his ability to reimagine and reinterpret existing music.\n\n# Reception, influence, and legacy\n\n## Performance practice\n\nWebern's music has been marked by a range of performance practices, from the intense and passionate to the cool and detached.
