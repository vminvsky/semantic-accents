Nestled in the heart of the Himalayas, the Aryan Valley is a fertile and picturesque region that has been home to various communities, including the Brokpas, for centuries.\n\n#Geography and economy\n\nThe Aryan Valley is situated in the eastern part of Ladakh, near the border with Tibet. The valley is surrounded by towering mountains, including the Karakoram range, and is drained by the Doda River. The region's geography is characterized by vast plains, rolling hills, and scenic valleys, making it an ideal location for agriculture and animal husbandry. The valley's economy is primarily based on subsistence farming, with crops such as barley, wheat, and potatoes being the mainstay of the local population. Animal husbandry is also a significant contributor to the local economy, with yak, sheep, and goats being the primary livestock.\n\nThe region's harsh climate and limited infrastructure make it challenging for the local population to access markets and other essential services. However, in recent years, the Indian government has initiated various development projects aimed at improving the region's infrastructure and promoting economic growth. These initiatives include the construction of roads, bridges, and other critical infrastructure, as well as programs aimed at promoting tourism and supporting local entrepreneurship.\n\n#History\n\nThe Aryan Valley has a rich and complex history that spans thousands of years. The region has been home to various communities, including the Brokpas, who have a distinct culture and language that is unique to the region.\n\n##Brokpas\n\nThe Brokpas are an indigenous community that has lived in the Aryan Valley for centuries. They are believed to be descended from the ancient Aryan people who migrated to the region from Central Asia. The Brokpas have a distinct culture and language that is unique to the region, and they have maintained their traditions and customs despite the influence of external factors.\n\nThe Brokpas are primarily farmers and herders, and they have developed a unique system of agriculture and animal husbandry that is adapted to the region's harsh climate. They are also skilled craftsmen, and they produce a range of traditional products, including textiles, metalwork, and woodcarvings.\n\n##Aryan association and neologism\n\nIn recent years, the term \"Aryan\" has been associated with the region due to the presence of the Brokpas, who are believed to be descended from the ancient Aryan people. However, this association is a neologism, and it is not supported by historical or scientific evidence.\n\nThe term \"Aryan\" was first used by the ancient Greeks to describe the people of Central Asia, and it was later adopted by the Nazis to describe the supposed racial superiority of the German people. However, this usage is widely recognized as a misnomer, and it is not supported by scientific evidence.\n\nIn the context of the Aryan Valley, the term \"Aryan\" is used to describe the region's cultural and linguistic heritage, rather than any supposed racial or ethnic identity. The Brokpas are a unique and distinct community that has a rich cultural heritage, and they are an important part of the region's history and identity.\n\n#See also\n\n* Ladakh\n* Jammu and Kashmir\n* Himalayas\n* Karakoram range\n* Brokpas\n* Aryan people\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is based on a neutral, encyclopedic tone and does not include any citations or references.\n\n#References\n\nNone\n\n#Bibliography\n\nNone\n\n#External links\n\nNone", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Aryan_Valley\" following this outline:\n\n#Geography and economy\n#History\n##Brokpas\n##Aryan association and neologism\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This phenomenon has occurred in various countries throughout history, often as a result of revolution, civil war, or regime change. In this article, we will explore the concept of an embassy without a government and examine specific cases in Russia, Spain, Poland, and Afghanistan.\n\n# History\n\n## Russia (1917–1925)\n\nThe Russian Revolution of 1917 led to the overthrow of the Romanov dynasty and the establishment of the world's first socialist state. However, the subsequent Russian Civil War (1917-1922) and the eventual rise of the Soviet Union resulted in a period of diplomatic uncertainty.\n\n### Diplomatic missions after 1917\n\nFollowing the revolution, many countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, maintained diplomatic relations with the Russian Provisional Government. However, after the Bolsheviks seized power in October 1917, these governments faced a dilemma. While some countries, such as the United Kingdom, recognized the Soviet government, others, like the United States, refused to do so.\n\nAs a result, many diplomatic missions in Russia continued to operate, but without formal recognition from the host government. This led to a situation where embassies and consulates functioned as de facto missions, often with limited authority and no official status.\n\n### Dissolution of the Soviet Union\n\nThe Soviet Union's dissolution in 1991 marked the end of the Cold War and led to a significant shift in international relations. However, the legacy of the Soviet era continued to influence diplomatic practices, particularly in countries with complex histories of government change.\n\n## Spain (1939–1977)\n\nThe Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) resulted in the establishment of a fascist dictatorship under General Francisco Franco. The war's end marked the beginning of a period of diplomatic isolation for Spain, which lasted until Franco's death in 1975.\n\n### Diplomatic missions after 1939\n\nFollowing the civil war, many countries, including the United Kingdom and the United States, maintained diplomatic relations with the Spanish government. However, the fascist nature of the regime led to widespread international criticism, and many countries, such as France, broke off relations.\n\nAs a result, some diplomatic missions in Spain operated without formal recognition from the host government or with limited authority. This led to a situation where embassies and consulates functioned as de facto missions, often with limited influence and no official status.\n\n## Poland (1939–1990)\n\nThe German and Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939 marked the beginning of World War II. The subsequent occupation and division of Poland led to a period of diplomatic uncertainty, which lasted until the fall of communism in 1989.\n\n### Diplomatic missions after 1939\n\nFollowing the invasion, many countries, including the United Kingdom and the United States, maintained diplomatic relations with the Polish government-in-exile. However, the Soviet-backed Polish People's Republic, established in 1945, was recognized by many countries, including the Soviet Union and its Eastern European allies.\n\nAs a result, some diplomatic missions in Poland operated without formal recognition from the host government or with limited authority. This led to a situation where embassies and consulates functioned as de facto missions, often with limited influence and no official status.\n\n## Afghanistan (2021–present)\n\nThe Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan in August 2021 marked the end of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the establishment of an Islamic Emirate. However, the new government has not been recognized by most countries, leading to a period of diplomatic uncertainty.\n\n### Diplomatic missions after 2021\n\nFollowing the Taliban's takeover, many countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada, evacuated their diplomatic staff and suspended operations. However, some countries, such as China, Russia, and Pakistan, have maintained diplomatic relations with the new government.\n\nAs a result, some diplomatic missions in Afghanistan operate without formal recognition from the host government or with limited authority. This has led to a situation where embassies and consulates function as de facto missions, often with limited influence and no official status.\n\n# See also\n\n* Diplomatic recognition\n* De facto government\n* Government in exile\n* International relations\n\n# Notes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Embassy_without_a_government\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Russia (1917–1925)\n###Diplomatic missions after 1917\n###Dissolution of the Soviet Union\n##Spain (1939–1977)\n###Diplomatic missions after 1939\n##Poland (1939–1990)\n###Diplomatic missions after 1939\n##Afghanistan (2021–present)\n###Diplomatic missions after 2021\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The company was headquartered in the Bahamas and quickly gained popularity as a platform for trading cryptocurrency derivatives, including options, futures, and perpetual swaps. FTX also operated a separate entity, FTX.US, which catered to the US market.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\nFTX was founded in April 2019 by Sam Bankman-Fried, a well-known trader and entrepreneur in the cryptocurrency space. Bankman-Fried had previously founded Alameda Research, a quantitative trading firm that specialized in cryptocurrency trading. FTX was initially incubated within Alameda Research before spinning off as a separate entity.\n\nIn 2020, FTX raised $8 million in funding from investors, including Binance, a prominent cryptocurrency exchange. This investment helped FTX expand its operations and improve its infrastructure. In 2021, FTX raised an additional $900 million in funding, valuing the company at $18 billion.\n\nFTX quickly gained popularity as a platform for trading cryptocurrency derivatives, known for its innovative products and user-friendly interface. The company also became known for its high-profile sponsorships and partnerships, including a deal with the Miami Heat to rename their arena to FTX Arena.\n\nNovember 2022 Crisis and Bankruptcy\n-----------------------------------\n\n### Background: FTX and Alameda, Binance, and CoinDesk report\n\nIn the months leading up to the crisis, FTX had faced increasing scrutiny over its business practices and relationships with other companies. In November 2022, a report by CoinDesk revealed that Alameda Research, the trading firm founded by Sam Bankman-Fried, held a significant portion of its balance sheet in FTX's native token, FTT.\n\nThis revelation raised concerns about the close relationship between FTX and Alameda Research, as well as the potential risks to FTX's balance sheet. Binance, a major cryptocurrency exchange and investor in FTX, also began to express concerns about FTX's financial health.\n\n### Crisis begins: Binance FTT sale, sell-off, and withdrawn rescue bid\n\nOn November 6, 2022, Binance announced that it would be selling its entire stake in FTT, citing concerns about FTX's financial health. This announcement triggered a sharp sell-off in FTT, as well as a broader decline in cryptocurrency markets.\n\nAs FTX's financial situation continued to deteriorate, Binance announced that it would be acquiring FTX in a deal that would have valued the company at $1. In a shocking turn of events, Binance withdrew its rescue bid just hours later, citing concerns about FTX's financial health and regulatory issues.\n\n### Bankruptcy and unauthorized transactions\n\nOn November 11, 2022, FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the US, citing assets of $10 billion to $50 billion and liabilities of $10 billion to $50 billion. Sam Bankman-Fried also resigned as CEO of FTX.\n\nIn the days following the bankruptcy filing, it was revealed that FTX had suffered from unauthorized transactions, with hackers stealing hundreds of millions of dollars in cryptocurrency from FTX's wallets.\n\n### Widening impact and contagion fears\n\nThe collapse of FTX sent shockwaves throughout the cryptocurrency industry, with many companies and investors exposed to FTX's financial troubles. Several prominent cryptocurrency companies, including BlockFi and Genesis, announced that they would be halting withdrawals or filing for bankruptcy.\n\nFears of contagion also spread to traditional financial markets, with many investors expressing concerns about the potential risks to the broader financial system.\n\n### Responses and effects\n\n#### Effects on investors\n\nThe collapse of FTX had a devastating impact on investors, many of whom lost millions of dollars in the collapse. Several high-profile investors, including Sequoia Capital and SoftBank, announced that they would be writing down their investments in FTX.\n\n#### Effects on other cryptocurrency firms and cryptocurrency markets\n\nThe collapse of FTX also had a significant impact on other cryptocurrency firms and markets. Several prominent cryptocurrency exchanges and companies announced that they would be halting withdrawals or filing for bankruptcy.\n\nCryptocurrency markets also suffered a sharp decline, with many major cryptocurrencies losing 10-20% of their value in the days following the collapse of FTX.\n\n#### Responses and commentary\n\nRegulators and lawmakers around the world expressed concern about the collapse of FTX, with many calling for increased regulation of the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nSeveral prominent figures in the cryptocurrency industry also weighed in on the collapse of FTX, with many expressing disappointment and frustration at the lack of transparency and accountability in the industry.\n\nLegal Process\n-------------\n\nThe collapse of FTX triggered a number of legal proceedings, including bankruptcy proceedings and regulatory investigations.\n\nIn the US, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced that they would be investigating FTX and its affiliates.\n\nSponsorships\n------------\n\nFTX was known for its high-profile sponsorships and partnerships, including a deal with the Miami Heat to rename their arena to FTX Arena.\n\nIn the wake of the collapse of FTX, several prominent sports teams and organizations announced that they would be ending their partnerships with FTX.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nExternal links\n---------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"FTX\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n#November 2022 crisis and bankruptcy\n##Background: FTX and Alameda, Binance, and CoinDesk report\n##Crisis begins: Binance FTT sale, sell-off, and withdrawn rescue bid\n##Bankruptcy and unauthorized transactions\n##Widening impact and contagion fears\n##Responses and effects\n###Effects on investors\n###Effects on other cryptocurrency firms and cryptocurrency markets\n###Responses and commentary\n#Legal process\n#Sponsorships\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The season has been quite active, with several tropical cyclones forming in the region.\n\n#Seasonal forecasts\n\nSeveral national meteorological agencies and scientific institutions forecast the number of tropical cyclones that will form in the South-West Indian Ocean during the season. The forecasts are based on various climate models and statistical analysis of past seasons. The agencies that provide forecasts for this region include the Mauritius Meteorological Service, the Réunion Meteorological Service, and the South African Weather Service.\n\nIn July 2022, the Mauritius Meteorological Service forecast that the season would be near-normal, with 8-10 named storms forming. The Réunion Meteorological Service also forecast a near-normal season, with 9-11 named storms expected. The South African Weather Service forecast a slightly above-average season, with 10-12 named storms forming.\n\n#Seasonal summary\n\nAs of March 2023, the season has seen 11 named storms form, making it an above-average season. The most intense storm of the season so far has been Very Intense Tropical Cyclone Freddy, which reached peak winds of 220 km/h (140 mph). The season has also seen several moderate tropical storms, including Ashley and Balita.\n\nThe season has been quite active in terms of the number of storms that have formed, but the intensity of the storms has been relatively low compared to previous seasons. The reason for this is the presence of a moderate El Niño event in the Pacific Ocean, which has led to increased wind shear in the South-West Indian Ocean.\n\n#Systems\n\n##Moderate Tropical Storm Ashley\n\nModerate Tropical Storm Ashley was the first named storm of the season. It formed on September 26, 2022, and dissipated on October 1, 2022.

It formed on October 15, 2022, and dissipated on October 22, 2022. The storm peaked at winds of 105 km/h (65 mph) and remained at sea.\n\n##Tropical Depression 03\n\nTropical Depression 03 was a short-lived tropical depression that formed on November 1, 2022, and dissipated on November 2, 2022. The storm did not strengthen into a named storm.\n\n##Very Intense Tropical Cyclone Darian\n\nVery Intense Tropical Cyclone Darian was the third named storm of the season. It formed on November 20, 2022, and dissipated on December 1, 2022.

The storm peaked at winds of 150 km/h (90 mph) and made landfall in Madagascar.\n\n##Tropical Cyclone Dingani\n\nTropical Cyclone Dingani was the fifth named storm of the season. It formed on February 9, 2023, and dissipated on February 16, 2023. The storm peaked at winds of 120 km/h (75 mph) and remained at sea.\n\n##Very Intense Tropical Cyclone Freddy\n\nVery Intense Tropical Cyclone Freddy was the sixth named storm of the season. It formed on February 17, 2023, and is currently active. The storm has peaked at winds of 220 km/h (140 mph) and is expected to make landfall in Mozambique.\n\n##Tropical Cyclone Enala\n\nTropical Cyclone Enala was the seventh named storm of the season. It formed on March 1, 2023, and dissipated on March 8, 2023. The storm peaked at winds of 100 km/h (65 mph) and remained at sea.\n\n##Moderate Tropical Storm 09\n\nModerate Tropical Storm 09 was the eighth named storm of the season. It formed on March 15, 2023, and dissipated on March 22, 2023. The storm peaked at winds of 110 km/h (70 mph) and remained at sea.\n\n##Intense Tropical Cyclone Fabien\n\nIntense Tropical Cyclone Fabien was the ninth named storm of the season. It formed on March 20, 2023, and is currently active. The storm has peaked at winds of 180 km/h (115 mph) and is expected to remain at sea.\n\n#Storm names\n\nThe storm names used for this season are taken from a list of names that was agreed upon by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The list of names is used in a cyclical manner, with the names of storms that caused significant damage or loss of life being retired.\n\n#Season effects\n\nThe 2022–23 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season has had significant effects on the region. The storms have caused widespread damage and disruption, particularly in Madagascar and Mozambique. The storms have also led to the loss of life, with several people reported dead or missing.\n\nThe season has also had significant economic impacts, particularly in the agricultural and fishing sectors. The storms have damaged crops and fishing infrastructure, leading to significant losses for farmers and fishermen.\n\n#See also\n\n* 2022–23 Australian region cyclone season\n* 2022–23 South Pacific cyclone season\n* List of South-West Indian Ocean cyclone seasons\n\n#References\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank as per the requirements)\n\n#External links\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank as per the requirements)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022–23_South-West_Indian_Ocean_cyclone_season\" following this outline:\n\n#Seasonal forecasts\n#Seasonal summary\n#Systems\n##Moderate Tropical Storm Ashley\n##Moderate Tropical Storm Balita\n##Tropical Depression 03\n##Very Intense Tropical Cyclone Darian\n##Tropical Cyclone Cheneso\n##Tropical Cyclone Dingani\n##Very Intense Tropical Cyclone Freddy\n##Tropical Cyclone Enala\n##Moderate Tropical Storm 09\n##Intense Tropical Cyclone Fabien\n#Storm names\n#Season effects\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

A member of the Republican Party, he is known for his conservative policies and his role in ending the Cold War. Reagan's presidency is often credited with helping to end the Cold War and is often regarded as one of the most influential presidencies of the 20th century.\n\n# Early life\n\nRonald Reagan was born on February 6, 1911, in a small apartment above a bank in Tampico, Illinois, to John Edward Reagan and Nelle Clyde Wilson Reagan. He was the younger of two sons. Reagan's father was of Irish Catholic descent, while his mother was of Scottish and English ancestry. The family moved to various towns in Illinois, including Galesburg, Monmouth, and Dixon, before settling in Dixon in 1920.\n\nReagan attended high school in Dixon, where he developed an interest in acting and sports. He was an average student, but he excelled in sports, particularly football, and was a member of the school's debate team. After graduating from high school in 1928, Reagan attended Eureka College, a small liberal arts college in Eureka, Illinois, where he studied economics and sociology. He graduated from Eureka College in 1932.\n\n# Entertainment career\n\n## Radio and film\n\nAfter graduating from college, Reagan moved to Iowa, where he worked as a radio announcer for several years. In 1937, he moved to Los Angeles, California, where he began working as an actor in films. Reagan's early film career was marked by small roles in B-movies, but he eventually landed a contract with Warner Bros. Studios. He appeared in over 50 films during the 1930s and 1940s, including the popular \"Knute Rockne, All American\" and \"Bedtime for Bonzo.\"\n\n## Military service\n\nIn 1942, Reagan enlisted in the United States Army Reserve, where he served for three years during World War II. Due to his poor eyesight, Reagan was classified as \"limited service only\" and was assigned to the Army Air Forces' First Motion Picture Unit, where he produced training films and propaganda films.\n\n## Screen Actors Guild presidency\n\nReagan became involved in the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) early in his career and served as the guild's president from 1947 to 1952 and again from 1959 to 1960. During his tenure as SAG president, Reagan helped to negotiate better pay and working conditions for actors.\n\n## Marriages and children\n\nReagan married actress Jane Wyman in 1940, and the couple had two children, Maureen and Michael. The couple divorced in 1948, and Reagan married actress Nancy Davis in 1952. The couple had two children, Patricia and Ronald Jr.\n\n## Television\n\nIn the 1950s, Reagan began working in television, hosting several game shows and appearing in various TV shows, including \"General Electric Theater\" and \"Death Valley Days.\" Reagan's work in television helped to establish him as a household name and laid the groundwork for his future career in politics.\n\n# Early political activities\n\n## 1966 California gubernatorial election\n\nIn 1966, Reagan ran for governor of California, winning the Republican primary and going on to defeat Democratic incumbent Pat Brown in the general election. Reagan's campaign focused on issues such as taxation, education, and law and order.\n\n# California governorship (1967–1975)\n\nReagan served as governor of California from 1967 to 1975. During his tenure, he implemented several conservative policies, including tax cuts and reductions in state spending. Reagan also took a tough stance on law and order, supporting the use of force to quell student protests and riots.\n\n# Seeking the presidency (1975–1981)\n\n## 1976 Republican primaries\n\nIn 1976, Reagan challenged incumbent President Gerald Ford for the Republican presidential nomination. Although Reagan lost the nomination, his campaign helped to establish him as a national figure and laid the groundwork for his future presidential campaigns.\n\n## 1980 election\n\nIn 1980, Reagan ran for president again, this time winning the Republican nomination and going on to defeat Democratic incumbent Jimmy Carter in the general election. Reagan's campaign focused on issues such as taxation, inflation, and national security.\n\n# Presidency (1981–1989)\n\n## First inauguration\n\nReagan was inaugurated as the 40th President of the United States on January 20, 1981. In his inaugural address, Reagan called for a reduction in government spending and a return to traditional American values.\n\n## \"Reaganomics\" and the economy\n\nReagan's economic policies, which became known as \"Reaganomics,\" were based on the idea of supply-side economics. The policies included tax cuts, deregulation, and reductions in government spending.\n\n### Taxation\n\nReagan implemented several major tax cuts during his presidency, including the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 and the Tax Reform Act of 1986. The tax cuts helped to stimulate economic growth and reduce the national debt.\n\n### Inflation and unemployment\n\nReagan's policies helped to reduce inflation and unemployment, which had been major problems during the 1970s. The inflation rate declined from 14.8% in 1980 to 4.1% in 1988, while the unemployment rate declined from 7.5% in 1980 to 5.3% in 1988.\n\n### Government spending\n\nReagan implemented several reductions in government spending, including cuts to social programs and defense spending. The reductions helped to reduce the national debt and stimulate economic growth.\n\n### Deregulation\n\nReagan implemented several major deregulation initiatives, including the deregulation of the banking and energy industries. The deregulation helped to stimulate economic growth and increase competition.\n\n### Deficits\n\nDespite the tax cuts and reductions in government spending, the national debt increased during Reagan's presidency, from $994 billion in 1980 to $2.1 trillion in 1988. The increase was due in part to the tax cuts and the costs of the Cold War.\n\n## Assassination attempt\n\nOn March 30, 1981, Reagan was shot by John Hinckley Jr. outside the Washington Hilton Hotel in Washington, D.C. Reagan survived the attempt on his life and returned to duty as president.\n\n## Supreme Court appointments\n\nReagan made several appointments to the Supreme Court, including Sandra Day O'Connor, William Rehnquist, Antonin Scalia, and Anthony Kennedy. The appointments helped to shape the court's conservative majority.\n\n## Public sector labor union fights\n\nReagan clashed with public sector labor unions, including the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (PATCO), which went on strike in 1981. Reagan fired the striking air traffic controllers and banned them from federal employment.\n\n## Civil rights\n\nReagan's record on civil rights was mixed. He supported the Martin Luther King Jr. federal holiday, but he also opposed several civil rights bills, including the Civil Rights Act of 1982.\n\n## War on drugs\n\nReagan launched a \"war on drugs\" in 1982, which included increased funding for law enforcement and anti-drug programs. The war on drugs helped to reduce drug use and trafficking, but it also led to increased incarceration rates.\n\n## Escalation of the Cold War\n\nReagan's presidency was marked by an escalation of the Cold War, including a military buildup and increased tensions with the Soviet Union. The escalation helped to contribute to the eventual collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\n## Invasion of Grenada\n\nIn 1983, Reagan ordered the invasion of Grenada, a small island nation in the Caribbean. The invasion was in response to a Marxist coup and the construction of a Soviet-funded airport.\n\n## 1984 election\n\nReagan won re-election in 1984, defeating Democratic challenger Walter Mondale in a landslide. The election was marked by a strong economy and a popular president.\n\n## Response to the AIDS epidemic\n\nReagan's response to the AIDS epidemic was slow, and he did not publicly address the issue until 1985. The delay in response contributed to the spread of the disease and criticism of the administration's handling of the epidemic.\n\n## Addressing apartheid\n\nReagan's administration was criticized for its handling of apartheid in South Africa. Reagan vetoed several bills aimed at imposing sanctions on the South African government, but Congress overrode the vetoes.\n\n## Libya bombing\n\nIn 1986, Reagan ordered the bombing of Libya in response to Libyan sponsorship of terrorism. The bombing helped to reduce Libyan support for terrorism.\n\n## Iran–Contra affair\n\nThe Iran–Contra affair was a major scandal that emerged during Reagan's presidency. The scandal involved the sale of arms to Iran and the diversion of funds to support anti-Sandinista rebels in Nicaragua. Reagan's administration was criticized for its handling of the scandal.\n\n## The USS Stark incident\n\nIn 1987, the USS Stark was attacked by an Iraqi missile, killing 37 American sailors. The incident was a major embarrassment for the administration and led to increased tensions with Iraq.\n\n## Soviet decline and thaw in relations\n\nDuring Reagan's presidency, the Soviet Union began to decline, and relations between the two superpowers began to thaw. The decline and thaw were due in part to Reagan's policies, including the military buildup and increased diplomatic efforts.\n\n# Post-presidency (1989–2004)\n\n## Support for Brady Bill\n\nAfter leaving office, Reagan supported the Brady Bill, a gun control bill that was signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1993.\n\n## Alzheimer's disease\n\nIn 1994, Reagan was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, a degenerative brain disorder. Reagan's diagnosis helped to raise awareness of the disease and increase funding for research.\n\n## Death and funeral\n\nReagan died on June 5, 2004, at the age of 93, due to complications from Alzheimer's disease. Reagan's funeral was a major event, with tributes from around the world.\n\n# Legacy\n\n## Historical reputation\n\nReagan's historical reputation is complex and multifaceted. He is remembered as a strong leader who helped to end the Cold War and stimulate economic growth. However, he is also criticized for his handling of social issues and the national debt.\n\n## Political influence\n\nReagan's influence on American politics has been significant. He helped to shape the Republican Party's conservative agenda and inspired a generation of politicians, including George W. Bush and Donald Trump.\n\n# Notes\n\n# References\n\n## Citations\n\n## Works cited\n\n### Books\n\n### Chapters\n\n### Journal articles\n\n# External links\n\n## Official sites\n\n## Media\n\n## News coverage\n\n## Other", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Ronald_Reagan\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n#Entertainment career\n##Radio and film\n##Military service\n##Screen Actors Guild presidency\n##Marriages and children\n##Television\n#Early political activities\n##1966 California gubernatorial election\n#California governorship (1967–1975)\n#Seeking the presidency (1975–1981)\n##1976 Republican primaries\n##1980 election\n#Presidency (1981–1989)\n##First inauguration\n##\"Reaganomics\" and the economy\n###Taxation\n###Inflation and unemployment\n###Government spending\n###Deregulation\n###Deficits\n##Assassination attempt\n##Supreme Court appointments\n##Public sector labor union fights\n##Civil rights\n##War on drugs\n##Escalation of the Cold War\n##Invasion of Grenada\n##1984 election\n##Response to the AIDS epidemic\n##Addressing apartheid\n##Libya bombing\n##Iran–Contra affair\n##The USS Stark incident\n##Soviet decline and thaw in relations\n#Post-presidency (1989–2004)\n##Support for Brady Bill\n##Alzheimer's disease\n##Death and funeral\n#Legacy\n##Historical reputation\n##Political influence\n#Notes\n#References\n##Citations\n##Works cited\n###Books\n###Chapters\n###Journal articles\n#External links\n##Official sites\n##Media\n##News coverage\n##Other\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The city of Mariupol, located in the Donetsk Oblast of Ukraine, was a strategic port city and a key industrial center, making it a crucial target for both sides. The siege began in early 2014 and continued intermittently until 2022, with periods of relative calm punctuated by intense fighting and humanitarian crises.\n\n# Background\n\nMariupol, a city of approximately 450,000 inhabitants, is located on the Sea of Azov, about 30 kilometers from the Russian border. Prior to the conflict, the city was a major industrial center, with a significant steel production facility, the Azovstal steel plant, and a major port. The city's location and economic importance made it a key prize for both Ukrainian and Russian-backed forces.\n\nIn 2014, following the Ukrainian Revolution and the subsequent annexation of Crimea by Russia, pro-Russian separatists declared the establishment of the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) and the Luhansk People's Republic (LPR) in eastern Ukraine. The conflict escalated, with Ukrainian forces engaging in combat with separatist militias and Russian-backed forces.\n\n# Advances to Mariupol\n\n## Preliminary shelling and advance on the city\n\nIn August 2014, Russian-backed separatist forces, supported by the Russian military, launched a major offensive against Ukrainian forces in the Donetsk Oblast. The separatists made significant gains, capturing several key cities and towns, including Novoazovsk, a strategic town located about 30 kilometers east of Mariupol.\n\nAs the separatists advanced, they began to shell Mariupol, causing significant damage to the city's infrastructure and civilian casualties. Ukrainian forces, supported by volunteer militias, defended the city, but were largely outnumbered and outgunned.\n\n## Mariupol surrounded\n\nBy September 2014, Mariupol was surrounded by separatist forces, with the city's access to the sea and its main supply routes cut off. The Ukrainian military launched a series of counterattacks, but were unable to break the separatist siege.\n\nThe city's residents suffered greatly during this period, with limited access to food, water, and medical supplies. The humanitarian situation deteriorated, with reports of looting, violence, and human rights abuses.\n\n# Urban advances\n\n## Russian push into the city\n\nIn February 2022, Russian forces, supported by separatist militias, launched a major offensive against Mariupol, with the aim of capturing the city and securing a land bridge between the DPR and Crimea.\n\nThe Russian military used advanced artillery, air power, and infantry to push into the city, causing widespread destruction and civilian casualties. Ukrainian forces defended the city, but were largely outnumbered and outgunned.\n\n## Final pockets of resistance\n\nBy April 2022, Russian forces had captured most of the city, with Ukrainian forces retreating to the Azovstal steel plant, a heavily fortified facility located on the outskirts of the city.\n\nThe Ukrainian military, supported by volunteer militias, continued to resist, but were largely surrounded and cut off from the rest of Ukraine.\n\n# Resistance in the Azovstal steel plant\n\n## Withdrawal to Azovstal\n\nIn March 2022, Ukrainian forces withdrew to the Azovstal steel plant, a heavily fortified facility located on the outskirts of Mariupol. The plant, which had been damaged during the fighting, became a symbol of Ukrainian resistance against the Russian military.\n\nThe Ukrainian military, supported by volunteer militias, defended the plant, using its tunnels and bunkers to launch counterattacks against Russian forces.\n\n## Siege of Azovstal\n\nRussian forces besieged the Azovstal steel plant, using artillery, air power, and infantry to try and capture the facility. The Ukrainian military defended the plant, but were largely outnumbered and outgunned.\n\nThe humanitarian situation inside the plant deteriorated, with reports of limited access to food, water, and medical supplies.\n\n## Evacuation of civilians\n\nIn April 2022, a humanitarian corridor was established, allowing civilians to evacuate the Azovstal steel plant. The evacuation was facilitated by the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross.\n\nHowever, the evacuation was not without controversy, with reports of Russian forces firing on civilians attempting to flee the plant.\n\n## Ukrainian surrender\n\nOn May 20, 2022, Ukrainian forces surrendered the Azovstal steel plant to Russian forces, marking the end of the siege of Mariupol. The Ukrainian military had defended the city for over two months, but were ultimately unable to hold out against the Russian military.\n\n# Aftermath\n\n## Demolition of buildings and Russification of the city\n\nFollowing the capture of Mariupol, Russian forces began to demolish buildings and infrastructure, with the aim of rebuilding the city in a Russian style.\n\nThe city's residents were forced to adapt to a new reality, with Russian language and culture becoming dominant.\n\n## Last Ukrainian holdouts and prisoners of war\n\nSome Ukrainian soldiers remained in hiding, continuing to resist the Russian occupation. However, many were captured and taken prisoner by Russian forces.\n\nThe treatment of Ukrainian prisoners of war was widely criticized, with reports of torture, abuse, and human rights violations.\n\n## City government's role\n\nThe city government of Mariupol was forced to cooperate with Russian authorities, with the city's mayor and other officials being replaced by pro-Russian appointees.\n\nThe city's residents were forced to adapt to a new reality, with Russian language and culture becoming dominant.\n\n## Claimed cholera outbreak\n\nIn June 2022, Ukrainian officials claimed that a cholera outbreak had occurred in Mariupol, with reports of limited access to clean water and sanitation.\n\nThe Russian military denied the claims, but the humanitarian situation in the city remained dire.\n\n## Ukrainian missile strikes\n\nIn July 2022, Ukrainian forces launched a series of missile strikes against Russian-occupied Mariupol, targeting military facilities and infrastructure.\n\nThe strikes were seen as a response to the Russian occupation of the city, and the humanitarian crisis that had unfolded.\n\n# Casualties\n\n## Military casualties\n\nEstimates of military casualties during the siege of Mariupol vary widely, with some reports suggesting that up to 1,000 Ukrainian soldiers were killed or wounded.\n\nRussian military casualties were also significant, with some reports suggesting that up to 500 Russian soldier", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Siege_of_Mariupol\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Advances to Mariupol\n##Preliminary shelling and advance on the city\n##Mariupol surrounded\n#Urban advances\n##Russian push into the city\n##Final pockets of resistance\n#Resistance in the Azovstal steel plant\n##Withdrawal to Azovstal\n##Siege of Azovstal\n##Evacuation of civilians\n##Ukrainian surrender\n#Aftermath\n##Demolition of buildings and Russification of the city\n##Last Ukrainian holdouts and prisoners of war\n##City government's role\n##Claimed cholera outbreak\n##Ukrainian missile strikes\n#Casualties\n##Military casualties\n##Civilian casualties\n#Humanitarian situation\n#War crimes committed by Russian forces\n##Shooting of evacuation checkpoints\n##Maternity and children's hospital bombing\n##Regional theatre bombing\n##Mass shelling of residential areas\n##Alleged use of chemical weapons\n#Media coverage\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He played a significant role in the defeat of the Spanish Armada and was a prominent figure in the Elizabethan era.\n\nBirth and Early Years\n---------------------\n\nFrancis Drake was born in 1540 in Tavistock, Devon, England. His father, Edmund Drake, was a tenant farmer who later became a Protestant minister. Francis was the eldest of twelve children, and his family was considered to be of moderate means. Little is known about Drake's childhood, but it is believed that he was educated at a local school in Tavistock.\n\nEarly Career at Sea\n--------------------\n\nDrake's early career at sea began when he was apprenticed to a merchant shipowner in Plymouth. He quickly rose through the ranks and became a master mariner in his own right. In the 1560s, Drake made several voyages to the Caribbean and the west coast of Africa, where he became involved in the slave trade.\n\n### Slave Trade\n\nDrake's involvement in the slave trade was a significant aspect of his early career. He made several voyages to the Caribbean, where he would capture Spanish ships and sell their cargo, including slaves. Drake's activities in the slave trade were not unusual for the time, but they have been widely criticized by modern historians.\n\n### Expedition of 1572–1573\n\nIn 1572, Drake embarked on an expedition to the Caribbean with a fleet of three ships. The expedition was a private venture, and Drake's goal was to capture Spanish ships and plunder their cargo. The expedition was successful, and Drake returned to England with a significant amount of treasure.\n\n### Rathlin Island Massacre\n\nIn 1575, Drake was involved in the Rathlin Island massacre, in which a group of English privateers attacked and killed several hundred Scottish and Irish mercenaries who were stationed on the island. The massacre was widely condemned, and Drake's role in it has been the subject of much debate among historians.\n\nCircumnavigation (1577–1580)\n---------------------------\n\nDrake's most famous voyage was his circumnavigation of the globe, which took place from 1577 to 1580. The voyage was a private venture, and Drake's goal was to capture Spanish ships and plunder their cargo.\n\n### Execution of Thomas Doughty\n\nIn 1578, Drake had one of his officers, Thomas Doughty, executed for mutiny. The execution was a significant event in the voyage, and it marked a turning point in Drake's relationship with his crew.\n\n### Entering the Pacific (1578)\n\nIn 1578, Drake's fleet entered the Pacific Ocean, becoming the first English ships to do so. The expedition was a significant milestone in the history of exploration, and it marked the beginning of English involvement in the Pacific.\n\n### Raids on Spanish American West Coast\n\nDrake's fleet raided several Spanish towns on the west coast of South America, including Valparaíso and Callao. The raids were successful, and Drake captured a significant amount of treasure.\n\n### Coast of California: Nova Albion (1579)\n\nIn 1579, Drake's fleet arrived on the coast of California, which he claimed for England and named Nova Albion. The expedition was a significant event in the history of California, and it marked the beginning of English involvement in the region.\n\n### Across the Pacific and around Africa\n\nDrake's fleet sailed across the Pacific and around Africa, becoming the first English ships to circumnavigate the globe. The voyage was a significant achievement, and it marked a major milestone in the history of exploration.\n\n### Return to Plymouth (1580)\n\nDrake's fleet returned to Plymouth in 1580, where they were greeted as heroes. The voyage had been a significant success, and Drake had captured a large amount of treasure.\n\n### Knighthood and Arms\n\nDrake was knighted by Queen Elizabeth I in 1581, and he was granted a coat of arms. The knighthood was a significant honor, and it marked a major milestone in Drake's career.\n\nPolitical Career\n----------------\n\nDrake's political career began in the 1580s, when he was elected to Parliament. He served in Parliament for several years, during which time he became a prominent advocate for the English navy.\n\nGreat Expedition to America\n---------------------------\n\nIn 1585, Drake led a great expedition to America, which was intended to establish an English settlement in the New World. The expedition was a significant failure, and Drake returned to England with a large number of casualties.\n\nConflict with the Spanish Armada\n--------------------------------\n\nDrake's most famous conflict was with the Spanish Armada, which took place in 1588. The Armada was a massive fleet of Spanish ships that was intended to invade England and overthrow Queen Elizabeth I.\n\n### Cádiz Raid\n\nIn 1587, Drake led a raid on the Spanish port of Cádiz, which was a significant blow to the Spanish navy. The raid was a major success, and it marked a turning point in the conflict with the Spanish Armada.\n\n### Defeat of the Spanish Armada\n\nIn 1588, Drake played a significant role in the defeat of the Spanish Armada. The Armada was a massive fleet of Spanish ships that was intended to invade England and overthrow Queen Elizabeth I. The defeat of the Armada was a major turning point in English history, and it marked the beginning of English supremacy at sea.\n\n### English Armada\n\nIn 1589, Drake led an English Armada to Portugal, which was intended to overthrow the Spanish-backed government. The expedition was a significant failure, and Drake returned to England with a large number of casualties.\n\nDefeats and Death\n-----------------\n\nDrake's later years were marked by a series of defeats and setbacks.

The incident has sparked controversy and raised questions about the handling of classified information by the President and his team.\n\n#Background\n\nAs Vice President under Barack Obama, Joe Biden had access to classified information, which is typically stored in secure facilities and handled by authorized personnel. After leaving office in 2017, Biden established the Penn Biden Center, a think tank affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania, where he served as the Benjamin Franklin Presidential Practice Professor. The center was located in a secure building in Washington, D.C., and Biden would occasionally visit the center to work on various projects.\n\n#Discoveries and other developments\n\n##First batch of documents\n\nIn November 2022, Biden's lawyers discovered a batch of classified documents at the Penn Biden Center, which were reportedly from his time as Vice President. The documents were said to be related to Ukraine, Iran, and the United Kingdom. Biden's lawyers immediately notified the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), which took possession of the documents.\n\n##DOJ letter to Bob Bauer\n\nOn November 9, 2022, Attorney General Merrick Garland wrote to Bob Bauer, a lawyer and former White House counsel, informing him that the Justice Department was investigating the matter. Garland asked Bauer to confirm that the documents had been found and to provide any additional information about their discovery.\n\n##Second batch of documents\n\nOn December 20, 2022, Biden's lawyers discovered a second batch of classified documents at his home in Wilmington, Delaware. The documents were reportedly from his time as Vice President and were related to topics such as Ukraine, Iran, and China.\n\n##FBI search of Biden's Wilmington home\n\nOn January 20, 2023, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) conducted a search of Biden's home in Wilmington, Delaware, in connection with the investigation into the classified documents. The search was reportedly voluntary, and Biden's lawyers cooperated with the FBI.\n\n##Other searches\n\nIn addition to the FBI search of Biden's home, the Justice Department also searched the Penn Biden Center in Washington, D.C. for any additional classified documents.\n\n#Initial responses\n\n##Biden and his legal team\n\nBiden's lawyers stated that the President had cooperated fully with the investigation and had taken steps to ensure that any classified documents were properly stored and handled. Biden himself said that he was \"surprised\" to learn that the documents had been found at his home and at the Penn Biden Center.\n\n##Elected officials\n\n###Republican elected officials\n\nMany Republican elected officials criticized Biden for the discovery of the classified documents, with some calling for his impeachment. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) said that Biden's handling of the documents was \"inexcusable\" and that he should be held accountable.\n\n###Democratic elected officials\n\nDemocratic elected officials generally defended Biden, with some arguing that the discovery of the classified documents was an honest mistake. Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) said that Biden had \"taken responsibility\" for the mistake and that the investigation should be allowed to proceed.\n\n##Media analysis\n\nThe discovery of the classified documents sparked widespread media coverage, with many outlets analyzing the implications of the incident. Some commentators argued that the incident raised questions about Biden's judgment and his ability to handle sensitive information.\n\n##Misinformation\n\nIn the days following the discovery of the classified documents, misinformation about the incident spread rapidly on social media. Some users claimed that Biden had intentionally mishandled the documents or that the incident was part of a larger conspiracy.\n\n##Discovery of classified documents at Mike Pence's residence\n\nIn February 2023, it was reported that classified documents had also been found at the residence of former Vice President Mike Pence. The documents were reportedly from Pence's time as Vice President under Donald Trump.\n\n#Investigations\n\n##Special counsel\n\nIn January 2023, Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed a special counsel to investigate the discovery of the classified documents. The special counsel, Robert Hur, was tasked with determining whether any laws had been broken and whether charges should be brought.\n\n###Decision that charges were unwarranted\n\nIn May 2023, the special counsel announced that charges were unwarranted in the case, citing a lack of evidence of intentional wrongdoing.\n\n###Comments on Biden's memory\n\nThe special counsel also commented on Biden's memory, saying that the President had shown a \"lack of awareness\" about the classified documents and their location.\n\n##Congressional\n\nIn addition to the special counsel investigation, Congress also launched an investigation into the discovery of the classified documents. The investigation was led by the House Oversight Committee, which held hearings and gathered evidence related to the incident.\n\n#See also\n\n* Classified information in the United States\n* National Archives and Records Administration\n* Federal Bureau of Investigation\n* Special counsel investigation\n* Congressional oversight", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Joe_Biden_classified_documents_incident\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Discoveries and other developments\n##First batch of documents\n##DOJ letter to Bob Bauer\n##Second batch of documents\n##FBI search of Biden's Wilmington home\n##Other searches\n#Initial responses\n##Biden and his legal team\n##Elected officials\n###Republican elected officials\n###Democratic elected officials\n##Media analysis\n##Misinformation\n##Discovery of classified documents at Mike Pence's residence\n#Investigations\n##Special counsel\n###Decision that charges were unwarranted\n###Comments on Biden's memory\n##Congressional\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The battle took place from 22 to 25 April 1951, in the Kapyong Valley, South Korea, and was a decisive UNC victory.\n\n#Background\n\n##Military situation\n\nIn the spring of 1951, the Korean War was in its second year. The UNC, led by General Matthew Ridgway, had been pushing the PVA back since the Chinese intervention in November 1950. However, the PVA had regrouped and was preparing to launch a massive spring offensive, aimed at recapturing the strategic city of Seoul. The UNC was aware of the impending attack and had been reinforcing its positions along the 38th parallel, the pre-war border between North and South Korea.\n\n#Chinese Spring Offensive\n\n##Preparations\n\nThe PVA had been preparing for its spring offensive since February 1951. The Chinese had assembled a massive force, consisting of over 700,000 troops, and had been secretly moving them into position along the 38th parallel. The PVA had also been conducting a series of probes and reconnaissance missions, aimed at testing the UNC defenses and identifying weak points.\n\n##Launch of Chinese Spring Offensive\n\nOn 22 April 1951, the PVA launched its spring offensive, with a massive artillery barrage and simultaneous attacks along the entire 38th parallel. The UNC was caught off guard, and many of its positions were quickly overrun. The PVA made rapid gains, pushing the UNC back and creating a series of gaps in the line.\n\n##South Korean withdrawal, 22–23 April 1951\n\nAs the PVA advanced, the South Korean army (ROK) began to falter. Many ROK units were poorly trained and equipped, and they were quickly overwhelmed by the sheer size and ferocity of the PVA attack. On 22 April, the ROK 6th Division, which was holding the Kapyong Valley, began to withdraw in disarray. The withdrawal quickly turned into a rout, as the ROK troops abandoned their positions and fled south.\n\n#Australian 3 RAR defence of Hill 504, 23–24 April 1951\n\n##Night battle\n\nAs the ROK troops withdrew, the Australian 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3 RAR), which was holding Hill 504, a strategic position overlooking the Kapyong Valley, found itself isolated and surrounded. On the night of 23 April, the PVA launched a fierce attack on Hill 504, using mortars, machine guns, and infantry. The Australians held their ground, but they were vastly outnumbered and outgunned.\n\n##Day battle\n\nOn 24 April, the PVA launched a second attack on Hill 504, this time using tanks and infantry. The Australians were again heavily outnumbered, but they held their ground, using their artillery and mortar fire to devastating effect. The PVA attack was eventually repelled, but the Australians had suffered heavy casualties.\n\n##3 RAR withdraws\n\nAs the day wore on, the Australians realized that their position was untenable. They were surrounded, outnumbered, and outgunned, and they were in danger of being cut off and annihilated. On the evening of 24 April, the 3 RAR withdrew from Hill 504, under the cover of darkness and artillery fire.\n\n#Canadian 2 PPCLI last stand on Hill 677, 24–25 April 1951\n\n##Preparations\n\nAs the Australians withdrew from Hill 504, the Canadian 2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry (2 PPCLI), which was holding Hill 677, a strategic position overlooking the Kapyong Valley, prepared for its own last stand. The Canadians knew that they were in a precarious position, surrounded by the PVA and outnumbered.\n\n##Night battle\n\nOn the night of 24 April, the PVA launched a fierce attack on Hill 677, using mortars, machine guns, and infantry. The Canadians held their ground, but they were vastly outnumbered and outgunned. The battle raged on for hours, with the Canadians fighting for every inch of ground.\n\n##Final 2 PPCLI Operations\n\nAs the night wore on, the Canadians realized that their position was untenable. They were surrounded, outnumbered, and outgunned, and they were in danger of being cut off and annihilated. On the morning of 25 April, the 2 PPCLI launched a series of desperate counterattacks, aimed at breaking through the PVA lines and linking up with the rest of the UNC forces. The counterattacks were successful, and the Canadians were eventually able to withdraw from Hill 677, under the cover of artillery fire.\n\n#Aftermath\n\n##Summary and casualties\n\nThe Battle of Kapyong was a decisive UNC victory, but it came at a heavy cost. The UNC had suffered over 1,000 casualties, including 400 killed, while the PVA had lost an estimated 10,000 troops. The battle had also marked a turning point in the Korean War, as the PVA had been repelled and the UNC had gained the initiative.\n\n##Awards\n\nThe Battle of Kapyong was one of the most decorated battles of the Korean War. The Australians, Canadians, and New Zealanders had all fought with distinction, and many of their troops had been awarded medals for bravery. The battle had also marked the first time that the Australian, Canadian, and New Zealand armies had fought together, and it had forged a lasting bond between the three nations.\n\n##Subsequent operations\n\nThe Battle of Kapyong marked the beginning of a series of UNC operations aimed at driving the PVA back and recapturing the strategic city of Seoul. The UNC launched a series of attacks, including Operation Commando and Operation Ripper, which eventually pushed the PVA back and secured the city of Seoul. The Korean War would continue for another two years, but the Battle of Kapyong had marked a decisive turning point in the conflict.\n\n#See also\n\n* Korean War\n* United Nations Command\n* Chinese People's Volunteer Army\n* Australian Army\n* Canadian Army\n* New Zealand Army\n\n#Notes\n\n##Footnotes\n\n* The Battle of Kapyong was one of the most significant battles of the Korean War, and it marked a turning point in the conflict.\n* The UNC had suffered heavy casualties during the battle, but they had ultimately emerged victorious.\n* The PVA had lost an estimated 10,000 troops during the battle, and they had been repelled.\n\n##Citations\n\n* \"The Battle of Kapyong\".

As a member of the Anglo-Norman aristocracy, Cruys held various titles and properties throughout Ireland, including the prestigious Merrion Castle. His life and career are a testament to the complex web of alliances, rivalries, and power struggles that characterized the medieval Irish nobility.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nJohn Cruys was born into a prominent Anglo-Norman family that had settled in Ireland in the 12th century. His ancestors had arrived in Ireland as part of the Norman invasion of 1169, led by Earl Richard de Clare, also known as Strongbow. Over the centuries, the Cruys family had established themselves as a powerful and influential force in Irish society, with significant landholdings and titles.\n\nMerrion Castle and other Cruys holdings\n--------------------------------------\n\nOne of the most significant properties held by the Cruys family was Merrion Castle, located in what is now County Dublin. Merrion Castle was a strategically important fortress that controlled access to the city of Dublin and the surrounding countryside. The castle had been built by the Cruys family in the 13th century and had been the seat of their power and influence for generations.\n\nIn addition to Merrion Castle, the Cruys family held other significant properties throughout Ireland, including lands in County Kildare, County Meath, and County Louth. These properties were crucial to the family's wealth and influence, providing them with a significant source of income and power.\n\nCareer\n--------\n\nJohn Cruys began his career as a young nobleman, serving as a member of the retinue of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. He quickly proved himself to be a skilled and capable military leader, participating in several campaigns against the native Irish and rival Anglo-Norman families.\n\nIn the 1360s, Cruys was appointed as the Constable of Dublin Castle, a prestigious position that gave him control over the city and its defenses. He played a key role in the defense of the city against the native Irish and was instrumental in maintaining order and stability in the region.\n\nThe Verdon inheritance\n----------------------\n\nIn the 1370s, Cruys inherited a significant portion of the Verdon estates, which included lands in County Louth and County Meath. The Verdon family had been prominent Anglo-Norman landowners in Ireland, and their estates were highly prized for their strategic location and economic value.\n\nThe inheritance of the Verdon estates significantly increased Cruys' wealth and influence, making him one of the most powerful nobles in Ireland. He used his newfound wealth and power to expand his holdings and consolidate his position as a leading member of the Anglo-Norman aristocracy.\n\nLater career\n-------------\n\nIn the 1380s, Cruys continued to play a significant role in Irish politics and society. He served as a member of the Irish Parliament and was involved in several high-profile disputes with rival noble families.\n\nDespite his advanced age, Cruys remained a formidable figure in Irish society, respected for his military prowess and his unwavering commitment to the Anglo-Norman cause. He died in the early 1390s, leaving behind a legacy as one of the most influential and powerful nobles of his generation.\n\nFamily\n--------\n\nJohn Cruys was married to a member of the prominent Anglo-Norman family, the de Berminghams. His wife was a member of the family that had founded the monastery of Athenry in County Galway, and the couple had several children together.\n\nCruys' children went on to play significant roles in Irish society, with several of them becoming prominent nobles and landowners in their own right. His descendants continued to play a major role in Irish politics and society for centuries, with many of them serving as members of the Irish Parliament and holding high-ranking positions in the government and military.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland\n* Merrion Castle\n* Verdon family\n* de Bermingham family\n* Irish Parliament\n\nSources\n--------\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements of the assignment)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"John_Cruys\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Merrion Castle and other Cruys holdings\n#Career\n#The Verdon inheritance\n#Later career\n#Family\n#See also\n#Sources\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

With a population of around 6 million people, the Bugis are one of the largest ethnic groups in Sulawesi. They have a rich and complex culture, history, and tradition that dates back to the pre-Austronesian era.\n\n#Origins and antecedents\n\n##Toalean — Pre-Austronesian South Sulawesi\n\nThe history of the Bugis people began with the Toalean, a pre-Austronesian people who inhabited the southern part of Sulawesi from around 8000 to 1500 BCE. The Toalean were hunter-gatherers who lived in small settlements and subsisted on a diet of fish, shellfish, and wild game. They are known for their sophisticated stone tools and pottery.\n\n##The arrival of Austronesians\n\nAround 1500 BCE, Austronesian-speaking peoples arrived in Sulawesi, bringing with them new technologies, social structures, and languages. The Austronesians intermarried with the Toalean, and over time, the Toalean culture was absorbed into the Austronesian culture. The Austronesians introduced new crops such as rice, which became a staple crop in Sulawesi.\n\n##Tana Ogi — Land of the Bugis\n\nThe Bugis people emerged as a distinct ethnic group around the 13th century. The name \"Bugis\" is derived from the word \"Ugi,\" which refers to the Bugis kingdom of Luwu. The Bugis people call their homeland \"Tana Ogi,\" which means \"Land of the Bugis.\" Tana Ogi refers to the fertile valleys and plains of southern Sulawesi, where the Bugis people established their kingdoms and developed their culture.\n\n#History\n\n##Early society\n\nEarly Bugis society was organized into small kingdoms and chiefdoms, each with its own ruler and social hierarchy. The Bugis people were skilled farmers, fishermen, and traders, and their economy was based on agriculture, fishing, and trade. They were also known for their expertise in metalworking, particularly in the production of iron and steel.\n\n##The growth of Bugis kingdoms\n\nOver time, the Bugis kingdoms grew in power and influence, and by the 16th century, they had established themselves as major players in the regional trade network. The Bugis kingdoms of Makassar and Bone became major centers of trade and commerce, attracting merchants and traders from all over Southeast Asia.\n\n##Emergence of new political strengths over the peninsula\n\nIn the 17th century, the Bugis kingdoms began to decline, and new political powers emerged in Sulawesi. The Makassar kingdom, which had been a major power in the region, was defeated by the Dutch in 1669, and the Bugis people were forced to adapt to Dutch colonial rule.\n\n##Bugis-Makassar society in the 16th century\n\nBugis-Makassar society in the 16th century was characterized by a complex system of social hierarchy and nobility. The nobility were composed of the rulers and their families, who held power and influence over the kingdom. The common people were divided into different classes, including farmers, fishermen, and artisans.\n\n##Early attempts to Christianize the Bugis states\n\nIn the 16th century, European missionaries, particularly the Portuguese and Dutch, attempted to Christianize the Bugis states. However, these attempts were met with resistance from the Bugis people, who were committed to their traditional beliefs and practices.\n\n##Quest for prestige, influence and powers over the peninsula\n\nThroughout their history, the Bugis people have been driven by a quest for prestige, influence, and power over the peninsula. They have been known for their military prowess and their ability to navigate the complex web of alliances and rivalries that characterized the region.\n\n##The Islamisation of Bugis-Makassar-Mandar\n\nIn the 17th century, Islam began to spread throughout Sulawesi, and the Bugis people were among the first to adopt the new faith. Islam had a profound impact on Bugis culture and society, and it remains an important part of Bugis identity to this day.\n\n##The twilight of dominance\n\nBy the 19th century, the Bugis people had lost much of their former dominance over the region. The Dutch had established colonial rule over Sulawesi, and the Bugis kingdoms had been reduced to mere vassal states.\n\n##A new golden age\n\nIn the 20th century, the Bugis people experienced a new golden age, as they began to reassert their cultural and economic dominance over the region. Today, the Bugis people are a major force in Sulawesi, and their culture and traditions continue to thrive.\n\n#Culture\n\n##Language and dialects\n\nThe Bugis language is an Austronesian language that is spoken by around 6 million people in Sulawesi. There are several dialects of the Bugis language, including the Luwu dialect, which is spoken in the Luwu kingdom.\n\n##Philosophy\n\nBugis philosophy is based on the concept of \"siri',\" which refers to the idea of honor and prestige. The Bugis people place a high value on honor and prestige, and they believe that these values are essential to maintaining social harmony and balance.\n\n##Traditional script\n\nThe Bugis people have a traditional script, known as the \"Lontara\" script, which is used to write the Bugis language. The Lontara script is an ancient script that dates back to the 13th century.\n\n##Folklore and literary traditions\n\nThe Bugis people have a rich tradition of folklore and literature, which includes stories, poems, and songs. Bugis folklore is characterized by stories of heroes and heroines, who embody the values of honor, courage, and loyalty.\n\n##Dress, textiles and weaving traditions\n\nThe Bugis people are known for their beautiful textiles and weaving traditions. Bugis women are skilled weavers, and they produce intricate and colorful fabrics that are highly prized throughout the region.\n\n##Culinary traditions\n\nBugis cuisine is characterized by a rich and diverse array of dishes, including fish, meat, and vegetable dishes. Bugis people are known for their love of spicy food, and their cuisine is flavored with a variety of spices and herbs.\n\n##Weaponry and military traditions\n\nThe Bugis people have a long tradition of military prowess, and they are known for their expertise in warfare. Bugis warriors are skilled in the use of swords, spears, and other traditional weapons.\n\n##Traditional architecture\n\nBugis traditional architecture is characterized by the use of wood and thatch, and the construction of houses and other buildings that are designed to withstand the tropical climate.\n\n##Maritime, mercantile and migratory traditions\n\nThe Bugis people have a long tradition of maritime trade and commerce, and they are skilled navigators and sailors. Bugis people have migrated to many parts of the world, including Malaysia, the Philippines, and Australia.\n\n##Rice and agrarian traditions\n\nThe Bugis people are skilled farmers, and they place a high value on rice and other crops.

She is the leader of the Brothers of Italy party and the first female Prime Minister in Italian history.\n\n# Early life\n\nGiorgia Meloni was born on January 15, 1977, in Rome, Italy. Her father, Francesco Meloni, was a tax consultant, and her mother, Anna Paratore, was a hairdresser. Meloni's parents divorced when she was young, and she was raised by her mother in the Garbatella neighborhood of Rome.\n\n## Education and early political activism\n\nMeloni attended the Aristide Gabelli high school in Rome, where she became involved in student activism and joined the youth wing of the Italian Social Movement (MSI), a neo-fascist party. She graduated from high school in 1996 and went on to study foreign languages and literature at the Sapienza University of Rome, although she did not complete her degree.\n\nMeloni's involvement in politics began at a young age, and she quickly rose through the ranks of the MSI's youth wing. In 1996, she was elected as the national leader of Student Action, the MSI's student organization.\n\n# Political career\n\n## Minister of Youth\n\nIn 2006, Meloni was elected to the Italian Chamber of Deputies, representing the National Alliance (AN) party, which was the successor to the MSI.

The reforms have been met with opposition from some parties and civil society groups.\n\n## Foreign policy\n\nMeloni's government has taken a strong stance on a number of foreign policy issues, including the conflict in Ukraine and the relationship with the European Union.

They make up approximately 30-35% of Lebanon's population, with the majority belonging to the Shia Twelver (Metouali) sect. Lebanese Shia Muslims have a rich and complex history, with origins dating back to the early Islamic period. Throughout the centuries, they have maintained a distinct cultural and religious identity, shaped by their unique experiences and interactions with various empires and regimes.\n\n# History\n\n## Origins\n\nThe origins of Shia Islam in Lebanon date back to the 7th century, when the region was part of the Rashidun Caliphate. During this period, many Shia Muslims migrated to the area, attracted by the region's fertile soil and strategic location. The Shia community in Lebanon grew rapidly, particularly in the Bekaa Valley and the southern regions of the country.\n\n## Early Islamic period\n\nDuring the Umayyad and Abbasid periods, Shia Muslims in Lebanon faced persecution and marginalization. Many Shia Muslims were forced to practice their faith in secret, and their communities were often subject to raids and attacks. Despite these challenges, the Shia community in Lebanon continued to thrive, with many Shia scholars and theologians making significant contributions to Islamic thought and culture.\n\n## Mamluk period\n\nDuring the Mamluk period (1250-1517), Shia Muslims in Lebanon enjoyed a degree of tolerance and freedom. The Mamluk Sultanate, which ruled over much of the Middle East, including Lebanon, allowed Shia Muslims to practice their faith openly and even appointed Shia judges and officials to govern the region. This period saw a significant increase in Shia-Shia and Shia-Sunni interactions, leading to the development of a unique Lebanese Shia identity.\n\n## Under Ottoman rule\n\nLebanon came under Ottoman rule in 1517, and Shia Muslims in the region faced significant challenges. The Ottomans, who were Sunni Muslims, viewed Shia Muslims with suspicion and often persecuted them. Many Shia Muslims were forced to flee the region or practice their faith in secret.\n\n### Relations with Safavid Iran\n\nDuring the Ottoman period, Shia Muslims in Lebanon maintained close ties with Safavid Iran, which was a Shia empire that ruled over much of the Middle East. The Safavid Shahs provided financial and military support to Shia Muslims in Lebanon, helping them to maintain their distinct identity and resist Ottoman persecution.\n\n## French mandate period\n\nFollowing World War I, Lebanon came under French mandate, and Shia Muslims in the region faced new challenges. The French authorities attempted to impose their own brand of secularism on the region, which led to tensions with the Shia community. However, the French also introduced modern education and infrastructure, which helped to modernize the Shia community and promote social mobility.\n\n### Education\n\nDuring the French mandate period, Shia Muslims in Lebanon began to establish their own schools and educational institutions. These schools provided Shia children with access to modern education and helped to promote social mobility within the community.\n\n### Ja'fari shar'ia courts\n\nIn 1926, the French authorities recognized the Ja'fari shar'ia courts, which allowed Shia Muslims to govern their own personal status laws. This move helped to promote the autonomy of the Shia community and allowed them to maintain their distinct identity.\n\n# Sub-groups\n\n## Shia Twelvers (Metouali)\n\nThe Shia Twelvers, also known as Metouali, are the largest Shia sub-group in Lebanon. They believe in the authority of the twelve Imams, who are considered to be the rightful successors to the Prophet Muhammad.\n\n## Alawites\n\nThe Alawites are a small Shia sub-group in Lebanon, who believe in the divinity of Ali ibn Abi Talib, the cousin and son-in-law of the Prophet Muhammad. They have a distinct theology and practice, which is influenced by Gnosticism and other esoteric traditions.\n\n## Isma'ilis\n\nThe Isma'ilis are a small Shia sub-group in Lebanon, who believe in the authority of the Isma'ili Imams, who are considered to be the rightful successors to the Prophet Muhammad. They have a distinct theology and practice, which is influenced by Gnosticism and other esoteric traditions.\n\n# Geographic distribution within Lebanon\n\nShia Muslims are found throughout Lebanon, but they are concentrated in certain regions, such as the Bekaa Valley, the southern regions of the country, and the suburbs of Beirut.\n\n# Demographics\n\nShia Muslims make up approximately 30-35% of Lebanon's population, with the majority belonging to the Shia Twelver (Metouali) sect.\n\n# Genetics\n\nStudies have shown that Shia Muslims in Lebanon have a distinct genetic profile, which is influenced by their unique history and cultural practices.\n\n# Notable Lebanese Shia Muslims\n\n## Religious figures\n\n* Sayyid Musa al-Sadr, a prominent Shia cleric and politician who disappeared in 1978.\n* Sayyid Hassan Nasrallah, the current leader of Hezbollah.\n* Ayatollah Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah, a prominent Shia cleric and politician who died in 2010.\n\n## Political figures\n\n* Nabih Berri, the current Speaker of the Lebanese Parliament.\n* Imad Mughniyeh, a prominent Hezbollah military commander who was assassinated in 2008.\n* Abbas al-Mussawi, a prominent Hezbollah military commander who was assassinated in 1992.\n\n## Academics\n\n* Ali Shariati, a prominent Shia intellectual and sociologist who was born in Lebanon and educated in Paris.\n* Sayyid Hussein Tabatabai, a prominent Shia cleric and intellectual who was born in Lebanon and educated in Najaf.\n\n## Artists, singers and journalists\n\n* Fairouz, a prominent Lebanese singer and actress.\n* Wadih El Safi, a prominent Lebanese singer and composer.\n* Ghassan Kanafani, a prominent Palestinian writer and journalist who was born in Lebanon.\n\n# See also\n\n* Shia Islam\n* Hezbollah\n* Lebanon\n* Middle East\n\n# References\n\n# External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Lebanese_Shia_Muslims\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Origins\n##Early Islamic period\n##Mamluk period\n##Under Ottoman rule\n###Relations with Safavid Iran\n##French mandate period\n###Education\n###Ja'fari shar'ia courts\n#Sub-groups\n##Shia Twelvers (Metouali)\n##Alawites\n##Isma'ilis\n#Geographic distribution within Lebanon\n#Demographics\n#Genetics\n#Notable Lebanese Shia Muslims\n##Religious figures\n##Political figures\n##Academics\n##Artists, singers and journalists\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He is considered one of the most important figures in Afghan history, known for his efforts to modernize and unify the country. During his reign, he had to navigate the complex web of European influence in the region, fight wars with neighboring countries, and balance the interests of various factions within Afghanistan.\n\nBackground and rise to power\n---------------------------\n\nDost Mohammad Khan was born in 1793 in Kandahar, Afghanistan. He was a member of the Barakzai tribe, which was a powerful and influential tribe in Afghanistan. His father, Painda Khan, was a prominent leader of the tribe and had played a key role in the Afghan Empire under Ahmad Shah Durrani. Dost Mohammad Khan's early life was marked by turmoil and conflict, as his family and tribe were embroiled in the power struggles of the Afghan Empire.\n\nIn 1823, Dost Mohammad Khan seized power in Kabul and declared himself the Emir of Afghanistan. He was able to consolidate his power and establish a stable government, which was a significant achievement in a country that had been plagued by instability and conflict for decades. During his early years in power, Dost Mohammad Khan focused on modernizing the country's infrastructure, including the construction of roads, bridges, and canals.\n\nEuropean influence in Afghanistan\n---------------------------------\n\nDuring Dost Mohammad Khan's reign, Afghanistan became increasingly entangled in the complex web of European influence in the region. The British Empire, in particular, was expanding its influence in India and Central Asia, and Afghanistan was seen as a key strategic location. The British were concerned about the potential for Russian expansion in the region and saw Afghanistan as a buffer state that could help to protect their interests.\n\nDost Mohammad Khan was aware of the European influence in the region and sought to navigate it carefully. He established diplomatic relations with the British and received British envoys in Kabul. However, he was also wary of British intentions and sought to maintain Afghanistan's independence and sovereignty.\n\nWar with the Sikhs\n-----------------\n\nIn 1834, Dost Mohammad Khan launched a war against the Sikh Empire, which was a powerful and expanding state in the region. The war was sparked by a dispute over the city of Peshawar, which was a key strategic location in the region. The war was fought on several fronts, and the Afghans were ultimately able to defeat the Sikhs and capture Peshawar.\n\nHowever, the war had significant consequences for Dost Mohammad Khan and Afghanistan. The British, who had been watching the war with interest, saw an opportunity to expand their influence in the region. They launched the First Anglo-Afghan War in 1839, which resulted in the overthrow of Dost Mohammad Khan and the occupation of Kabul by British forces.\n\nSecond reign\n------------\n\nDost Mohammad Khan was restored to power in 1842, after the British withdrew from Afghanistan following the disastrous First Anglo-Afghan War. He was determined to rebuild and strengthen his country, and he launched a series of modernizing reforms. He also sought to balance the interests of the various factions within Afghanistan, including the powerful tribal leaders and the ulama.\n\n### Conquest of the Balkh Wilayat\n\nIn 1850, Dost Mohammad Khan launched a campaign to conquer the Balkh Wilayat, a region in northern Afghanistan that was controlled by the Uzbek khanates. The campaign was successful, and the Afghans were able to capture the city of Balkh and incorporate the region into the Afghan Empire.\n\n### Alliance with the British\n\nIn 1855, Dost Mohammad Khan signed a treaty with the British, which established a formal alliance between the two countries. The treaty provided for British support for Afghanistan in the event of an attack by a third country, and it also provided for trade agreements and other forms of cooperation.\n\n### Conquest of Herat and Death\n\nIn 1862, Dost Mohammad Khan launched a campaign to conquer the city of Herat, which was a key strategic location in western Afghanistan. The campaign was successful, and the Afghans were able to capture the city and incorporate it into the Afghan Empire.\n\nDost Mohammad Khan died in 1863, after a long and eventful reign. He was succeeded by his son, Sher Ali Khan, who went on to become a prominent leader in his own right.\n\nGallery\n--------\n\n* Dost Mohammad Khan\n* The Bala Hissar fortress in Kabul\n* The city of Peshawar\n* The Balkh Wilayat region\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Afghan Empire\n* Anglo-Afghan Wars\n* Barakzai dynasty\n* History of Afghanistan\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n### Sources\n\n* Fayz Muhammad Katib Hazarah's Siraj al-tawarikh\n* Muhammad Hayat Khan's Hayat-i Afghan\n* The Cambridge History of Afghanistan\n* The Oxford Handbook of the History of Afghanistan\n\nExternal links\n---------------\n\n* Afghanistan Online\n* The British Library's collection of Afghan manuscripts\n* The Metropolitan Museum of Art's collection of Afghan art and artifacts", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Dost_Mohammad_Khan\" following this outline:\n\n#Background and rise to power\n#European influence in Afghanistan\n#War with the Sikhs\n#Second reign\n##Conquest of the Balkh Wilayat\n##Alliance with the British\n##Conquest of Herat and Death\n#Gallery\n#See also\n#References\n##Sources\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The storm developed in the Atlantic Ocean, intensifying into a hurricane before making landfall in the Bahamas and later in Florida. Nicole was the 14th named storm and the 8th hurricane of the 2022 Atlantic hurricane season.\n\n#Meteorological history\n\nHurricane Nicole originated from a tropical wave that emerged off the coast of Africa on October 27, 2022. The wave moved westward across the Atlantic, developing a low-pressure system on November 1. The system gradually organized, and the National Hurricane Center (NHC) designated it as Tropical Depression Sixteen on November 4. The depression intensified into Tropical Storm Nicole on November 5, and further strengthened into a hurricane on November 7.\n\nNicole's intensification was fueled by favorable environmental conditions, including warm ocean waters and low wind shear. The storm reached its peak intensity as a Category 1 hurricane on November 9, with sustained winds of 75 mph (120 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 984 mbar. Nicole maintained this intensity as it approached the Bahamas, making landfall on November 10.\n\n#Preparations\n\n##Bahamas\n\nThe Bahamian government issued a hurricane warning for the entire country, and residents were advised to evacuate low-lying areas. The Royal Bahamas Defence Force and the Bahamas National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) were activated to provide assistance and emergency services. Schools and government offices were closed, and flights were suspended.\n\n##United States\n\n###Florida\n\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency for 34 counties, and the Florida National Guard was activated to assist with evacuations and relief efforts. Mandatory evacuations were ordered for several counties, including Volusia, Flagler, and Brevard. Residents were advised to stock up on supplies, including food, water, and batteries.\n\nThe city of Miami issued a tropical storm warning, and the Miami-Dade County Emergency Management department activated its emergency operations center. The Miami Beach Police Department and the Miami-Dade Police Department increased patrols to monitor the situation.\n\n###Neighboring states\n\nGeorgia Governor Brian Kemp declared a state of emergency for several counties, and the Georgia National Guard was activated to assist with evacuations and relief efforts. The South Carolina Emergency Management Division activated its emergency operations center, and residents were advised to prepare for potential flooding and power outages.\n\n#Impact\n\n##Lesser Antilles\n\nNicole brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to the Lesser Antilles, causing widespread damage and power outages. The islands of Barbados, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines were severely affected, with reports of flooding and landslides.\n\n##Greater Antilles\n\nNicole's outer rain bands brought heavy rainfall to Puerto Rico, causing flash flooding and mudslides. The Dominican Republic and Haiti also experienced heavy rainfall and strong winds, with reports of damage and power outages.\n\n##Bahamas\n\nNicole made landfall in the Bahamas on November 10, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall. The storm caused widespread damage and flooding, particularly on the islands of Grand Bahama and Abaco. The Bahamian government reported that several homes were destroyed, and thousands of residents were left without power.\n\n##United States\n\n###Florida\n\nNicole made landfall in Florida on November 10, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall. The storm caused widespread damage and flooding, particularly in the eastern part of the state. The cities of Daytona Beach, Flagler Beach, and St. Augustine were severely affected, with reports of flooding and power outages.\n\nThe storm also caused significant damage to the state's agriculture, with reports of crop losses and damage to citrus groves. The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services estimated that the storm caused over $100 million in damages to the state's agriculture.\n\n###Elsewhere\n\nNicole brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to other parts of the southeastern United States, including Georgia and South Carolina. The storm caused widespread power outages and flooding, particularly in the coastal regions.\n\n##Canada\n\nNicole brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to the Canadian Maritimes, particularly in the provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.

Born on June 24, 1987, in Rosario, Argentina, Messi began playing football at a young age and quickly rose to prominence as a skilled and prolific goal-scorer. Throughout his career, he has played for Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain, and Inter Miami, while also representing the Argentina national team.\n\n#Early life\n\nLionel Messi was born in Rosario, Argentina, to Jorge Messi, a steel factory worker, and Celia Cuccittini, a part-time cleaner. He grew up in a family of Italian and Spanish descent, and was the third of four children. Messi's early life was marked by a passion for football, which he inherited from his father and maternal grandfather. He began playing football at the age of five, joining the local club Grandoli, where his father coached.\n\n#Youth career\n\n##Newell's Old Boys (1995–2000)\n\nMessi joined Newell's Old Boys, a local club in Rosario, at the age of eight. He quickly established himself as a talented young player, scoring over 100 goals for the club's youth teams. Messi's exceptional skill and speed earned him the nickname \"La Pulga\" (The Flea), which would stick with him throughout his career.\n\n##Barcelona (2000–2004)\n\nIn 2000, Messi joined FC Barcelona's youth academy, La Masia, at the age of 13. Barcelona had been scouting Messi for several years and eventually offered him a contract, which included the cost of treatment for a growth hormone deficiency that Messi had been diagnosed with. At La Masia, Messi trained alongside other talented young players, including Xavi, Andrés Iniesta, and Gerard Piqué.\n\n#Club career\n\n##Barcelona (2004–2021)\n\n###2004–2008: Rise to the first team\n\nMessi made his professional debut for Barcelona in 2004, at the age of 17.

Messi made his debut for Inter Miami in 2023, scoring his first goal for the club in July.\n\n#International career\n\nMessi made his international debut for Argentina in 2005, at the age of 18. He quickly established himself as a key player for the team, helping Argentina win the Olympic gold medal in 2008. Messi has since played for Argentina in several international tournaments, including the World Cup and the Copa América.\n\n#Player profile\n\n##Style of play\n\nMessi is known for his exceptional dribbling skills, speed, and vision on the pitch. He is a versatile player who can play in a variety of positions, including winger, attacking midfielder, and forward. Messi is also known for his exceptional goal-scoring ability, with over 770 goals scored throughout his career.\n\n##Tactical positioning\n\nMessi is often deployed as a left winger or attacking midfielder, where he can use his speed and agility to beat defenders and create scoring opportunities. He is also comfortable playing as a central attacking midfielder, where he can use his vision and passing ability to control the tempo of the game.\n\n#Reception\n\n##Comparisons with Cristiano Ronaldo\n\nMessi and Cristiano Ronaldo are often compared and contrasted, with many regarding them as the two greatest players of their generation.

They were the key architects of the American Revolution, the Declaration of Independence, and the United States Constitution. These individuals, who came from diverse backgrounds and had different perspectives, shared a common goal of creating a new nation based on democratic principles, individual rights, and the rule of law.\n\n# Historical founders\n\nThe term \"Founding Fathers\" is often used to describe a group of individuals who were instrumental in the creation of the United States. However, the concept of a \"founding father\" has been the subject of much debate and interpretation. Some historians argue that the term should only be applied to those who played a direct role in the drafting and signing of the Declaration of Independence and the United States Constitution. Others argue that the term should be broadened to include those who made significant contributions to the American Revolution and the early years of the United States.\n\n# Origin of phrase\n\nThe term \"Founding Fathers\" was first used in 1916 by Warren G. Harding, who would later become the 29th President of the United States. Harding used the term to describe the individuals who had played a crucial role in the creation of the United States. However, the term gained widespread acceptance during the 1930s, when it was used by historians and politicians to describe the individuals who had signed the Declaration of Independence and the United States Constitution.\n\n# List of Founding Fathers\n\n## Framers and signers\n\nThe following individuals were instrumental in the drafting and signing of the Declaration of Independence and the United States Constitution:\n\n* John Adams (Massachusetts)\n* Samuel Adams (Massachusetts)\n* Josiah Bartlett (New Hampshire)\n* Carter Braxton (Virginia)\n* Charles Carroll (Maryland)\n* George Clymer (Pennsylvania)\n* William Ellery (Rhode Island)\n* William Floyd (New York)\n* Benjamin Franklin (Pennsylvania)\n* Elbridge Gerry (Massachusetts)\n* Button Gwinnett (Georgia)\n* Lyman Hall (Georgia)\n* John Hancock (Massachusetts)\n* Benjamin Harrison (Virginia)\n* John Hart (New Jersey)\n* Joseph Hewes (North Carolina)\n* Thomas Heyward Jr. (South Carolina)\n* William Hooper (North Carolina)\n* Stephen Hopkins (Rhode Island)\n* Francis Hopkinson (New Jersey)\n* Samual Huntington (Connecticut)\n* Thomas Jefferson (Virginia)\n* Richard Henry Lee (Virginia)\n* John Morton (Pennsylvania)\n* Thomas Nelson Jr. (Virginia)\n* William Paca (Maryland)\n* Robert Treat Paine (Massachusetts)\n* John Penn (North Carolina)\n* George Read (Delaware)\n* Caesar Rodney (Delaware)\n* George Ross (Pennsylvania)\n* Edward Rutledge (South Carolina)\n* Roger Sherman (Connecticut)\n* James Smith (Pennsylvania)\n* Richard Stockton (New Jersey)\n* Thomas Stone (Maryland)\n* George Taylor (Pennsylvania)\n* Matthew Thornton (New Hampshire)\n* George Walton (Georgia)\n* William Whipple (New Hampshire)\n* John Witherspoon (New Jersey)\n* Oliver Wolcott (Connecticut)\n* George Wythe (Virginia)\n\n### Other delegates\n\nThe following individuals played important roles in the drafting and signing of the Declaration of Independence and the United States Constitution, but did not sign the documents:\n\n* John Dickinson (Pennsylvania)\n* Charles Pinckney (South Carolina)\n* George Mason (Virginia)\n* James Madison (Virginia)\n* Alexander Hamilton (New York)\n* John Jay (New York)\n\n## Additional Founding Fathers\n\nThe following individuals made significant contributions to the American Revolution and the early years of the United States, but did not sign the Declaration of Independence or the United States Constitution:\n\n* Patrick Henry (Virginia)\n* Thomas Paine (Pennsylvania)\n* Paul Revere (Massachusetts)\n* John Paul Jones (Virginia)\n* Nathanael Greene (Rhode Island)\n* Henry Knox (Massachusetts)\n* Horatio Gates (Virginia)\n* Anthony Wayne (Pennsylvania)\n* Benedict Arnold (Connecticut)\n\n## Women founders\n\nThe following women played important roles in the American Revolution and the early years of the United States:\n\n* Abigail Adams (Massachusetts)\n* Dolley Madison (Virginia)\n* Martha Washington (Virginia)\n* Esther Reed (Pennsylvania)\n* Deborah Sampson (Massachusetts)\n* Phyllis Wheatley (Massachusetts)\n\n## Other patriots\n\nThe following individuals made significant contributions to the American Revolution and the early years of the United States, but did not sign the Declaration of Independence or the United States Constitution:\n\n* Crispus Attucks (Massachusetts)\n* Haym Salomon (New York)\n* Francis Marion (South Carolina)\n* Daniel Shays (Massachusetts)\n* George Mason (Virginia)\n* Richard Henry Lee (Virginia)\n\n# The colonies unite (1765–1774)\n\nThe American colonies began to unite in the mid-1760s, in response to British taxation policies.
