The goal of mitigation is to limit the extent of climate change and its impacts on the environment, human health, and the economy.\n\n# Definitions and scope\n\nClimate change mitigation involves a range of activities and strategies aimed at reducing the amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere, as well as removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. These efforts can be implemented at various levels, from individual actions to national and international policies.\n\n## Relationship with solar radiation modification (SRM)\n\nSolar radiation modification (SRM) is a proposed method of mitigating climate change by reducing the amount of solar radiation that enters the Earth's atmosphere. However, SRM is not considered a substitute for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, as it does not address the root cause of climate change. Instead, SRM is seen as a potential complement to emission reduction efforts, and its development and deployment are still in the early stages.\n\n# Emission trends and pledges\n\n## Needed emissions cuts\n\nTo limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that global greenhouse gas emissions need to be reduced by 45% by 2030 and reach net-zero by 2050. This requires significant reductions in emissions from all sectors, including energy, industry, and agriculture.\n\n## Pledges\n\nCountries have made various pledges to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, including Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement. However, the current pace of emission reductions is not sufficient to meet the 1.5°C target, and more ambitious action is needed.\n\n# Low-carbon energy\n\n## Solar and wind energy\n\nSolar and wind energy are among the fastest-growing sources of low-carbon energy. The cost of solar and wind energy has decreased dramatically in recent years, making them more competitive with fossil fuels.

The grade is a subjective assessment of the climb's technical difficulty, physical demands, and level of risk. Climbing grades are used to communicate the level of challenge and danger involved in a particular climb, allowing climbers to choose routes that match their skills and experience.\n\nHistory\n\nThe concept of climbing grades dates back to the late 19th century, when mountaineers began to develop systems to classify the difficulty of mountain climbs. One of the earliest grading systems was developed by the Swiss Alpine Club in 1890, which used a simple system of Roman numerals to classify climbs from I (easy) to VI (extremely difficult). Over time, various countries and climbing organizations developed their own grading systems, leading to the diversity of systems in use today.\n\nFree climbing\n\nFree climbing involves ascending a rock wall or other surface using only one's hands, feet, and other body parts, without the use of artificial aids. Free climbing grades are used to measure the technical difficulty of a climb, taking into account factors such as the steepness of the terrain, the size and quality of handholds and footholds, and the level of physical exertion required.\n\n### French numerical grade\n\nThe French numerical grade is one of the most widely used grading systems for free climbing. Developed in the 1960s, the system uses a scale of numbers from 1 (easy) to 9 (extremely difficult). The grade is based on the most difficult move or sequence of moves on the climb, and takes into account factors such as the steepness of the terrain, the size and quality of handholds and footholds, and the level of physical exertion required.\n\n### American YDS grade\n\nThe American YDS (Yosemite Decimal System) grade is another widely used grading system for free climbing. Developed in the 1950s, the system uses a scale of numbers from Class 1 (easy) to Class 5 (extremely difficult). The grade is based on the most difficult move or sequence of moves on the climb, and takes into account factors such as the steepness of the terrain, the size and quality of handholds and footholds, and the level of physical exertion required.\n\n### UIAA scale\n\nThe UIAA (Union of International Alpine Associations) scale is a grading system used for free climbing in Europe and other parts of the world. Developed in the 1970s, the system uses a scale of Roman numerals from I (easy) to XII (extremely difficult). The grade is based on the most difficult move or sequence of moves on the climb, and takes into account factors such as the steepness of the terrain, the size and quality of handholds and footholds, and the level of physical exertion required.\n\n### British E-grade\n\nThe British E-grade system is used for free climbing in the United Kingdom and other parts of the world. Developed in the 1970s, the system uses a scale of letters from E1 (easy) to E9 (extremely difficult). The grade is based on the most difficult move or sequence of moves on the climb, and takes into account factors such as the steepness of the terrain, the size and quality of handholds and footholds, and the level of physical exertion required.\n\n### Other notable systems\n\nOther notable grading systems for free climbing include the Australian Ewbank system, the New Zealand grade, and the South African grade.\n\nBouldering\n\nBouldering involves ascending short, lower-level rock formations or artificial walls without the use of ropes or harnesses. Bouldering grades are used to measure the technical difficulty of a climb, taking into account factors such as the steepness of the terrain, the size and quality of handholds and footholds, and the level of physical exertion required.\n\n### Comparison with free climbing\n\nBouldering grades are generally considered to be higher than free climbing grades, due to the increased physical demands and level of risk involved in bouldering. However, the grading systems used for bouldering are not always directly comparable to those used for free climbing.\n\n### Font grade\n\nThe Font grade is a grading system used for bouldering in Europe and other parts of the world. Developed in the 1980s, the system uses a scale of numbers from 3 (easy) to 8C (extremely difficult). The grade is based on the most difficult move or sequence of moves on the climb, and takes into account factors such as the steepness of the terrain, the size and quality of handholds and footholds, and the level of physical exertion required.\n\n### V-grade\n\nThe V-grade system is a grading system used for bouldering in the United States and other parts of the world. Developed in the 1990s, the system uses a scale of numbers from V0 (easy) to V16 (extremely difficult). The grade is based on the most difficult move or sequence of moves on the climb, and takes into account factors such as the steepness of the terrain, the size and quality of handholds and footholds, and the level of physical exertion required.\n\n### Other notable systems\n\nOther notable grading systems for bouldering include the British V-grade system and the Australian V-grade system.\n\nAid climbing\n\nAid climbing involves ascending a rock wall or other surface using artificial aids such as ladders, hooks, and cams. Aid climbing grades are used to measure the technical difficulty of a climb, taking into account factors such as the steepness of the terrain, the size and quality of handholds and footholds, and the level of physical exertion required.\n\n### Instability of aid grades\n\nAid climbing grades are generally considered to be less stable than free climbing grades, due to the increased variability in the difficulty of aid climbing routes. This is because aid climbing routes often involve a high degree of technical complexity, and the difficulty of the route can vary significantly depending on the specific aids used.\n\n### Original A-grade\n\nThe original A-grade system was developed in the 1960s and used a scale of numbers from A0 (easy) to A5 (extremely difficult). The grade was based on the most difficult move or sequence of moves on the climb, and took into account factors such as the steepness of the terrain, the size and quality of handholds and footholds, and the level of physical exertion required.\n\n### New wave A-grade\n\nThe new wave A-grade system was developed in the 1980s and uses a scale of numbers from A0 (easy) to A6 (extremely difficult). The grade is based on the most difficult move or sequence of moves on the climb, and takes into account factors such as the steepness of the terrain, the size and quality of handholds and footholds, and the level of physical exertion required.\n\n### Clean C-grade\n\nThe clean C-grade system is a grading system used for aid climbing in the United States and other parts of the world. Developed in the 1990s, the system uses a scale of numbers from C0 (easy) to C5 (extremely difficult). The grade is based on the most difficult move or sequence of moves on the climb, and takes into account factors such as the steepness of the terrain, the size and quality of handholds and footholds, and the level of physical exertion required.\n\nIce and mixed climbing\n\nIce and mixed climbing involves ascending ice formations or mixed rock and ice formations using specialized equipment such as crampons and ice axes. Ice and mixed climbing grades are used to measure the technical difficulty of a climb, taking into account factors such as the steepness of the terrain, the size and quality of handholds and footholds, and the level of physical exertion required.\n\n### WI-grade\n\nThe WI-grade system is a grading system used for ice climbing in the United States and other parts of the world. Developed in the 1970s, the system uses a scale of numbers from WI1 (easy) to WI7 (extremely difficult). The grade is based on the most difficult move or sequence of moves on the climb, and takes into account factors such as the steepness of the terrain, the size and quality of handholds and footholds, and the level of physical exertion required.\n\n### M-grade\n\nThe M-grade system is a grading system used for mixed climbing in the United States and other parts of the world. Developed in the 1990s, the system uses a scale of numbers from M1 (easy) to M14 (extremely difficult). The grade is based on the most difficult move or sequence of moves on the climb, and takes into account factors such as the steepness of the terrain, the size and quality of handholds and footholds, and the level of physical exertion required.\n\n### D-grade\n\nThe D-grade system is a grading system used for ice and mixed climbing in Europe and other parts of the world. Developed in the 1980s, the system uses a scale of numbers from D1 (easy) to D7 (extremely difficult). The grade is based on the most difficult move or sequence of moves on the climb, and takes into account factors such as the steepness of the terrain, the size and quality of handholds and footholds, and the level of physical exertion required.\n\n### Scottish winter grade\n\nThe Scottish winter grade system is a grading system used for ice and mixed climbing in Scotland and other parts of the world. Developed in the 1980s, the system uses a scale of numbers from I (easy) to XII (extremely difficult). The grade is based on the most difficult move or sequence of moves on the climb, and takes into account factors such as the steepness of the terrain, the size and quality of handholds and footholds, and the level of physical exertion required.\n\n### Other notable systems\n\nOther notable grading systems for ice and mixed climbing include the Canadian ice grade system and the French ice grade system.\n\nMountaineering\n\nMountaineering involves ascending mountains using a variety of techniques, including hiking, rock climbing, and ice climbing. Mountaineering grades are used to measure the technical difficulty of a climb, taking into account factors such as the steepness of the terrain, the size and quality of handholds and footholds, and the level of physical exertion required.\n\n### International French Adjectival System\n\nThe International French Adjectival System is a grading system used for mountaineering in Europe and other parts of the world. Developed in the 1970s, the system uses a scale of adjectives from F (easy) to ED (extremely difficult).

As a proponent of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, Krefft was a key figure in the Darwinian controversy in Australia, and his work had a lasting impact on the country's scientific community.\n\n# Family\n\nGerard Krefft was born on February 7, 1830, in Brunswig, Germany, to a family of modest means. His father was a tailor, and the family lived a simple life. Krefft's early education was at a local school, where he developed a strong interest in natural history.\n\n## Education\n\nKrefft's formal education was limited, but he was an avid learner and developed a passion for natural history through self-study and observation. He spent many hours exploring the countryside, collecting specimens, and reading books on natural history.\n\n## Marriage\n\nIn 1852, Krefft married a woman named Anna, and the couple had several children together. The marriage was happy, but Anna's health was fragile, and she died in 1865.\n\n## German heritage\n\nKrefft's German heritage had a significant impact on his life and work. He was proud of his German roots and maintained strong connections with his homeland throughout his life. Krefft's love of natural history was also influenced by the German tradition of Naturphilosophie, which emphasized the importance of observing and understanding the natural world.\n\n# \"Natural history\"\n\nKrefft's interest in natural history was sparked at an early age, and he spent many years developing his knowledge and skills in this field. He was particularly interested in botany, zoology, and geology, and he spent many hours collecting specimens and studying the natural world.\n\n## \"Darwinian doctrine\" and the consequent \"Darwinian controversy\"\n\nIn 1859, Charles Darwin's book \"On the Origin of Species\" was published, and it caused a sensation in the scientific community. Krefft was one of the first scientists in Australia to support Darwin's theory of evolution, and he became a key figure in the Darwinian controversy in Australia.\n\n## Evolution\n\nKrefft's support for evolution was based on his own observations and studies of the natural world. He believed that the diversity of life on Earth could be explained by the process of evolution, and he saw the fossil record as evidence of this process.\n\n## Natural selection\n\nKrefft was also a strong supporter of natural selection, the mechanism by which evolution occurs. He believed that natural selection was the key to understanding the diversity of life on Earth, and he saw it as a fundamental principle of biology.\n\n## Ellegård's five \"positions\" held by scientists in the Darwinian controversy\n\nIn 1958, Alvar Ellegård identified five positions held by scientists in the Darwinian controversy: (1) opposition to evolution, (2) acceptance of evolution but rejection of natural selection, (3) acceptance of evolution and natural selection but rejection of gradualism, (4) acceptance of evolution, natural selection, and gradualism, and (5) acceptance of evolution, natural selection, and gradualism, but with reservations. Krefft held the fourth position.\n\n# Artist\n\nKrefft was a talented artist, and he used his skills to illustrate his scientific papers and books. He was particularly skilled at drawing and painting animals, and his illustrations are still admired today.\n\n# Victoria (1852 – 1858)\n\nIn 1852, Krefft emigrated to Australia and settled in Victoria. He worked as a natural history collector and artist, and he became known for his expertise on the fauna of Victoria.\n\n## Melbourne\n\nKrefft lived in Melbourne, the capital of Victoria, and he became a prominent figure in the city's scientific community. He was a member of the Melbourne Club, a prestigious gentlemen's club, and he was also a member of the Victorian Institute for the Advancement of Science.\n\n## Blandowski, the Museum of Natural History, and Professor McCoy\n\nIn 1854, Krefft met William Blandowski, a German-born naturalist who was working at the Museum of Natural History in Melbourne. Blandowski introduced Krefft to Professor Frederick McCoy, the curator of the museum, and Krefft began to work at the museum as a collector and artist.\n\n# Germany\n\nIn 1858, Krefft returned to Germany, where he worked as a natural history collector and artist. He spent several years in Germany, during which time he developed his skills as a naturalist and artist.\n\n# Natural historian, museum curator and administrator\n\nIn 1860, Krefft returned to Australia and became the curator of the Australian Museum in Sydney. He worked at the museum for 12 years, during which time he developed the museum's collections and established it as a major center for natural history research.\n\n## Darwinism\n\nKrefft was a strong supporter of Darwinism, and he saw the Australian Museum as a place where he could promote the theory of evolution. He gave public lectures on Darwinism, and he also wrote articles and books on the subject.\n\n## \"The New Museum Idea\"\n\nIn the 1860s, Krefft developed a new idea for museums, which he called \"The New Museum Idea.\" This idea emphasized the importance of making museums accessible to the general public, and it also emphasized the importance of displaying specimens in a way that was attractive and educational.\n\n## Cabinets of curiosities\n\nKrefft was critical of the traditional cabinets of curiosities, which he saw as dusty and out of date. He believed that museums should be modern and dynamic, and he saw the Australian Museum as a place where he could put his ideas into practice.\n\n## Public museums\n\nKrefft believed that museums should be public institutions, and he saw the Australian Museum as a place where the general public could come to learn about natural history. He developed a range of programs and exhibitions that were designed to attract a broad audience.\n\n## The \"new museum\"\n\nKrefft's \"new museum\" was a place where science and art came together. He believed that museums should be beautiful and inspiring, and he saw the Australian Museum as a place where he could create a new kind of museum experience.\n\n## Krefft's curatorial rationale\n\nKrefft's curatorial rationale was based on his belief in the importance of education and accessibility. He believed that museums should be places where people could come to learn and be inspired, and he saw the Australian Museum as a place where he could put his ideas into practice.\n\n## Lack of funding\n\nDespite Krefft's best efforts, the Australian Museum was chronically underfunded, and he struggled to develop the museum's collections and programs. He was constantly seeking funding and support, but he often faced opposition from the museum's trustees and the government.\n\n# Photography\n\nKrefft was an early adopter of photography, and he saw it as a way to document and promote the natural world. He took many photographs of specimens and landscapes, and he also used photography to illustrate his scientific papers and books.\n\n# Queensland lungfish (Neoceratodus forsteri)\n\nIn 1870, Krefft discovered the Queensland lungfish (Neoceratodus forsteri), a species of fish that was thought to be extinct. Krefft's discovery was a major scientific breakthrough, and it helped to establish him as a leading figure in Australian science.\n\n## Louis Agassiz and the Chimaera\n\nKrefft's discovery of the Queensland lungfish was influenced by the work of Louis Agassiz, a Swiss-born naturalist who had written about the Chimaera, a mythical creature that was said to have the head of a lion, the body of a goat, and the tail of a serpent. Krefft saw the Queensland lungfish as a real-life example of the Chimaera, and he was fascinated by its unique characteristics.\n\n## Gerard Krefft, William Forster, and the cartilaginous Burnett Salmon or barramunda\n\nKrefft's discovery of the Queensland lungfish was also influenced by his work with William Forster, a politician and naturalist who had collected specimens of the Burnett Salmon or barramunda, a species of fish that was found in the Burnett River in Queensland. Krefft saw the Burnett Salmon as a related species to the Queensland lungfish, and he was interested in studying its characteristics.\n\n## January 1870\n\nIn January 1870, Krefft published a paper on the Queensland lungfish, which he called \"Description of a gigantic fish from Queensland.\" The paper was a major scientific breakthrough, and it helped to establish Krefft as a leading figure in Australian science.\n\n# Krefft's \"Natural History\" articles in The Sydney Mail\n\nIn the 1870s, Krefft wrote a series of articles on natural history for The Sydney Mail, a newspaper that was published in Sydney. The articles were popular and well-received, and they helped to establish Krefft as a leading figure in Australian science.\n\n## George B. Mason and The Australian Home Companion and Band of Hope Journal\n\nKrefft's articles in The Sydney Mail were influenced by his work with George B. Mason, a journalist and naturalist who had written for The Australian Home Companion and Band of Hope Journal, a newspaper that was published in Sydney. Mason had written about natural history, and Krefft saw him as a mentor and a model.\n\n## Krefft and The Sydney Mail\n\nKrefft's articles in The Sydney Mail were popular and well-received, and they helped to establish him as a leading figure in Australian science. He wrote about a range of topics, including botany, zoology, and geology, and he used his articles to promote his ideas about natural history.\n\n## Krefft's Enterprise\n\nIn 1873, Krefft founded a company called Krefft's Enterprise, which was designed to promote his ideas about natural history and to sell his articles and books. The company was successful, and it helped to establish Krefft as a leading figure in Australian science.\n\n## Charles Darwin (naturalist)\n\nKrefft's articles in The Sydney Mail were also influenced by his work with Charles Darwin, a British naturalist who had written about evolution and natural history. Krefft saw Darwin as a mentor and a model, and he was influenced by his ideas about evolution and natural selection.\n\n## Support of Darwin, Darwinism, and Natural Selection\n\nKrefft was a strong supporter of Darwin, Darwinism, and natural selection, and he used his articles in The Sydney Mail to promote these ideas. He saw natural history as a way to understand the natural world, and he believed that evolution and natural selection were key to this understanding.\n\n## July 1873\n\nIn July 1873, Krefft published an article in The Sydney Mail called \"Remarks on New Creations,\" which was a critique of the idea of special creation. The article was a major scientific breakthrough, and it helped to establish Krefft as a leading figure in Australian science.\n\n### \"Remarks on New Creations\"\n\nKrefft's article \"Remarks on New Creations\" was a critique of the idea of special creation, which was the idea that God had created each species separately. Krefft argued that this idea was not supported by scientific evidence, and he used his article to promote his ideas about evolution and natural selection.\n\n### \"Remarks on New Hypotheses\"\n\nIn 1873, Krefft also published an article in The Sydney Mail called \"Remarks on New Hypotheses,\" which was a critique of new ideas about natural history. The article was a major scientific breakthrough, and it helped to establish Krefft as a leading figure in Australian science.\n\n## Post-dismissal\n\nAfter Krefft's dismissal from the Australian Museum, he continued to write and publish articles on natural history. He was a prolific writer, and he published many articles and books on a range of topics.\n\n# Dismissal from office\n\nIn 1874, Krefft was dismissed from his position as curator of the Australian Museum. The dismissal was a major scandal, and it was widely reported in the press.\n\n## Gold theft and its aftermath\n\nKrefft's dismissal was the result of a scandal involving the theft of gold from the museum's collections. Krefft was accused of being involved in the theft, and he was dismissed from his position.\n\n## Museum closure\n\nAfter Krefft's dismissal, the Australian Museum was closed, and it remained closed for several years. The closure was a major blow to the scientific community, and it had a lasting impact on the development of natural history in Australia.\n\n## Eviction from his residential quarters\n\nKrefft was also evicted from his residential quarters at the museum, and he was forced to find new accommodation.\n\n## Trustee's allegations\n\nThe trustees of the museum made several allegations against Krefft, including allegations of misconduct and incompetence.

The test flight was conducted on April 20, 2023, marking a significant milestone in the development of the Starship program.\n\n# Background\n\n## Starship\n\nStarship is a next-generation reusable spacecraft designed for long-duration missions to the Moon, Mars, and other destinations in the solar system. The spacecraft is capable of carrying both crew and cargo, and is intended to play a critical role in establishing a permanent human presence on the Moon and Mars. Starship is powered by six Raptor engines, which provide a combined thrust of 17 million pounds-force (76 meganewtons) at liftoff.\n\n## Development\n\nThe development of Starship began in 2016, with the goal of creating a spacecraft capable of transporting humans to the Moon and Mars. Over the years, SpaceX has made significant progress in the development of the spacecraft, including the construction of multiple prototypes and the successful testing of the Raptor engine. In 2020, SpaceX conducted a series of successful tests of the Starship's propulsion system, including a 500-foot (152 meters) hop test.\n\n## Opinions before launch\n\nPrior to the launch of the Starship Flight Test 1, opinions on the test's success were mixed. Some experts expressed concerns about the spacecraft's ability to survive the intense heat generated during re-entry, while others questioned the test's ambitious objectives. Elon Musk, however, remained optimistic about the test's prospects, stating that the flight would be a major step towards establishing a permanent human presence on Mars.\n\n## Test objectives\n\nThe primary objectives of the Starship Flight Test 1 were to test the spacecraft's propulsion system, navigation and control systems, and to demonstrate the spacecraft's ability to survive the intense heat generated during re-entry. The test also aimed to evaluate the spacecraft's performance during ascent and descent, and to gather data on the spacecraft's aerodynamics and thermal protection systems.\n\n# Launch\n\n## Flight profile\n\nThe Starship Flight Test 1 followed a complex flight profile, which included a vertical takeoff, a ascent to an altitude of approximately 26 kilometers (16 miles), and a re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere. The spacecraft then splashed down in the Gulf of Mexico, approximately 30 kilometers (19 miles) off the coast of Brownsville, Texas.\n\n## Flight timeline\n\nThe Starship Flight Test 1 was originally scheduled to launch on April 17, 2023, but was delayed due to technical issues. The test was eventually conducted on April 20, 2023, at 8:33 AM CDT (13:33 UTC).\n\n## April 17, 2023 attempt\n\nOn April 17, 2023, SpaceX attempted to launch the Starship Flight Test 1, but the test was scrubbed due to technical issues. The exact nature of the issues was not disclosed, but Elon Musk stated that the test was delayed to ensure the spacecraft's safety.\n\n## April 20, 2023, 2nd attempt\n\nOn April 20, 2023, SpaceX successfully launched the Starship Flight Test 1. The test was conducted without any major issues, and the spacecraft performed as expected. The test marked a significant milestone in the development of the Starship program.\n\n# Aftermath\n\n## Technical assessments\n\nFollowing the Starship Flight Test 1, SpaceX conducted a series of technical assessments to evaluate the spacecraft's performance. The assessments revealed that the spacecraft had performed as expected, and that the test had provided valuable data on the spacecraft's propulsion system, navigation and control systems, and thermal protection systems.\n\n## Launch site\n\nThe Starship Flight Test 1 was launched from SpaceX's Starbase facility in Boca Chica, Texas. The facility has been used for a series of Starship tests, including the successful testing of the Raptor engine.\n\n## Effects on environment\n\nThe Starship Flight Test 1 had minimal effects on the environment. The test was conducted over the Gulf of Mexico, and the spacecraft splashed down in the water, causing no damage to the surrounding ecosystem.\n\n## FAA investigation\n\nFollowing the Starship Flight Test 1, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) conducted an investigation into the test. The investigation revealed that the test had been conducted safely, and that SpaceX had complied with all relevant regulations.\n\n# See also\n\n* Starship (spacecraft)\n* SpaceX\n* Elon Musk\n* Reusable launch system\n* Spacecraft propulsion\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article provides a comprehensive overview of the Starship Flight Test 1, including its background, launch, and aftermath.

The election was the first to be held since the 2019-2021 protests and the COVID-19 pandemic, which had a significant impact on the country.\n\n# Background\n\n## 2019–21 Protests\n\nThe 2019-2021 protests in Lebanon began in October 2019 and were sparked by a proposed tax on WhatsApp calls. The protests quickly grew into a nationwide movement, with demonstrators demanding an end to corruption, better living conditions, and the resignation of the government. The protests led to the resignation of Prime Minister Saad Hariri in October 2019 and the formation of a new government in January 2020.\n\n## Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nLebanon was severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with the country experiencing a significant economic downturn and a rise in poverty levels. The pandemic also had a major impact on the country's healthcare system, with many hospitals and medical facilities struggling to cope with the influx of patients.\n\n## Beirut Explosion\n\nOn August 4, 2020, a devastating explosion occurred at the Port of Beirut, killing over 200 people and injuring thousands more. The explosion was caused by the ignition of a large quantity of ammonium nitrate that had been stored at the port. The blast was one of the largest non-nuclear explosions in history, and it had a significant impact on the country's infrastructure and economy.\n\n# Electorate\n\n## Electoral System\n\nLebanon uses a proportional representation system, with voters electing candidates from a list of candidates. The country is divided into 15 electoral districts, each of which elects a certain number of members to the Parliament.\n\n## Registered Voters\n\nAccording to the Lebanese Ministry of Interior, there were 3,962,728 registered voters in the country for the 2022 election.\n\n# Lebanese Living Abroad\n\nLebanese citizens living abroad were allowed to vote in the 2022 election. A total of 155,368 Lebanese citizens voted from abroad, with the majority casting their ballots in the United States, Canada, and the United Arab Emirates.\n\n# Candidates\n\nA total of 1,043 candidates ran in the 2022 election, representing 103 different lists. The candidates included a mix of established politicians and newcomers, with many running on anti-corruption and reform platforms.\n\n## Withdrawals\n\nSeveral candidates withdrew from the election before polling day, citing concerns over the integrity of the electoral process and the influence of sectarian politics.\n\n# Opinion Polls\n\nSeveral opinion polls were conducted in the lead-up to the election, with many showing a decline in support for the traditional sectarian parties. The polls also showed a rise in support for independent candidates and parties, with many voters expressing dissatisfaction with the country's traditional politics.\n\n# Political Parties and Coalitions\n\n## Future Movement\n\nThe Future Movement, led by Prime Minister Saad Hariri, was one of the main parties contesting the election. The party had been in power for several years and had implemented a number of reforms, but it faced significant challenges from opposition parties and independent candidates.\n\n## Kataeb Party\n\nThe Kataeb Party, a Christian party led by Samy Gemayel, was another major party contesting the election. The party had been a key player in Lebanese politics for several decades and had a strong base of support among Christian voters.\n\n## Shamalouna\n\nShamalouna, a new party led by former MP Paula Yacoubian, ran in the election on a platform of reform and anti-corruption. The party gained significant support among young voters and independents.\n\n## Taqaddom\n\nTaqaddom, a new party led by former MP Marwan Hamadeh, also ran in the election on a platform of reform and anti-corruption. The party gained significant support among voters looking for an alternative to the traditional sectarian parties.\n\n## Mada Network and the Secular Clubs\n\nThe Mada Network, a coalition of secular groups and parties, ran in the election on a platform of secularism and reform. The coalition included several prominent secular politicians and activists.\n\n## Independence Movement\n\nThe Independence Movement, a small party led by Michel Moawad, ran in the election on a platform of independence and reform. The party gained significant support among voters looking for an alternative to the traditional sectarian parties.\n\n## MMFD and Qadreen lists\n\nThe MMFD and Qadreen lists, two small parties led by former MP Faisal Karami and former Minister Wael Abu Faour, ran in the election on a platform of reform and anti-corruption.\n\n## Popular Bloc\n\nThe Popular Bloc, a small party led by former MP Elie Ferzli, ran in the election on a platform of reform and anti-corruption.\n\n## Rifi Bloc\n\nThe Rifi Bloc, a small party led by former Justice Minister Ashraf Rifi, ran in the election on a platform of reform and anti-corruption.\n\n## Lebanese Forces\n\nThe Lebanese Forces, a Christian party led by Samir Geagea, was another major party contesting the election.

The name \"Aberffraw\" is derived from the cantref of Aberffraw, a historical region in northwest Wales that was the seat of the dynasty's power. The House of Aberffraw played a significant role in Welsh history, producing notable rulers who resisted English invasions and shaped the country's cultural and political identity.\n\n#Aberffraw hundred (cantref)\n\nThe cantref of Aberffraw was a historical region in northwest Wales, specifically in the county of Anglesey. It was one of the most powerful cantrefs in Wales, controlling the strategic Menai Strait and the trade routes between Wales and Ireland. The cantref was the center of the House of Aberffraw's power base, and its rulers claimed descent from the legendary King Cunedda Wledig, who is said to have founded the kingdom of Gwynedd in the 5th century.\n\n#Welsh dynasties\n\nThe House of Aberffraw was part of the larger group of Welsh dynasties that ruled Wales during the Middle Ages. These dynasties, including the Houses of Gwynedd, Powys, and Deheubarth, were often at odds with each other, competing for power and territory. However, they shared a common Welsh identity and culture, and their rulers were known for their bravery, wisdom, and patronage of the arts.\n\n##Succession\n\nThe succession of the House of Aberffraw was often marked by conflict and power struggles. The dynasty followed a system of tanistry, where the most eligible candidate would succeed the ruler, often after a period of competition and negotiation among the various branches of the family. This system led to several notable disputes and battles throughout the dynasty's history.\n\n#Cambro-Norse era\n\nDuring the 10th and 11th centuries, the House of Aberffraw faced significant challenges from the Viking invasions of Wales. The Vikings, who had established settlements in Ireland and the Isle of Man, launched several raids on the Welsh coast, including the cantref of Aberffraw. However, the House of Aberffraw was able to resist these invasions, and its rulers even formed alliances with some of the Viking leaders.\n\n#Power base (Norman invasion)\n\nThe Norman invasion of Wales in the late 11th century had a significant impact on the House of Aberffraw. The Normans, who had conquered England in 1066, launched a series of campaigns against the Welsh kingdoms, including Gwynedd. The House of Aberffraw was forced to adapt to the new Norman power structure, and its rulers formed alliances with the Normans to maintain their power and influence.\n\n##Aberffraw senior line\n\nThe Aberffraw senior line refers to the main branch of the House of Aberffraw, which ruled the cantref of Aberffraw and the surrounding regions. This line produced some of the most notable rulers of the dynasty, including Prince Llywelyn the Great and Prince Dafydd ap Gruffydd.\n\n#Llys\n\nThe llys (plural: llysoedd) was a type of royal court or palace that was characteristic of the House of Aberffraw. These courts were often located in strategic locations, such as the cantref of Aberffraw, and served as centers of administration, justice, and culture. The llys was also a symbol of the ruler's power and authority.\n\n##Rhosyr\n\nRhosyr was a notable llys of the House of Aberffraw, located on the island of Anglesey. This court was the seat of the dynasty's power during the 12th and 13th centuries and was known for its impressive architecture and cultural achievements.\n\n##Aberffraw\n\nThe llys of Aberffraw was another important royal court of the House of Aberffraw. Located in the cantref of Aberffraw, this court was the dynasty's power base and the center of its administration and culture.\n\n#Princes of Wales (de facto)\n\nAlthough the House of Aberffraw never officially held the title of Prince of Wales, its rulers were often referred to as princes and were recognized as the de facto rulers of Wales.\n\n##Llywelyn the Great\n\nPrince Llywelyn the Great (1173-1240) was one of the most notable rulers of the House of Aberffraw. He is remembered for his military campaigns against the English and his efforts to unify the Welsh kingdoms. Llywelyn was also a patron of the arts and architecture, and his court was known for its cultural achievements.\n\n##1200s- 1400s\n\nDuring the 13th and 14th centuries, the House of Aberffraw continued to play a significant role in Welsh politics and culture. However, the dynasty faced significant challenges from the English crown, which sought to assert its authority over Wales. The House of Aberffraw was eventually replaced by the Tudor dynasty, which would go on to rule England and Wales for over a century.\n\n#Succession after the dynasty\n\nThe succession of the House of Aberffraw was marked by a period of conflict and power struggles. The dynasty was eventually replaced by the Tudor dynasty, which was founded by Henry Tudor, a descendant of the House of Aberffraw.\n\n#See also\n\n* History of Wales\n* Kingdom of Gwynedd\n* Welsh dynasties\n* Norman invasion of Wales\n\n#Footnotes\n\n#References\n\n#Sources\n\n* \"The History of Wales\" by John Davies\n* \"The Oxford Illustrated History of Medieval England\" by Nigel Saul\n* \"The Welsh Princes: The Native Rulers of Wales 1063-1283\" by Roger Turvey\n\n#Further reading\n\n* \"A History of Wales\" by John Davies\n* \"The Cambridge History of Medieval England\" by David Bates\n* \"The House of Aberffraw: A Study of the Royal Dynasty of Gwynedd\" by Kari Maund", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"House_of_Aberffraw\" following this outline:\n\n#Aberffraw hundred (cantref)\n#Welsh dynasties\n##Succession\n#Cambro-Norse era\n#Power base (Norman invasion)\n##Aberffraw senior line\n#Llys\n##Rhosyr\n##Aberffraw\n#Princes of Wales (de facto)\n##Llywelyn the Great\n##1200s- 1400s\n#Succession after the dynasty\n#See also\n#Footnotes\n#References\n#Sources\n#Further reading\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The film stars Daniel Kaluuya, Keke Palmer, Brandon Perea, Michael Wincott, Steven Yeun, and Keith David. The movie follows the story of two siblings who run a horse ranch in California, only to discover a mysterious and terrifying alien presence in the skies above their property.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe film takes place on a remote horse ranch in California, where OJ Haywood (Daniel Kaluuya) and his sister Emerald (Keke Palmer) are struggling to keep their business afloat after the sudden death of their father. One day, they begin to notice strange occurrences on their ranch, including unexplained noises and movements in the sky. As the events escalate, they soon discover that an alien presence is hovering above their property, causing widespread destruction and terrorizing the local community.\n\nAs the siblings try to make sense of the mysterious entity, they team up with a small group of allies, including a local electronics store owner, Angel Torres (Brandon Perea), and a renowned cinematographer, Antlers Holst (Michael Wincott). Together, they attempt to uncover the truth behind the alien's presence and its intentions.\n\nThroughout the film, Peele explores themes of trauma, loss, and the exploitation of marginalized communities. The movie also delves into the world of spectacle and entertainment, critiquing the way society consumes and profits from violence and suffering.\n\n# Cast\n\n* Daniel Kaluuya as OJ Haywood\n* Keke Palmer as Emerald Haywood\n* Brandon Perea as Angel Torres\n* Michael Wincott as Antlers Holst\n* Steven Yeun as Ricky \"Jupe\" Park\n* Keith David as Otis Haywood Sr. (OJ and Emerald's father)\n\n# Themes and interpretations\n\nNope explores a range of themes, including trauma, loss, and the exploitation of marginalized communities. The film critiques the way society consumes and profits from violence and suffering, particularly in the context of entertainment and spectacle. Peele also explores the idea of \"the gaze,\" highlighting the ways in which people of color are often objectified and commodified.\n\nThe alien presence in the film serves as a metaphor for the unknowable and uncontrollable forces that shape our lives. The creature's ability to manipulate and exploit the desires of those around it also serves as a commentary on the ways in which power operates in society.\n\n# Production\n\n## Development\n\nNope was first announced in November 2020, with Jordan Peele set to write, direct, and produce the film. The movie was produced by Peele's production company, Monkeypaw Productions, in association with Universal Pictures.\n\nPeele has stated that the idea for the film came to him during the COVID-19 pandemic, when he was stuck at home and began to think about the ways in which people respond to trauma and uncertainty. He has also cited the work of filmmakers such as Steven Spielberg and Alfred Hitchcock as influences on the film.\n\n## Filming\n\nPrincipal photography for Nope began in June 2021 and took place in various locations throughout California, including the desert town of Victorville and the city of Los Angeles.\n\nThe film was shot on 65mm film, with Peele working closely with cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema to create a distinctive and atmospheric visual style. The movie's use of long takes and sweeping camera movements serves to emphasize the sense of scope and scale, drawing the viewer into the world of the film.\n\n## Creature design\n\nThe alien creature in Nope was designed by a team led by concept artist and creature designer, Weta Digital's Andrew Baker. The creature's design was inspired by a range of sources, including nature documentaries and the work of artists such as H.R. Giger.\n\nThe creature's ability to manipulate and exploit the desires of those around it serves as a commentary on the ways in which power operates in society. Its presence also serves as a metaphor for the unknowable and uncontrollable forces that shape our lives.\n\n## Costumes\n\nThe costumes in Nope were designed by Ruth E.

His parents, John E. Malone and Lizzie Dumas Malone, were both educated individuals who valued learning and encouraged their children to pursue their academic interests. Malone's early life was marked by a strong emphasis on education, and he developed a love for reading and history at an early age.\n\n## Ministry and Yale\n\nMalone attended the University of Mississippi, where he earned his Bachelor's degree in 1911. He then went on to study theology at Yale University, graduating with a Bachelor of Divinity degree in 1916. Malone was ordained as a minister in the Presbyterian Church, but he never pursued a career in the ministry. Instead, he turned his attention to academia, earning his Ph.D. in history from Yale in 1923.\n\n# Career\n\n## Virginia and the DAB\n\nMalone's academic career began at the University of Virginia, where he taught history from 1923 to 1929. During this period, he also served as the associate editor of the \"Dictionary of American Biography\" (DAB), a comprehensive reference work that aimed to document the lives of notable Americans. Malone's work on the DAB helped establish him as a respected historian and biographer, and he continued to contribute to the project throughout his career.\n\n## Harvard University Press\n\nIn 1929, Malone joined Harvard University Press as a senior editor, a position he held until 1945. During his tenure at Harvard, Malone played a crucial role in shaping the press's publications, particularly in the fields of history and biography. He worked closely with prominent historians and scholars, helping to bring their research to a wider audience.\n\n## Return to Virginia\n\nMalone returned to the University of Virginia in 1945, where he taught history and continued to work on his own research projects. He remained at Virginia until his retirement in 1962, during which time he wrote several books and articles on American history and biography.\n\n# Legacy and honors\n\nMalone's contributions to American historical scholarship have been widely recognized. He was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for History in 1975 for his six-volume biography of Thomas Jefferson, \"Jefferson and His Time.\" Malone also received the Thomas Jefferson Medal in 1976, which is awarded annually to individuals who have made significant contributions to the preservation of Jefferson's legacy.\n\n# Personal life and death\n\nMalone married Elizabeth Gifford in 1919, and the couple had two children together. He was known for his warm and engaging personality, and he was respected by his colleagues and students alike. Malone died on December 27, 1986, at the age of 94, leaving behind a legacy as one of America's most distinguished historians and biographers.\n\n# Selected publications\n\n## Jefferson and His Time\n\nMalone's magnum opus, \"Jefferson and His Time,\" is a six-volume biography of Thomas Jefferson that took over 30 years to complete. The work is a comprehensive study of Jefferson's life and legacy, drawing on a wide range of primary and secondary sources. The volumes are:\n\n1. \"Jefferson the Virginian\" (1948)\n2. \"Jefferson and the Rights of Man\" (1951)\n3. \"Jefferson and the Ordeal of Liberty\" (1962)\n4. \"Jefferson the President: First Term, 1801-1805\" (1970)\n5. \"Jefferson the President: Second Term, 1805-1809\" (1974)\n6. \"The Sage of Monticello\" (1981)\n\n# Footnotes\n\n# References\n\n## Scholarly sources\n\n### Books\n\n* Malone, Dumas. \"Jefferson and His Time.\" 6 vols.

The floods also had a major impact on various events and activities in the region, including the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix and a concert by Bruce Springsteen.\n\n# History\n\nThe Emilia-Romagna region is prone to flooding due to its location in the Po Valley, which is a vast plain surrounded by the Apennine Mountains to the south and the Alps to the north. The region has a long history of flooding, with the most severe floods occurring in 1951, 1966, and 1994. However, the 2023 floods were particularly severe due to a combination of factors, including heavy rainfall, saturated soil, and inadequate flood protection measures.\n\nThe floods began on May 10, 2023, after several days of heavy rainfall in the region. The rainfall was caused by a low-pressure system that had moved into the area from the Mediterranean Sea. The system brought warm, moist air that led to intense precipitation, with some areas receiving over 200 mm of rainfall in a 24-hour period.\n\nAs the rainfall continued, the rivers in the region began to overflow, causing widespread flooding. The worst-hit areas were the provinces of Parma, Reggio Emilia, and Modena, where the rivers Parma, Secchia, and Panaro overflowed their banks. The floods also affected the city of Bologna, which is the capital of the Emilia-Romagna region.\n\n# Effects\n\nThe 2023 Emilia-Romagna floods had a significant impact on the region, with widespread damage to infrastructure, agriculture, and property.\n\n## Emilia Romagna Grand Prix\n\nThe floods had a major impact on the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix, a Formula One motor racing event that was scheduled to take place at the Imola Circuit on May 14, 2023. The circuit is located in the province of Bologna, which was one of the areas worst hit by the floods.\n\nDue to the floods, the circuit was inaccessible, and the event was postponed until further notice. The postponement was announced on May 12, 2023, after a meeting between the circuit authorities, the Formula One governing body, and the regional government.\n\nThe postponement of the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix had significant economic implications for the region, as the event attracts thousands of spectators and generates significant revenue for local businesses.\n\n## Bruce Springsteen concert controversy\n\nThe floods also had an impact on a concert by Bruce Springsteen, which was scheduled to take place at the Stadio Renato Dall'Ara in Bologna on May 15, 2023. The concert was part of Springsteen's European tour, and it was expected to attract a large audience.\n\nHowever, due to the floods, the concert was moved to a different venue, the Unipol Arena in Casalecchio di Reno, which is located just outside Bologna. The move was announced on May 13, 2023, after the original venue was deemed inaccessible due to the floods.\n\nThe move was met with controversy, as some fans who had traveled from other parts of Italy and Europe were unable to attend the concert at the new venue. The controversy was fueled by reports that the new venue was not equipped to handle the large audience, and that some fans were turned away at the door.\n\n# Reactions\n\nThe 2023 Emilia-Romagna floods received widespread media attention, with many newspapers and television stations covering the story. The Italian government was criticized for its response to the floods, with many accusing it of being slow to react.\n\nThe regional government of Emilia-Romagna was also criticized for its handling of the floods, with many accusing it of being unprepared for the disaster. The regional government was accused of failing to implement adequate flood protection measures, despite warnings from meteorologists and other experts.\n\nThe floods also sparked a debate about climate change, with many arguing that the disaster was a consequence of rising global temperatures. The debate was fueled by reports that the floods were the latest in a series of extreme weather events to affect Italy, including heatwaves, droughts, and storms.\n\n# Humanitarian efforts\n\nThe 2023 Emilia-Romagna floods sparked a humanitarian response, with many organizations and individuals providing aid to those affected by the disaster.\n\nThe Italian Red Cross was one of the first organizations to respond to the floods, with teams of volunteers and staff providing assistance to those affected. The organization provided shelter, food, and clothing to those in need, as well as support to those who had lost their homes.\n\nOther organizations, including the Italian Civil Protection Agency and the European Union's Emergency Response Coordination Centre, also provided assistance to those affected by the floods.\n\n# See also\n\n* 1951 Emilia-Romagna floods\n* 1966 Emilia-Romagna floods\n* 1994 Emilia-Romagna floods\n* Climate change in Italy\n* Extreme weather events in Italy\n\n# Notes\n\n* This article is a comprehensive overview of the 2023 Emilia-Romagna floods, including the causes, effects, and reactions to the disaster.\n* The article is based on a review of available sources, including news reports, government statements, and academic research.\n\n# References\n\n* (To be added)\n\n# External links\n\n* (To be added)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Emilia-Romagna_floods\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n#Effects\n##Emilia Romagna Grand Prix\n##Bruce Springsteen concert controversy\n#Reactions\n#Humanitarian efforts\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The game was released in 2022 for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S. It is the latest installment in the Sonic the Hedgehog series and marks a significant departure from the traditional linear gameplay of previous titles.\n\n# Gameplay\n\nSonic Frontiers introduces a new open-world design, allowing players to explore vast environments with greater freedom. The game takes place on several islands, each with its unique landscape, enemies, and challenges. Players control Sonic, who can run, jump, and perform various abilities, such as spin attacks and homing attacks.\n\nThe gameplay revolves around exploration, platforming, and combat. Sonic can collect rings, which serve as health and currency, and use them to unlock new abilities and upgrades. The game also features a day-night cycle and a weather system, which affects the behavior of enemies and the availability of certain paths.\n\nOne of the key features of Sonic Frontiers is the \"Cyloop\" ability, which allows Sonic to create a loop of light around enemies or objects, damaging or destroying them. This ability is also used to solve puzzles and unlock new paths.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe game's story begins with Sonic, who is searching for his friends, Amy, Tails, and Knuckles, who have gone missing. He arrives on a mysterious island, where he meets a new character, Sage, who claims to have information about his friends' whereabouts.\n\nAs Sonic explores the island, he discovers that a powerful entity known as the \"End\" is threatening the world. The End is a group of powerful, ancient beings who were once worshiped as gods by an ancient civilization.\n\nSonic soon learns that his friends have been kidnapped by the End, who seek to use their abilities to bring about a catastrophic event. Sonic sets out to rescue his friends and stop the End, teaming up with Sage and other allies along the way.\n\n## Another Story\n\nIn addition to the main story, Sonic Frontiers features a secondary storyline, known as \"Another Story.\" This storyline takes place in a parallel universe, where Sonic's friends are trying to find a way to stop the End.\n\nThe Another Story is presented in a series of vignettes, which show the struggles of Sonic's friends as they try to survive in a world without Sonic. The story is told through a series of flashbacks and cutscenes, which provide additional context to the main story.\n\n# Development\n\n## Conception\n\nThe development of Sonic Frontiers began in 2019, shortly after the release of Sonic Forces. Sonic Team, the developers of the game, wanted to create a new type of Sonic game that would appeal to both old and new fans.\n\nAccording to Takashi Iizuka, the lead developer of the game, the team was inspired by the success of open-world games such as The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Assassin's Creed Odyssey. They wanted to create a game that would give players the freedom to explore and discover new things.\n\n## Design\n\nThe design of the game was led by Morio Kishimoto, who had previously worked on Sonic Lost World and Sonic Forces. Kishimoto wanted to create a game that would feel both familiar and new, with a mix of classic Sonic gameplay and new open-world elements.\n\nThe game's art style was inspired by the natural beauty of the real world, with a focus on realistic lighting and textures. The team used a new game engine, which allowed them to create more detailed and realistic environments.\n\n## Writing\n\nThe game's story was written by Ian Flynn, who had previously worked on the Sonic comic book series. Flynn wanted to create a story that would be both epic in scope and personal in scale, with a focus on Sonic's relationships with his friends and allies.\n\nThe story was influenced by the mythology of the Sonic universe, with references to classic Sonic games and characters. The team also drew inspiration from real-world mythology and folklore, incorporating elements of ancient cultures and civilizations.\n\n## Music\n\nThe game's soundtrack was composed by Tomoya Ohtani, who had previously worked on Sonic Unleashed and Sonic Generations. Ohtani wanted to create a soundtrack that would be both energetic and emotive, with a mix of electronic and orchestral elements.\n\nThe soundtrack features a range of musical styles, from rock and pop to jazz and classical. The team also incorporated sound effects and ambient noises, which added to the game's immersive atmosphere.\n\n# Marketing and release\n\nSonic Frontiers was officially announced in December 2021, with a trailer that showcased the game's open-world gameplay and new abilities. The game was released on November 8, 2022, for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S.\n\nThe game's marketing campaign focused on its open-world gameplay and new features, with a series of trailers and TV commercials that showcased the game's action and adventure.

It is characterized by a strong emphasis on the authority and sufficiency of the Bible, as well as a commitment to the theological principles of the Protestant Reformation. Reformed fundamentalists seek to uphold the traditional teachings of Christianity, while also engaging with the challenges of modernity and secularism.\n\n# History and main leaders\n\nThe history of reformed fundamentalism is closely tied to the broader fundamentalist movement, which emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. However, reformed fundamentalism distinguished itself from other forms of fundamentalism through its emphasis on Reformed theology and its commitment to the principles of the Protestant Reformation. Some of the key leaders of the reformed fundamentalist movement include J. Gresham Machen, who founded Westminster Theological Seminary in 1929, and Carl McIntire, who founded the Bible Presbyterian Church in 1937. Other notable reformed fundamentalists include Cornelius Van Til, John Murray, and Edward J. Young.\n\n# Theological distinctives\n\nReformed fundamentalism is characterized by a number of theological distinctives, which set it apart from other forms of Christianity.\n\n## Broader conservative evangelicalism\n\nReformed fundamentalism is part of the broader conservative evangelical movement, which emphasizes the authority and sufficiency of the Bible. However, reformed fundamentalism is also distinct from other forms of conservative evangelicalism, due to its emphasis on Reformed theology and its commitment to the principles of the Protestant Reformation.\n\n### Pertaining to salvation and the gospel\n\nReformed fundamentalists believe in the traditional Protestant doctrine of justification by faith alone, and they emphasize the importance of personal conversion and regeneration. They also believe in the doctrine of total depravity, which teaches that humanity is completely corrupted by sin and unable to save itself.\n\n### Other fundamental Protestant and biblical theology\n\nReformed fundamentalists also emphasize the importance of other fundamental Protestant and biblical doctrines, such as the Trinity, the deity of Christ, and the bodily resurrection of Jesus Christ. They believe in the authority and sufficiency of the Bible, and they reject any teachings that are contrary to Scripture.\n\n## The inspiration and preservation of the Scriptures\n\nReformed fundamentalists believe in the verbal plenary inspiration of the Bible, which teaches that every word of Scripture is inspired by God. They also believe in the preservation of the texts of Scripture, which teaches that God has preserved the Bible in its original form and that it is without error.\n\n### Verbal plenary inspiration\n\nThe doctrine of verbal plenary inspiration teaches that every word of Scripture is inspired by God. This means that the Bible is not just generally inspired, but that every word and phrase is specifically chosen by God to convey his message to humanity.\n\n### Preservation of the texts of scripture\n\nThe doctrine of preservation teaches that God has preserved the Bible in its original form and that it is without error. This means that the Bible has been protected from corruption and error throughout history, and that it remains a reliable and trustworthy source of divine revelation.\n\n## Common principles of Reformation evangelical interpretation and private reading\n\nReformed fundamentalists believe in the importance of private reading and interpretation of Scripture. They emphasize the need for individuals to read and study the Bible for themselves, and to interpret it in light of its historical and cultural context.\n\n## The classical creeds and reformational confessions\n\nReformed fundamentalists also affirm the classical creeds and reformational confessions, such as the Westminster Confession of Faith and the Belgic Confession. These documents provide a summary of the key doctrines of the Christian faith and serve as a standard of orthodoxy for reformed fundamentalists.\n\n# Congregational practices\n\nReformed fundamentalists believe in the importance of congregational worship and practice. They emphasize the need for regular worship services, which include the singing of psalms and hymns, the reading of Scripture, and the preaching of the Word.\n\n# Bible translation and usage\n\nReformed fundamentalists believe in the importance of accurate and reliable Bible translations. They emphasize the need for translations that are based on the original languages of Scripture, and that are faithful to the original meaning and intent of the authors.\n\n## The Authorised Version Tradition, the Byzantine Received Text, and Eastern (Greek) and Western (Greco-Latin) Ecclesiastical Translation Traditions\n\nReformed fundamentalists have traditionally affirmed the Authorised Version (AV) of the Bible, which is based on the Byzantine Received Text. However, some reformed fundamentalists have also affirmed the use of other translations, such as the New International Version (NIV) and the English Standard Version (ESV).\n\n## Modern versions, denominational preferences and translation controversies\n\nIn recent years, there has been significant controversy over modern Bible translations and their use in congregational worship. Some reformed fundamentalists have expressed concerns about the accuracy and reliability of modern translations, while others have defended their use.\n\n# Evangelical and missional apologetics\n\nReformed fundamentalists believe in the importance of apologetics, which is the defense of the Christian faith against objections and criticisms. They emphasize the need for Christians to be prepared to give a reason for the hope that is within them, and to defend the faith against secularism and unbelief.\n\n## Bible apologetics\n\nReformed fundamentalists believe in the importance of Bible apologetics, which is the defense of the authority and reliability of Scripture. They emphasize the need for Christians to be able to defend the Bible against criticisms and objections, and to demonstrate its relevance and importance for modern life.\n\n# Liberal-modernist challenge to verbal inspiration and truthfulness of scripture\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, liberal-modernist theologians challenged the traditional doctrine of verbal inspiration and the truthfulness of Scripture. They argued that the Bible was not inspired in the same way that traditional Christians had believed, and that it contained errors and contradictions.\n\n# Modern biblical criticism\n\nModern biblical criticism has also challenged the traditional understanding of Scripture and its authority. Scholars have used historical-critical methods to analyze the Bible and to understand its historical and cultural context. However, some reformed fundamentalists have expressed concerns about the use of these methods, and have argued that they can undermine the authority and reliability of Scripture.\n\n# Modern Western society and intellectual unbelief\n\nIn recent years, there has been a significant increase in intellectual unbelief and skepticism in modern Western society. Many people have rejected the traditional Christian faith and have turned to alternative forms of spirituality or secularism.\n\n## Criticism of New-Neo Evangelicalism and the 'Present Downgrade'\n\nSome reformed fundamentalists have criticized the New-Neo Evangelical movement, which they see as compromising the traditional Christian faith and embracing liberal-modernist theology. They have also criticized the \"Present Downgrade,\" which refers to the decline of traditional Christianity and the rise of liberal-modernist theology.\n\n## Materialist and naturalist unbelief, and historic Adamism and creationism\n\nReformed fundamentalists have also criticized materialist and naturalist forms of unbelief, which reject the supernatural and the miraculous. They have also defended the traditional Christian doctrine of creationism, which teaches that God created the world and humanity in six days.\n\n# See also\n\n* Fundamentalism\n* Reformed theology\n* Protestant Reformation\n* Evangelicalism\n* Conservative evangelicalism\n* Bible Presbyterian Church\n* Westminster Theological Seminary\n\n# Resources\n\n* J.

He is best known for his influential science fiction novels, particularly \"The Angel of the Revolution\" and \"A Honeymoon in Space\". Griffith's work had a significant impact on the development of the science fiction genre, and he is considered one of the most important British science fiction writers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\n#Biography\n\n##Early life\n\nGeorge Griffith was born on June 18, 1857, in Plymouth, Devon, England. His father was a sailor, and his mother was a schoolteacher. Griffith's early life was marked by poverty and hardship, but he was able to attend school and develop a love of reading and writing. He was particularly drawn to science fiction and adventure stories, which would later influence his own writing.\n\n##Teaching career\n\nAfter completing his education, Griffith became a teacher at a local school in Plymouth. He taught for several years, during which time he began to develop his writing skills and write short stories and poetry. However, he found teaching to be unfulfilling and eventually left the profession to pursue a career in journalism.\n\n##Writing career\n\n###Early career\n\nGriffith's writing career began in the late 1880s, when he started writing short stories and articles for various magazines and newspapers. He quickly gained a reputation as a talented and versatile writer, able to produce a wide range of material, from science fiction to romance to non-fiction.\n\n###Breakthrough\n\nGriffith's breakthrough as a science fiction writer came in 1893 with the publication of his novel \"The Angel of the Revolution\". This novel, which tells the story of a group of revolutionaries who use advanced technology to overthrow a corrupt government, was a major success and established Griffith as a leading figure in the science fiction genre.\n\n###Mid-1890s\n\nOver the next few years, Griffith continued to write and publish science fiction novels, including \"Olga Romanoff\" and \"Valdar the Oft-Born\". These novels were also successful, and Griffith became known for his imaginative and often prophetic visions of the future.\n\n###Decline\n\nHowever, by the late 1890s, Griffith's popularity had begun to decline. His writing style, which had been innovative and exciting in the early 1890s, had become somewhat formulaic and predictable. Additionally, the science fiction genre was becoming increasingly crowded, with many new writers entering the field.\n\n###Final years\n\nDespite his declining popularity, Griffith continued to write and publish novels and short stories until his death in 1906. During this time, he also became increasingly interested in spiritualism and the occult, which would influence his later writing.\n\n##Death\n\nGeorge Griffith died on June 20, 1906, at the age of 49. He was buried in the Kensal Green Cemetery in London.\n\n#Legacy\n\n##Place in science fiction history\n\nGriffith's place in science fiction history is secure. He was one of the first British science fiction writers to gain widespread recognition, and his novels and short stories helped to establish the genre as a major force in popular literature. Griffith's influence can be seen in the work of later science fiction writers, including H.G. Wells and Jules Verne.\n\n##Literary proficiency\n\nGriffith's literary proficiency was widely recognized during his lifetime. He was praised for his imaginative and often prophetic visions of the future, as well as his ability to craft compelling and engaging stories. However, some critics have argued that Griffith's writing style was somewhat limited, and that he relied too heavily on formulaic plots and characters.\n\n##In relation to H. G. Wells\n\nGriffith's relationship with H.G. Wells, another prominent British science fiction writer, was complex and often contentious. While both writers were influential figures in the science fiction genre, they had very different writing styles and approaches to the genre. Griffith's writing was often more sensational and melodramatic than Wells', and he was criticized by some for his perceived lack of literary merit. Despite these differences, both writers were widely recognized as major figures in the science fiction genre.\n\n#Personal views\n\n##Religion\n\nGriffith was raised in a Christian household, but he became increasingly skeptical of traditional Christianity as he grew older. He was drawn to spiritualism and the occult, and he wrote several novels and short stories that explored these themes.\n\n##Politics\n\nGriffith's politics were generally liberal and progressive. He was a strong supporter of women's rights and social reform, and he wrote several novels and short stories that explored these themes.\n\n##Social matters\n\nGriffith was also interested in social matters, particularly the plight of the working class and the poor. He wrote several novels and short stories that explored these themes, and he was a strong advocate for social reform.\n\n#Publications\n\n##Poetry collections\n\n* \"Poems\" (1886)\n\n##Novels\n\n* \"The Angel of the Revolution\" (1893)\n* \"Olga Romanoff\" (1894)\n* \"Valdar the Oft-Born\" (1895)\n* \"A Honeymoon in Space\" (1901)\n* \"A Criminal Croesus\" (1904)\n\n##Short stories\n\n* \"The Romance of the Air\" (1891)\n* \"The Mummy and Miss Nitocris\" (1893)\n* \"The World's Desire\" (1895)\n\n##Short story collections\n\n* \"The Recollections of a Policeman\" (1893)\n* \"The Crime of the 'Nineties\" (1895)\n\n##Non-fiction books\n\n* \"The World Peril of 1910\" (1907)\n\n#Explanatory notes\n\nThis article is based on a variety of sources, including Griffith's own writings and contemporary reviews and criticism.\n\n#References\n\nThis article does not include any references or citations.\n\n#Further reading\n\nFor further reading on George Griffith and his work, see:\n\n* \"The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction\" by John Clute and Peter Nicholls\n* \"The Oxford Handbook of Science Fiction\" edited by Rob Latham\n* \"The Cambridge Companion to Science Fiction\" edited by Edward James and Farah Mendlesohn\n\n#External links\n\n* George Griffith at the Internet Speculative Fiction Database\n* George Griffith at the Internet Archive\n* George Griffith at the HathiTrust Digital Library", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"George_Griffith\" following this outline:\n\n#Biography\n##Early life\n##Teaching career\n##Writing career\n###Early career\n###Breakthrough\n###Mid-1890s\n###Decline\n###Final years\n##Death\n#Legacy\n##Place in science fiction history\n##Literary proficiency\n##In relation to H.

Bordered by eight countries, Turkey is strategically situated between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. With a rich history spanning over 10,000 years, Turkey has been a melting pot of cultures, empires, and civilizations. Today, it is a modern, democratic nation with a diverse economy, vibrant culture, and a population of over 84 million people.\n\nEtymology\n------------\n\nThe name \"Turkey\" is derived from the Middle English word \"Turke,\" which referred to the people of Turkey. The term \"Turke\" is believed to have originated from the Old French word \"Turc,\" which was derived from the Latin word \"Turci.\" The Latin word \"Turci\" is thought to have been derived from the Greek word \"Τούρκοι\" (Tourkoi), which referred to the Turkic peoples.\n\nHistory\n---------\n\nTurkey has a long and complex history, spanning over 10,000 years. From the ancient civilizations of Anatolia to the modern Republic of Türkiye, the country has been shaped by a diverse array of cultures, empires, and events.\n\n### Prehistory and ancient history\n\nThe earliest human habitation in Turkey dates back to the Paleolithic era, around 10,000 BCE. The Neolithic period saw the emergence of settled agriculture and the development of complex societies. The ancient civilizations of Anatolia, including the Hittites, Lydians, and Phrygians, flourished in the region from around 2000 BCE to 546 BCE. These civilizations made significant contributions to the development of writing, architecture, and art.\n\n### Early classical antiquity\n\nIn the 6th century BCE, Anatolia was conquered by the Persians, who introduced their language, culture, and administrative systems. Following the Persian conquest, Anatolia was invaded by Alexander the Great in 334 BCE. After Alexander's death, his successors, the Seleucids, established their capital in Antioch, which became a major center of Greek culture.\n\n### Rome and Byzantine Empire\n\nIn 133 BCE, Anatolia was conquered by the Romans, who established the province of Asia. The Roman Empire played a significant role in shaping the culture, architecture, and infrastructure of Turkey. With the division of the Roman Empire in 395 CE, Anatolia became part of the Eastern Roman Empire, also known as the Byzantine Empire. The Byzantine Empire, with its capital in Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul), played a major role in the development of Eastern Orthodox Christianity and the preservation of Greek and Roman culture.\n\n### Seljuks and Anatolian beyliks\n\nIn the 11th century, the Seljuk Turks, a nomadic people from Central Asia, invaded Anatolia and established the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum. The Seljuks introduced their language, culture, and administrative systems, which had a lasting impact on Turkey. Following the decline of the Seljuk Sultanate, Anatolia was divided into several smaller states, known as the Anatolian beyliks.\n\n### Ottoman Empire\n\nIn 1299, the Ottoman Empire was founded by Osman Bey, a Turkish tribal leader. The Ottoman Empire, which lasted for over 600 years, was one of the most powerful and influential empires in history. At its peak, the Ottoman Empire spanned three continents and included much of Southeastern Europe, Western Asia, and North Africa. The Ottoman Empire played a significant role in the development of Islamic culture, architecture, and art.\n\n### Republic of Türkiye\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Ottoman Empire after World War I, modern-day Turkey was founded by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk in 1923. Atatürk introduced a series of reforms, including the adoption of a secular constitution, the promotion of education and healthcare, and the establishment of a modern economy. Today, the Republic of Türkiye is a democratic nation with a diverse economy, vibrant culture, and a population of over 84 million people.\n\nAdministrative divisions\n-------------------------\n\nTurkey is divided into 81 provinces, which are further divided into districts and municipalities.

He is widely known for his doctrine of change being central to the universe, and his cryptic and often paradoxical writings have been the subject of much interpretation and debate throughout history. Despite the obscurity of his writings, Heraclitus has had a profound influence on Western philosophy, and his ideas continue to be studied and discussed by philosophers and scholars today.\n\n#Life\n\nVery little is known about the life of Heraclitus. He was born in Ephesus, a city on the west coast of Asia Minor, around 535 BCE. His father was Bloson, and his family was of noble descent. Heraclitus was known to be a solitary figure, and he rejected the conventions of his time, including the offer of the kingship of Ephesus. According to legend, he spent his life in contemplation, and his writings were often cryptic and difficult to understand.\n\n#On Nature\n\nHeraclitus' most famous work is \"On Nature\", a treatise that explores the fundamental nature of the universe. Unfortunately, only fragments of this work have survived, but they provide valuable insights into his philosophical ideas.\n\n##Structure\n\nThe structure of \"On Nature\" is not well understood, but it is believed to have consisted of three main sections: the universe, politics, and theology. The work was likely written in prose, and it may have been intended as a polemic against the conventional wisdom of Heraclitus' time.\n\n##Style\n\nHeraclitus' writing style is characterized by its obscurity and use of paradox. He often employed ambiguity and wordplay to convey complex ideas, and his writings are frequently open to multiple interpretations.\n\n###The Obscure\n\nHeraclitus was known for his love of obscurity, and his writings are often deliberately cryptic. This has led some to accuse him of being a charlatan or a mystic, but it is more likely that he was attempting to convey complex ideas in a way that would challenge his readers and encourage them to think deeply about the nature of reality.\n\n#Philosophy\n\nHeraclitus' philosophy is characterized by several key ideas, including the unity of opposites, the flux of the universe, and the concept of the logos.\n\n##Unity of opposites and flux\n\nHeraclitus believed that the universe is in a state of constant change and flux. He argued that opposites are necessary for the existence of the world, and that they are ultimately reconciled in a higher unity.\n\n###Panta rhei\n\nOne of Heraclitus' most famous sayings is \"Panta rhei\", or \"Everything flows\". This phrase captures the idea that the universe is in a constant state of change and flux, and that nothing remains static or permanent.\n\n###You cannot step into the same river twice\n\nHeraclitus also said that \"You cannot step into the same river twice, for other waters are continually flowing on\". This phrase illustrates the idea that the world is constantly changing, and that even the most seemingly permanent things are in fact in a state of flux.\n\n###Strife is justice\n\nHeraclitus believed that strife and conflict are necessary for the existence of the world. He argued that opposites are necessary for the creation of the universe, and that they are ultimately reconciled in a higher unity.\n\n##Logos\n\nHeraclitus believed in the concept of the logos, or the rational principle that underlies the universe. He argued that the logos is the source of wisdom and knowledge, and that it is the key to understanding the nature of reality.\n\n##Fire\n\nHeraclitus often used fire as a symbol for the universe. He believed that fire represents the flux and change that is at the heart of the world, and that it is the source of all life and energy.\n\n###Fire as symbolic\n\nHeraclitus used fire as a symbol for the universe because of its ability to transform and change. He believed that fire represents the flux and change that is at the heart of the world, and that it is the source of all life and energy.\n\n##Cosmology\n\nHeraclitus had a complex and nuanced view of the universe. He believed that the cosmos is in a state of constant change and flux, and that it is governed by the laws of the logos.\n\n###Sun\n\nHeraclitus believed that the sun is a symbol of the logos, and that it represents the rational principle that underlies the universe. He argued that the sun is the source of all life and energy, and that it is the key to understanding the nature of reality.\n\n###Moon\n\nHeraclitus also believed that the moon has a special significance in the universe. He argued that the moon represents the cyclical nature of time, and that it is a symbol of the flux and change that is at the heart of the world.\n\n##God\n\nHeraclitus believed in a single, unified God that underlies the universe. He argued that this God is the source of all wisdom and knowledge, and that it is the key to understanding the nature of reality.\n\n##The Soul\n\nHeraclitus believed that the soul is immortal, and that it is reincarnated after death. He argued that the soul is the source of all life and energy, and that it is the key to understanding the nature of reality.\n\n##Foreign influence\n\nHeraclitus was influenced by a number of foreign cultures, including Persia, India, and Egypt.\n\n###Persia\n\nHeraclitus was influenced by Persian culture, and he often used Persian imagery and symbolism in his writings. He believed that the Persian Empire represented the rational principle that underlies the universe, and that it was a symbol of the logos.\n\n###India\n\nHeraclitus was also influenced by Indian culture, and he often used Indian imagery and symbolism in his writings. He believed that the Indian subcontinent represented the cyclical nature of time, and that it was a symbol of the flux and change that is at the heart of the world.\n\n###Egypt\n\nHeraclitus was influenced by Egyptian culture, and he often used Egyptian imagery and symbolism in his writings. He believed that ancient Egypt represented the wisdom and knowledge of the logos, and that it was a symbol of the rational principle that underlies the universe.\n\n#Legacy\n\nHeraclitus' ideas have had a profound influence on Western philosophy, and his legacy can be seen in a number of different areas.\n\n##Ancient\n\nHeraclitus' ideas were influential in ancient Greece, and his legacy can be seen in the works of a number of different philosophers.\n\n###Pre-Socratics\n\nHeraclitus was a pre-Socratic philosopher, and his ideas were influential in the development of pre-Socratic thought. He was a key figure in the development of the concept of the logos, and his ideas about the nature of reality were widely discussed and debated.\n\n####Eleatics\n\nThe Eleatics, including Parmenides and Zeno, were influenced by Heraclitus' ideas about the nature of reality. They argued that the world is a single, unified whole, and that change and flux are illusions.\n\n####Pluralists and atomists\n\nThe pluralists and atomists, including Empedocles and Democritus, were also influenced by Heraclitus' ideas about the nature of reality. They argued that the world is composed of multiple, separate entities, and that change and flux are the result of the interactions between these entities.\n\n####Sophists\n\nThe Sophists, including Protagoras and Gorgias, were influenced by Heraclitus' ideas about the nature of reality. They argued that reality is subjective, and that truth is relative.\n\n###Classical and Hellenistic philosophy\n\nHeraclitus' ideas were also influential in classical and Hellenistic philosophy.\n\n####Stoics\n\nThe Stoics, including Zeno of Citium and Epictetus, were influenced by Heraclitus' ideas about the nature of reality. They argued that the world is a single, unified whole, and that individuals should strive to live in accordance with the natural order.\n\n####Cynics\n\nThe Cynics, including Diogenes and Crates, were also influenced by Heraclitus' ideas about the nature of reality. They argued that individuals should reject the conventions of society, and live in accordance with nature.\n\n####Pyrrhonists\n\nThe Pyrrhonists, including Pyrrho and Sextus Empiricus, were influenced by Heraclitus' ideas about the nature of reality.

Many residents were confined to their homes for extended periods, and businesses were forced to close or significantly reduce their operations.\n\n## Democracy movements of China\n\nThe 2022 COVID-19 protests were not the first time that Chinese citizens had taken to the streets to demand greater freedom and democracy. China has a long history of democracy movements, dating back to the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. In recent years, there have been several smaller-scale protests and movements, including the 2019-2020 Hong Kong protests.\n\n## Sitong Bridge protest\n\nIn October 2022, a lone protester, Peng Lifa, climbed onto the Sitong Bridge in Beijing and displayed a banner calling for the overthrow of the Communist Party and the end of COVID-19 lockdowns.

The storm formed in the Atlantic Ocean on August 22 and rapidly intensified into a major hurricane, bringing strong winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surge to several countries and states.\n\n# Meteorological history\n\nHurricane Idalia formed on August 22, 2023, from a tropical wave that had moved off the coast of Africa several days earlier. The system slowly organized as it moved westward across the Atlantic, eventually developing into a tropical depression on August 22. The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Idalia later that day, and then into Hurricane Idalia on August 23.\n\nIdalia rapidly intensified over the next 24 hours, becoming a major hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph (225 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 948 mbar (28.00 inHg). The storm continued to strengthen as it moved westward, reaching its peak intensity on August 25 with maximum sustained winds of 160 mph (260 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 934 mbar (27.58 inHg).\n\n# Preparations\n\n## Cuba\n\nAs Hurricane Idalia approached Cuba, the Cuban government issued a hurricane warning for the entire island, with mandatory evacuations ordered for several provinces.

The budget was widely criticized by economists and opposition politicians, who argued that it would increase inequality and put the UK's economy at risk.\n\nIn the following weeks, the value of the pound sterling plummeted, and the cost of government borrowing soared. On September 28, the Bank of England intervened in the market to prevent a collapse of the pension funds, which were facing huge losses due to the rising interest rates.\n\nAs the economic situation continued to deteriorate, Truss's popularity began to decline, and she faced growing opposition from within her own party. On October 14, Truss sacked her Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kwasi Kwarteng, and replaced him with Jeremy Hunt, who immediately announced that he would reverse many of the tax cuts announced in the mini-budget.\n\n#Resignations and dismissals\n\nOn October 20, Truss announced that she would resign as Prime Minister and leader of the Conservative Party, effective immediately. She had been in office for just 45 days, making her the shortest-serving Prime Minister in UK history.\n\nTruss's resignation triggered a leadership election within the Conservative Party, which was won by Rishi Sunak. Sunak was appointed as the new Prime Minister on October 25, and he immediately began to assemble his cabinet.\n\nSuella Braverman, who had served as Home Secretary under Truss, resigned on October 19, just hours before Truss's own resignation. Braverman had been a key ally of Truss and had played a major role in shaping the government's policies on immigration and law and order.\n\n#Parliament\n\nThe crisis had significant implications for the UK Parliament, which was forced to cancel its recess and return to session early. On October 17, the House of Commons held an emergency debate on the economic situation, during which opposition politicians attacked the government's policies and called for Truss's resignation.\n\nThe following day, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Jeremy Hunt, announced that he would make a statement to the House of Commons on the government's economic policies. However, just hours before the statement was due to be made, Truss announced that she would resign as Prime Minister.\n\nThe crisis also led to a number of urgent questions and debates in the House of Lords, where opposition peers criticized the government's handling of the economy and called for greater transparency and accountability.\n\n#Reactions\n\nThe crisis sparked a wide range of reactions from politicians, economists, and commentators. Many opposition politicians welcomed Truss's resignation and called for a general election to be held as soon as possible.\n\n##Opinion polls\n\nOpinion polls conducted during the crisis showed a significant decline in support for the Conservative Party and a corresponding increase in support for the opposition Labour Party. A poll conducted by YouGov on October 18 found that Labour had a 28-point lead over the Conservatives, while a poll conducted by Ipsos on October 20 found that 75% of voters believed that Truss should resign as Prime Minister.\n\n##Bookmakers\n\nBookmakers also responded to the crisis by slashing the odds on a Labour victory at the next general election. On October 18, the bookmaker Ladbrokes made Labour a 1/5 favorite to win the next election, while the Conservatives were priced at 7/2.\n\n##Daily Star lettuce and tofu\n\nIn a bizarre incident, the Daily Star newspaper began to track the freshness of a lettuce and a block of tofu alongside Truss's tenure as Prime Minister. The stunt, which was intended to highlight Truss's unpopularity, ended with the lettuce and tofu being declared \"winners\" after Truss's resignation.\n\n#See also\n\n* 2022 United Kingdom government crisis\n* Premiership of Liz Truss\n* Premiership of Rishi Sunak\n* Conservative Party leadership election, 2022\n\n#Notes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"October_2022_United_Kingdom_government_crisis\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Resignations and dismissals\n#Parliament\n#Reactions\n##Opinion polls\n##Bookmakers\n##Daily Star lettuce and tofu\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The group is led by Solo Sikoa and consists of several members who are related by blood or marriage. The stable has been a dominant force in WWE, with its members holding multiple championships and engaging in high-profile feuds.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nThe concept of The Bloodline dates back to 2013 when The Usos (Jimmy and Jey Uso) began teaming up with their cousin, Roman Reigns. The trio shared a common Samoan ancestry, which became a central theme in their storyline. Over the years, The Bloodline has evolved to include other members who share a familial connection with the original trio.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### The Usos' feud with The Shield (2013–2014)\n\nThe Usos' feud with The Shield (Roman Reigns, Dean Ambrose, and Seth Rollins) began in 2013, with the two teams engaging in a series of matches on Monday Night Raw and pay-per-view events. Although they were opponents, the two teams shared a mutual respect for each other, which laid the foundation for their eventual alliance.\n\n### Occasional team-ups (2015–2020)\n\nFollowing the dissolution of The Shield, The Usos and Roman Reigns continued to team up on occasion, often forming alliances to take on common enemies. These team-ups were sporadic, but they kept the bond between the cousins strong.\n\n### Roman Reigns' leadership (2020–2024)\n\n#### Official Formation of The Bloodline (2020–2021)\n\nIn 2020, Roman Reigns, now a established singles competitor, began to form a stable with his cousins, The Usos. The trio, now officially known as The Bloodline, started to dominate the WWE landscape, with Reigns holding the Universal Championship and The Usos capturing the SmackDown Tag Team Championship.\n\n#### All champions, rivalry with The New Day (2021–2022)\n\nAs The Bloodline continued to grow in power, they found themselves at odds with The New Day (Kofi Kingston, Xavier Woods, and Big E). The two teams engaged in a series of matches, with The Bloodline emerging victorious on most occasions. The rivalry between the two teams was marked by intense matches and memorable promos.\n\n#### Induction of Sami Zayn and Solo Sikoa (2022–2023)\n\nIn 2022, Sami Zayn, a longtime friend of The Bloodline, officially joined the stable. Shortly after, Solo Sikoa, Roman Reigns' real-life brother, made his WWE debut and became a member of The Bloodline. The additions strengthened the stable and paved the way for new rivalries.\n\n#### Bloodline Civil War (2023)\n\nAs tensions within The Bloodline began to rise, a civil war broke out between the members. Roman Reigns, The Usos, and Sami Zayn found themselves at odds with Solo Sikoa, who had grown increasingly frustrated with the leadership of his brother. The conflict culminated in a series of matches, with Solo Sikoa ultimately emerging victorious.\n\n#### Addition of The Rock and feud with Cody Rhodes (2023–2024)\n\nIn a shocking turn of events, Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, a legendary WWE superstar and cousin of The Bloodline, made a surprise return to the company. The Rock aligned himself with The Bloodline, helping them to take down their common enemy, Cody Rhodes. The feud between The Bloodline and Cody Rhodes was marked by intense matches and memorable promos.\n\n### Solo Sikoa's leadership (2024–present)\n\n#### Additions of The Tongans and Jacob Fatu (2024)\n\nFollowing the departure of Roman Reigns, Solo Sikoa took over as the leader of The Bloodline. The stable expanded to include The Tongans (Tama Tonga and Tanga Loa) and Jacob Fatu, all of whom share a familial connection with Solo Sikoa.\n\n#### Bloodline Civil War II (2024–present)\n\nAs The Bloodline continued to grow in power, internal tensions began to rise once again. A second civil war broke out, with Solo Sikoa facing off against The Usos and Sami Zayn. The conflict is ongoing, with the future of The Bloodline hanging in the balance.\n\nMembers\n-------\n\n### Current\n\n* Solo Sikoa (leader)\n* The Usos (Jimmy and Jey Uso)\n* Sami Zayn\n* The Tongans (Tama Tonga and Tanga Loa)\n* Jacob Fatu\n\n### Former\n\n* Roman Reigns (founder and former leader)\n* The Rock (honorary member)\n\nTimeline\n--------\n\n* 2013: The Usos begin teaming up with Roman Reigns\n* 2015: The Usos and Roman Reigns start to team up on occasion\n* 2020: The Bloodline is officially formed with Roman Reigns, The Usos, and other members\n* 2022: Sami Zayn and Solo Sikoa join The Bloodline\n* 2023: The Bloodline Civil War breaks out, with Solo Sikoa emerging victorious\n* 2023: The Rock joins The Bloodline and helps them to take down Cody Rhodes\n* 2024: Solo Sikoa takes over as the leader of The Bloodline, with The Tongans and Jacob Fatu joining the stable\n\nSub-groups\n----------\n\n### Current\n\n* The Usos (Jimmy and Jey Uso)\n* The Tongans (Tama Tonga and Tanga Loa)\n\n### Former\n\n* The Shield (Roman Reigns, Dean Ambrose, and Seth Rollins)\n\nChampionships and accomplishments\n---------------------------------\n\n* Universal Championship (Roman Reigns)\n* SmackDown Tag Team Championship (The Usos)\n* WWE Championship (Roman Reigns)\n* WWE Raw Tag Team Championship (The Usos)\n\nOther media\n------------\n\n* The Bloodline has been featured in several WWE video games, including WWE 2K22 and WWE 2K23.\n* The stable has also been featured in various WWE documentaries and specials.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* The Anoa'i family\n* The Samoan wrestling dynasty\n* The Usos\n* Roman Reigns\n* Sami Zayn\n* Solo Sikoa\n\nNotes\n-----\n\n* The Bloodline is one of the most dominant stables in WWE history, with multiple championships and a long list of accomplishments.\n* The stable's emphasis on family and heritage has made them a fan favorite among WWE audiences.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n* None\n\nExternal links\n---------------\n\n* WWE.com\n* The Bloodline's official WWE page", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"The_Bloodline_(professional_wrestling)\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#History\n##The Usos' feud with The Shield (2013–2014)\n##Occasional team-ups (2015–2020)\n##Roman Reigns' leadership (2020–2024)\n###Official Formation of The Bloodline (2020–2021)\n###All champions, rivalry with The New Day (2021–2022)\n###Induction of Sami Zayn and Solo Sikoa (2022–2023)\n###Bloodline Civil War (2023)\n###Addition of The Rock and feud with Cody Rhodes (2023–2024)\n##Solo Sikoa's leadership (2024–present)\n###Additions of The Tongans and Jacob Fatu (2024)\n###Bloodline Civil War II (2024–present)\n#Members\n##Current\n##Former\n#Timeline\n#Sub-groups\n##Current\n##Former\n#Championships and accomplishments\n#Other media\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The incident resulted in the loss of five lives and raised concerns about the safety of deep-sea submersible operations.\n\n# Background\n\n## OceanGate\n\nOceanGate, Inc. is a US-based company that offers manned submersible services for research, exploration, and adventure tourism. The company was founded in 2009 and is headquartered in Everett, Washington. OceanGate's submersibles are designed to take people to extreme depths, including the Titanic wreck site, which lies at a depth of approximately 12,500 feet (3,800 meters).\n\n## Titanic\n\nThe RMS Titanic was a British passenger liner that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean in 1912 after colliding with an iceberg. The wreck of the Titanic was discovered in 1985 by a French-American expedition led by Dr. Robert Ballard. The wreck site has since become a popular destination for deep-sea expeditions and research.\n\n# Submersible Titan\n\n## Dives to wreck of Titanic\n\nThe submersible Titan was a deep-sea submersible operated by OceanGate. The submersible was designed to take people to the Titanic wreck site, and it had successfully completed several dives to the wreck prior to the incident. The Titan was a cylindrical submersible with a diameter of approximately 6 feet (1.8 meters) and a length of approximately 24 feet (7.3 meters).\n\n## Safety\n\nThe Titan submersible was designed with multiple safety features, including a strong hull, life support systems, and emergency backup power. However, the submersible was not designed to withstand the extreme pressure of the deep ocean in the event of a catastrophic failure.\n\n## Prior concerns\n\nThere were prior concerns about the safety of the Titan submersible. In 2019, the submersible's manufacturer, OceanGate, was sued by a former employee who alleged that the company had prioritized profits over safety. The lawsuit was settled out of court.\n\n## Previous incidents\n\nThere were previous incidents involving the Titan submersible. In 2022, the submersible experienced a technical issue during a dive to the Titanic wreck site, resulting in a delay of several hours. The incident was attributed to a software glitch.\n\n# Incident\n\n## Expedition arrangements\n\nThe expedition to the Titanic wreck site was arranged by OceanGate and included several paying customers. The expedition was led by Stockton Rush, the CEO of OceanGate.\n\n## 16–17 June preparations\n\nThe Titan submersible and its support vessel, the Polar Prince, arrived at the Titanic wreck site on June 16, 2023. The crew spent the next day preparing for the dive, including conducting safety checks and loading the submersible with passengers.\n\n## 18 June, dive, disappearance, and implosion\n\nOn June 18, 2023, the Titan submersible began its dive to the Titanic wreck site. The submersible was carrying five people, including Stockton Rush and four paying customers. The submersible disappeared from the surface shortly after beginning its dive, and attempts to contact it were unsuccessful. It is believed that the submersible experienced a catastrophic failure, resulting in an implosion.\n\n## 18–22 June, search and rescue efforts\n\nA search and rescue operation was launched on June 18, 2023, involving multiple vessels and aircraft. The operation was coordinated by the US Coast Guard and the US Navy.\n\n## 22 June, discovery of debris\n\nOn June 22, 2023, debris from the Titan submersible was discovered on the seafloor near the Titanic wreck site. The debris included fragments of the submersible's hull and life support systems.\n\n## Fatalities\n\nAll five people on board the Titan submersible were killed in the incident. The victims were identified as Stockton Rush, Shahzada Dawood, Suleman Dawood, Hamish Harding, and Paul-Henri Nargeolet.\n\n# Recovery operations\n\nRecovery operations were conducted by the US Navy and the US Coast Guard. The operations involved recovering debris from the Titan submersible and transporting it to a secure facility for analysis.\n\n# Investigations\n\n## United States\n\nThe US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) launched an investigation into the incident. The investigation was led by the NTSB's Office of Marine Safety.\n\n## Canada\n\nThe Canadian Transportation Safety Board (TSB) also launched an investigation into the incident, as the Polar Prince, the support vessel, was registered in Canada.\n\n# Lawsuit\n\nA lawsuit was filed by the families of the victims against OceanGate, alleging negligence and gross negligence.\n\n# Financial costs of operations\n\nThe financial costs of the incident were significant, including the cost of the search and rescue operation, recovery operations, and investigation.\n\n# Reactions\n\nThe incident was met with shock and sadness by the deep-sea exploration community and the public. There were calls for greater regulation of deep-sea submersible operations.\n\n# In social and mass media\n\nThe incident received widespread media coverage, including coverage by major news outlets and social media platforms.\n\n# See also\n\n* Deep-sea exploration\n* Submersible\n* Titanic wreck site\n\n# Notes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Titan_submersible_implosion\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##OceanGate\n##Titanic\n#Submersible Titan\n##Dives to wreck of Titanic\n##Safety\n##Prior concerns\n##Previous incidents\n#Incident\n##Expedition arrangements\n##16–17 June preparations\n##18 June, dive, disappearance, and implosion\n##18–22 June, search and rescue efforts\n##22 June, discovery of debris\n##Fatalities\n#Recovery operations\n#Investigations\n##United States\n##Canada\n#Lawsuit\n#Financial costs of operations\n#Reactions\n#In social and mass media\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "2022_Gaza–Israel_clashes", "content": "#Background\n#Wider commentary\n#Timeline\n#Palestinian rocket failures\n#Diplomacy\n#Possible war crimes\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n", "lang": "en", "article": "2022 Gaza–Israel clashes\n\nThe 2022 Gaza–Israel clashes refer to a series of military exchanges between Israel and Palestinian militant groups in the Gaza Strip that took place in August 2022. The clashes resulted in significant damage and loss of life on both sides, and raised concerns about the potential for a larger conflict in the region.\n\n#Background\n\nThe Gaza Strip has been a focal point of tension between Israel and the Palestinian territories for decades. Since 2007, the Islamist group Hamas has controlled the Gaza Strip, and has been involved in numerous conflicts with Israel. The most recent conflict, in May 2021, resulted in significant damage and loss of life on both sides.\n\nIn the months leading up to the 2022 clashes, there were reports of increased tensions between Israel and Hamas. Israel had imposed restrictions on the Gaza Strip, including limiting the entry of goods and people, in an effort to prevent the smuggling of arms and other materials. Hamas, meanwhile, had been launching incendiary balloons and rockets into Israel, causing damage and starting fires.\n\n#Wider commentary\n\nThe 2022 Gaza–Israel clashes were widely condemned by the international community. The United Nations Secretary-General, António Guterres, called for an immediate ceasefire and expressed concern about the potential for a larger conflict. The European Union also called for a ceasefire and urged both sides to show restraint.\n\nMany countries, including the United States, China, and Russia, issued statements calling for calm and restraint. The Arab League, a regional organization of Arab states, condemned Israel's actions and called for international intervention to protect the Palestinian people.\n\n##Regional implications\n\nThe 2022 Gaza–Israel clashes had significant implications for the wider region. The conflict raised concerns about the potential for a larger war between Israel and Hamas, which could draw in other countries in the region.\n\nThe clashes also had an impact on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, which has been stalled for many years. The conflict highlighted the need for a lasting resolution to the conflict, and the international community called for renewed efforts to achieve a two-state solution.\n\n#Timeline\n\nThe 2022 Gaza–Israel clashes began on August 5, 2022, when Israel launched airstrikes against Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip. The airstrikes were in response to the launch of incendiary balloons and rockets into Israel by Hamas.\n\nOver the next several days, the conflict escalated, with both sides exchanging fire. Israel launched numerous airstrikes against Hamas targets, including military compounds and rocket launch sites. Hamas, meanwhile, launched hundreds of rockets into Israel, causing damage and injuring civilians.\n\nOn August 7, 2022, a ceasefire was brokered by Egypt, which has played a key role in mediating between Israel and Hamas. The ceasefire held for several days, but was eventually broken when Hamas launched more rockets into Israel.\n\n##Major incidents\n\nThere were several major incidents during the 2022 Gaza–Israel clashes. On August 6, 2022, an Israeli airstrike hit a residential building in Gaza City, killing several civilians. The incident was widely condemned by the international community, and raised concerns about the potential for civilian casualties.\n\nOn August 8, 2022, a Hamas rocket hit a house in the Israeli town of Sderot, injuring several civilians. The incident highlighted the risk of civilian casualties on both sides of the conflict.\n\n#Palestinian rocket failures\n\nDuring the 2022 Gaza–Israel clashes, there were several instances of Palestinian rocket failures. In some cases, rockets launched by Hamas and other militant groups failed to reach their targets in Israel, instead falling short and landing in the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe rocket failures raised concerns about the potential for civilian casualties in the Gaza Strip. In some cases, the failed rockets landed in residential areas, causing damage and injuring civilians.\n\n##Causes of rocket failures\n\nThe causes of the Palestinian rocket failures are not entirely clear. However, it is believed that the failures were due to a combination of factors, including the poor quality of the rockets and the lack of training among the militants launching them.\n\n#Diplomacy\n\nThe 2022 Gaza–Israel clashes highlighted the need for diplomacy to resolve the conflict. The international community called for renewed efforts to achieve a two-state solution, which would see the establishment of an independent Palestinian state alongside the state of Israel.\n\nEgypt played a key role in mediating between Israel and Hamas, brokering a ceasefire that held for several days. The United States, meanwhile, called for calm and restraint, and urged both sides to show restraint.\n\n##International involvement\n\nThe 2022 Gaza–Israel clashes drew in several international actors, including the United Nations, the European Union, and the Arab League. These organizations called for a ceasefire and urged both sides to show restraint.\n\nThe international community also provided humanitarian assistance to the Gaza Strip, including food, medicine, and shelter. The assistance was provided through a variety of channels, including the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA).\n\n#Possible war crimes\n\nThe 2022 Gaza–Israel clashes raised concerns about the potential for war crimes on both sides. The use of force by Israel and the launch of rockets by Hamas were widely condemned by the international community.\n\n##Investigations\n\nThere were several investigations into the 2022 Gaza–Israel clashes, including those conducted by the United Nations and human rights organizations. These investigations found evidence of potential war crimes on both sides, including the use of excessive force by Israel and the launch of indiscriminate rockets by Hamas.\n\n##Prosecution\n\nThere were calls for prosecution of those responsible for potential war crimes during the 2022 Gaza–Israel clashes. The International Criminal Court (ICC) was called upon to investigate the conflict and to prosecute those responsible for war crimes.\n\n#See also\n\n* Gaza–Israel conflict\n* Israeli–Palestinian conflict\n* List of conflicts in the Middle East\n* List of wars involving Israel\n\n#References\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)\n\n#External links\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Gaza–Israel_clashes\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Wider commentary\n#Timeline\n#Palestinian rocket failures\n#Diplomacy\n#Possible war crimes\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The operation was led by a group of Venezuelan exiles and American private military contractors, who attempted to infiltrate the country and overthrow the government of President Nicolás Maduro.\n\n#Background\n\nVenezuela has been embroiled in a severe economic and humanitarian crisis since 2013, which has led to widespread poverty, food shortages, and human rights abuses. The crisis has also led to a significant decline in the legitimacy of the Maduro government, which has been widely criticized for its authoritarian tactics and handling of the economy.\n\nIn 2019, Juan Guaidó, the leader of the Venezuelan opposition, declared himself interim president of the country, with the support of the United States and many other Western governments. Guaidó's claim to the presidency has been recognized by over 50 countries, but Maduro remains in power and retains the support of Russia, China, and other key allies.\n\n#Planning\n\n##Initial promotion: March–May 2019\n\nThe planning for Operation Gideon began in March 2019, when a group of Venezuelan exiles and American private military contractors started promoting the idea of a armed incursion into Venezuela. The group claimed that they had the support of Guaidó and the opposition, and that their goal was to overthrow Maduro and establish a transitional government.\n\n##Colombia Silvercorp established: June 2019\n\nIn June 2019, a private military company called Silvercorp USA was established in Colombia, with the stated goal of providing security services to the Venezuelan opposition. The company was founded by Jordan Goudreau, a former US Army Special Forces operative, and Cliver Alcalá, a former Venezuelan military officer who had defected to the opposition.\n\n##Negotiations with Guaidó representatives: August–November 2019\n\nBetween August and November 2019, representatives of Silvercorp USA held negotiations with Guaidó and his representatives, discussing the possibility of a armed incursion into Venezuela. Guaidó has denied that he gave his explicit approval for the operation, but it is alleged that he provided tacit support and allowed his representatives to discuss the plans with Silvercorp.\n\n##Alcalá and Goudreau resume preparations: December 2019\n\nIn December 2019, Alcalá and Goudreau resumed preparations for the operation, recruiting additional personnel and gathering equipment. The group planned to infiltrate Venezuela by sea, using boats and speedboats to evade the Venezuelan military.\n\n##Extradition of Alcalá to the United States: March 2020\n\nIn March 2020, Alcalá was extradited to the United States to face charges related to a previous plot to overthrow Maduro. However, Goudreau and the rest of the group continued with the plans, allegedly with the support of other Venezuelan exiles and opposition leaders.\n\n###Prior knowledge of operation\n\nIt is alleged that some Venezuelan opposition leaders and US officials had prior knowledge of the operation, although the extent of their involvement is unclear. Guaidó has denied any knowledge of the operation, but some of his representatives have been accused of providing tacit support.\n\n##Final preparations, Associated Press article: April–May 2020\n\nIn April and May 2020, the Associated Press published a series of articles revealing the plans for Operation Gideon, including the involvement of Silvercorp USA and the recruitment of Venezuelan exiles. The articles sparked widespread attention and criticism, with many questioning the wisdom and legality of the operation.\n\n#Landing attempt\n\nOn May 3, 2020, a group of around 60 Venezuelan exiles and American private military contractors, led by Goudreau, attempted to infiltrate Venezuela by sea. The group landed on the coast of the state of La Guaira, near the capital city of Caracas, but were quickly intercepted by the Venezuelan military.\n\nThe Venezuelan military reported that eight of the attackers were killed, including two Americans, and that several others were arrested. The operation was widely condemned as a \"terrorist\" attack, and Maduro accused the United States and the opposition of supporting the plot.\n\n#Aftermath\n\n##Indictments and arrests\n\nIn the aftermath of the operation, several Venezuelan exiles and opposition leaders were indicted and arrested, accused of supporting the plot. Guaidó denied any involvement, but several of his representatives were accused of providing tacit support.\n\n##Criminal charges, extradition requests and sentences\n\nGoudreau and several other Americans involved in the operation were charged with crimes related to the plot, including conspiracy and arms trafficking. The US government has also received extradition requests from Venezuela for several of the accused.\n\n##Investigation of interception and deaths\n\nThe Venezuelan government has launched an investigation into the interception and deaths of the attackers, with Maduro accusing the US of supporting the plot. The US government has denied any involvement, but several lawmakers have called for an investigation into the role of US private military contractors in the operation.\n\n##Goudreau lawsuit\n\nIn June 2020, Goudreau launched a lawsuit against the Venezuelan government, alleging that he had been defrauded by Guaidó and the opposition. The lawsuit claims that Goudreau was promised millions of dollars in funding and support for the operation, but that he was instead left to fund the plot himself.\n\n#Reactions\n\n##Domestic\n\n###Maduro administration\n\nThe Maduro administration has widely condemned the operation, accusing the US and the opposition of supporting the plot. Maduro has also accused several Venezuelan opposition leaders of treason and conspiracy.\n\n###Guaidó administration and opposition\n\nGuaidó has denied any involvement in the operation, but several of his representatives have been accused of providing tacit support. The opposition has widely condemned the operation, accusing Maduro of using it as a pretext to crack down on dissent.\n\n###NGOs\n\nSeveral human rights NGOs have condemned the operation, accusing the attackers of human rights abuses and the Venezuelan military of using excessive force.\n\n##International\n\nThe international community has widely condemned the operation, with several countries calling for an investigation into the role of US private military contractors. The US government has denied any involvement, but several lawmakers have called for an investigation into the plot.\n\n##Characterization\n\nThe operation has been widely characterized as a \"terrorist\" attack and a \"coup\" attempt. However, some have also accused the attackers of being \"mercenaries\" and \"vigilantes\".\n\n#In popular culture\n\nThe operation has been the subject of several books, articles, and documentaries, including a feature-length film in development.\n\n#See also\n\n* Venezuelan presidential crisis\n* Juan Guaidó\n* Nicolás Maduro\n* Operation Condor\n* Iran-Contra affair\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is based on publicly available sources and may not reflect the full complexity of the events described.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Operation_Gideon_(2020)\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Planning\n##Initial promotion: March–May 2019\n##Colombia Silvercorp established: June 2019\n##Negotiations with Guaidó representatives: August–November 2019\n##Alcalá and Goudreau resume preparations: December 2019\n##Extradition of Alcalá to the United States: March 2020\n###Prior knowledge of operation\n##Final preparations, Associated Press article: April–May 2020\n#Landing attempt\n#Aftermath\n##Indictments and arrests\n##Criminal charges, extradition requests and sentences\n##Investigation of interception and deaths\n##Goudreau lawsuit\n#Reactions\n##Domestic\n###Maduro administration\n###Guaidó administration and opposition\n###NGOs\n##International\n##Characterization\n#In popular culture\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n##Bibliography\n###Journal articles\n###Books\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The far-right ideology in Serbia is characterized by ultra-nationalism, anti-communism, and a strong emphasis on Serbian identity and culture. This article provides an overview of the definition, symbolism, influence, and history of far-right politics in Serbia, as well as an examination of the various political groups, individuals, and parties associated with this ideology.\n\nOverview\n--------\n\n### Definition\n\nFar-right politics in Serbia are defined by a radical form of nationalism that emphasizes the superiority of the Serbian nation and the need for a strong, authoritarian state to protect its interests. This ideology is often characterized by a rejection of liberal democracy, multiculturalism, and globalization, and a strong emphasis on traditional values and social conservatism. Far-right politicians in Serbia often use populist rhetoric to mobilize support among the population, particularly among young people and those who feel economically or socially marginalized.\n\n### Symbolism\n\nFar-right groups in Serbia often use symbols and imagery associated with Serbian nationalism, such as the double-headed eagle and the Serbian cross. These symbols are often used to evoke a sense of national pride and to emphasize the group's commitment to Serbian identity. Some far-right groups also use neo-Nazi and white supremacist symbols, such as the swastika and the Celtic cross, although these are not as widely used as nationalist symbols.\n\n### Influence\n\nFar-right politics have had a significant influence on Serbian society and politics, particularly since the 1990s. The rise of far-right groups and politicians has contributed to a climate of intolerance and xenophobia, particularly towards minority groups such as Roma, Muslims, and LGBTQ+ individuals. Far-right politicians have also played a role in shaping Serbia's foreign policy, particularly with regards to its relations with neighboring countries and the European Union.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### Yugoslavia\n\nDuring the interwar period, far-right groups such as the Organization of Yugoslav Nationalists (ORJUNA) and the Yugoslav Radical Union (JRZ) emerged in Yugoslavia. These groups advocated for a strong, centralized state and the suppression of minority groups. After World War II, the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, led by Josip Broz Tito, suppressed far-right groups and imposed a socialist system on the country.\n\n### 1990s–2000s\n\nDuring the 1990s, far-right groups such as the Serbian Radical Party (SRS) and the Obraz movement emerged in Serbia. These groups advocated for a strong, nationalist state and the protection of Serbian interests. The SRS, led by Vojislav Šešelj, became a major player in Serbian politics, and its ideology influenced the policies of the Serbian government during the Yugoslav Wars.\n\n### Contemporary period\n\nIn recent years, far-right groups and politicians have continued to play a significant role in Serbian politics. The rise of populist and nationalist movements across Europe has contributed to a resurgence of far-right ideology in Serbia. Far-right politicians such as Aleksandar Vučić and Miloš Jovanović have used nationalist rhetoric to mobilize support among the population, and far-right groups such as the People's Patrol and the Serbian Action have become increasingly prominent.\n\nPolitical groups\n----------------\n\n### Organisations\n\n#### Blood and Honour\n\nBlood and Honour is a neo-Nazi organization that emerged in Serbia in the 1990s.

The earthquake had a moment magnitude of 7.4 and a maximum intensity of 6+ on the Japanese seismic intensity scale. The quake triggered a tsunami warning and caused widespread damage, power outages, and transportation disruptions in the affected areas.\n\n# Tectonic Setting\n\nThe 2022 Fukushima earthquake occurred in the Pacific Ring of Fire, an area of high seismic activity that encircles the Pacific Ocean. The earthquake was a result of the interaction between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate, which are in a state of subduction. The Pacific Plate is being pushed beneath the North American Plate at a rate of about 9 cm/year, resulting in the buildup of stress in the Earth's crust. This stress was released during the earthquake, causing the ground to shake violently.\n\n# Earthquake\n\nThe earthquake occurred at 23:36 JST on March 16, 2022, with its epicenter located about 40 km off the coast of Fukushima Prefecture. The quake had a focal depth of approximately 35 km and a moment magnitude of 7.4. The earthquake was a result of a reverse faulting mechanism, where the Pacific Plate was pushed beneath the North American Plate.\n\n## Intensity\n\nThe earthquake had a maximum intensity of 6+ on the Japanese seismic intensity scale, which is a measure of the shaking intensity at a particular location. The intensity of the earthquake was strong enough to cause widespread damage, especially in the coastal areas of Fukushima Prefecture.\n\n## Long Period Ground Motion\n\nThe earthquake also generated long period ground motion, which is a type of seismic wave that can cause damage to tall buildings and other structures. The long period ground motion was particularly strong in the Tokyo metropolitan area, where many high-rise buildings are located.\n\n# Tsunami\n\nThe earthquake triggered a tsunami warning, which was issued by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) at 23:40 JST on March 16, 2022. The tsunami warning was issued for the coastal areas of Fukushima Prefecture, as well as other nearby prefectures. The tsunami waves were reported to be around 0.5-1.5 meters high, which is relatively small compared to other tsunamis that have occurred in Japan.\n\n# Impact\n\nThe earthquake and tsunami had a significant impact on the affected areas, causing widespread damage, power outages, and transportation disruptions.\n\n## Schools\n\nMany schools in the affected areas were closed due to the earthquake and tsunami, with some schools suffering damage to their buildings. The Fukushima Prefectural Government reported that over 100 schools were affected, with some schools experiencing power outages and others having damage to their buildings.\n\n## Commercial Business and Industrial Sector\n\nThe earthquake and tsunami also had a significant impact on the commercial business and industrial sector, with many businesses closed due to the disaster. The Fukushima Prefectural Government reported that over 1,000 businesses were affected, with some businesses experiencing power outages and others having damage to their buildings.\n\n## Power Outages\n\nThe earthquake and tsunami caused widespread power outages in the affected areas, with over 100,000 households affected. The power outages were caused by damage to the power grid, as well as by the shutdown of power plants in the area.\n\n## Transportation\n\nThe earthquake and tsunami also caused transportation disruptions, with many roads and railways closed due to the disaster. The Fukushima Prefectural Government reported that over 100 roads were closed, with some roads experiencing damage and others being blocked by debris.\n\n# Casualties\n\nFortunately, there were no reported fatalities directly attributed to the earthquake and tsunami. However, there were reports of injuries, with some people injured by falling objects or other hazards.\n\n# Response\n\nThe response to the earthquake and tsunami was swift, with emergency responders and aid teams quickly dispatched to the affected areas.\n\n## Earthquake and Tsunami Advisory\n\nThe Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) issued an earthquake and tsunami advisory at 23:40 JST on March 16, 2022, which was broadcast on television and radio stations across the country. The advisory warned of the potential for a tsunami and advised people in the affected areas to evacuate immediately.\n\n## Domestic\n\nThe Japanese government quickly responded to the disaster, with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida dispatching a team of officials to the affected areas to assess the damage and provide aid. The government also activated its emergency response system, which includes the deployment of emergency responders and aid teams.\n\n## International\n\nThe international community also responded to the disaster, with many countries offering aid and assistance to Japan. The United States, for example, offered to provide aid and assistance, including the deployment of a team of experts to help with the response efforts.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of earthquakes in Japan\n* List of tsunamis affecting Japan\n* 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami\n\n# References\n\n*Note: References are not included in this article*\n\n# External links\n\n* Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA)\n* Fukushima Prefectural Government\n* Japanese government's disaster response website", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Fukushima_earthquake\" following this outline:\n\n#Tectonic setting\n#Earthquake\n##Intensity\n##Long period ground motion\n#Tsunami\n#Impact\n##Schools\n##Commercial business and industrial sector\n##Power outages\n##Transportation\n#Casualties\n#Response\n##Earthquake and tsunami advisory\n##Domestic\n##International\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The term \"Indiewood\" was coined in the 1990s to describe the emerging trend of independent films being produced and distributed by major studios, thereby blurring the lines between the two. This phenomenon has led to the creation of a new type of film industry, one that combines the creative freedom and innovative spirit of independent filmmaking with the financial resources and marketing muscle of Hollywood's major studios.\n\n#Background\n\nThe independent film movement in the United States has its roots in the 1950s and 1960s, when filmmakers such as John Cassavetes and Stanley Kubrick began producing low-budget, avant-garde films outside of the traditional Hollywood studio system. These filmmakers sought to challenge the conventions of mainstream cinema and create more personal, experimental works.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, the independent film movement gained momentum, with the rise of filmmakers such as Jim Jarmusch, John Waters, and David Lynch. These filmmakers were able to produce and distribute their films independently, often through self-financing and DIY distribution methods.\n\nHowever, it wasn't until the 1990s that the independent film movement began to converge with Hollywood's major studios. This convergence was driven by the success of films such as \"Sex, Lies, and Videotape\" (1989) and \"Clerks\" (1994), which were produced and distributed independently but achieved mainstream success. As a result, major studios began to take notice of the independent film movement and saw an opportunity to tap into its creative energy and innovative spirit.\n\n#Divisions\n\nIndiewood can be divided into several subcategories, including:\n\n* Independent films produced and distributed by major studios, often through specialized subsidiaries or divisions.\n* Independent films produced and distributed by independent companies, which may receive financing and distribution support from major studios.\n* Low-budget, genre-specific films produced and distributed by independent companies, often with the intention of achieving mainstream success.\n\nSome notable examples of Indiewood divisions include:\n\n* Miramax Films, which was founded in 1979 and acquired by Disney in 1993.\n* New Line Cinema, which was founded in 1967 and acquired by Warner Bros. in 1996.\n* Warner Independent Pictures, which was founded in 2003 and folded in 2008.\n\n#Other \"mini-major\" subdivisions/indie distributors\n\nIn addition to the major studios' Indiewood divisions, there are several other \"mini-major\" subdivisions and indie distributors that have emerged in recent years. Some notable examples include:\n\n* A24, which was founded in 2012 and has produced and distributed films such as \"Moonlight\" (2016) and \"Lady Bird\" (2017).\n* Annapurna Pictures, which was founded in 2010 and has produced and distributed films such as \"The Master\" (2012) and \"American Hustle\" (2013).\n* The Weinstein Company, which was founded in 2005 and filed for bankruptcy in 2017.\n\n##Sources\n\nWhile there are no specific sources cited in this article, the information is based on general knowledge and industry trends.\n\n#Differences from Hollywood\n\nIndiewood differs from traditional Hollywood in several key ways, including:\n\n* Budget: Indiewood films are often produced on lower budgets than traditional Hollywood films.\n* Creative control: Indiewood filmmakers often have more creative control over their projects than traditional Hollywood filmmakers.\n* Distribution: Indiewood films are often distributed independently or through specialized subsidiaries, rather than through traditional Hollywood distribution channels.\n* Marketing: Indiewood films are often marketed in a more targeted and grassroots manner than traditional Hollywood films.\n\n#List of selected Indiewood/Pre-Indiewood filmmakers\n\nSome notable Indiewood and Pre-Indiewood filmmakers include:\n\n* Jim Jarmusch\n* John Cassavetes\n* Stanley Kubrick\n* David Lynch\n* John Waters\n* Steven Soderbergh\n* Quentin Tarantino\n* Wes Anderson\n* Sofia Coppola\n\n##List of selected notable and important Pre-Indiewood films\n\n###Pre-1950s\n\n* \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\" (1920)\n* \"Nanook of the North\" (1922)\n* \"The Passion of Joan of Arc\" (1928)\n* \"City Lights\" (1931)\n\n###1950s\n\n* \"Shadows\" (1959)\n* \"The 400 Blows\" (1959)\n\n###1960s\n\n* \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\" (1962)\n* \"The Pawnbroker\" (1964)\n* \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" (1966)\n* \"Bonnie and Clyde\" (1967)\n\n###1970s\n\n* \"The Godfather\" (1972)\n* \"Mean Streets\" (1973)\n* \"Chinatown\" (1974)\n* \"Jaws\" (1975)\n\n##List of notable and important Indiewood films\n\n###1980s\n\n* \"Sex, Lies, and Videotape\" (1989)\n* \"Do the Right Thing\" (1989)\n\n###1990s\n\n* \"Clerks\" (1994)\n* \"Pulp Fiction\" (1994)\n* \"El Mariachi\" (1992)\n* \"The Blair Witch Project\" (1999)\n\n###2000s\n\n* \"Memento\" (2000)\n* \"Mulholland Drive\" (2001)\n* \"The Pianist\" (2002)\n* \"Lost in Translation\" (2003)\n\n###2010s\n\n* \"The Social Network\" (2010)\n* \"The Tree of Life\" (2011)\n* \"Moonrise Kingdom\" (2012)\n* \"12 Years a Slave\" (2013)\n\n###2020s\n\n* \"The Lighthouse\" (2019)\n* \"Parasite\" (2019)\n* \"The Father\" (2020)\n* \"Nomadland\" (2020)\n\n#Notes\n\nWhile this article provides a general overview of Indiewood, it is not exhaustive and there are many other films and filmmakers that could be included.\n\n#See also\n\n* Independent film\n* Hollywood\n* Film industry\n\n#References\n\nNone cited.\n\n#Bibliography\n\nNone cited.\n\n#External links\n\nNone provided.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Indiewood\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Divisions\n#Other \"mini-major\" subdivisions/indie distributors\n##Sources\n#Differences from Hollywood\n#List of selected Indiewood/Pre-Indiewood filmmakers\n##List of selected notable and important Pre-Indiewood films\n###Pre-1950s\n###1950s\n###1960s\n###1970s\n##List of notable and important Indiewood films\n###1980s\n###1990s\n###2000s\n###2010s\n###2020s\n#Notes\n#See also\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This information war is a key component of Russia's broader strategy to exert control over Ukraine and the wider region.\n\n# Background\n\n## Doctrine\n\nThe Russian information war against Ukraine is guided by the doctrine of \"information warfare,\" which emphasizes the use of information as a tool of warfare to achieve strategic objectives. This doctrine was formalized in the 1990s and has since been refined and expanded to incorporate new technologies and tactics.\n\n## Reasons for the conflict\n\n### Revanchism\n\nThe Russian information war against Ukraine is motivated by a desire to reassert Russian dominance over the region and reverse the losses suffered during the collapse of the Soviet Union. This revanchist sentiment is driven by a perception that Ukraine's independence and integration into European and transatlantic structures pose a threat to Russian interests and influence.\n\n### History of the war\n\nThe conflict in Ukraine began in 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and began supporting separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine. Since then, the conflict has evolved into a complex and multifaceted war involving military, economic, and informational components.\n\n# Information operations\n\n## Censorship\n\nRussia has employed censorship as a key tactic in its information war against Ukraine. This has involved blocking access to Ukrainian media outlets, social media platforms, and other online resources deemed hostile to Russian interests.\n\n## Telecommunications\n\nRussia has also sought to disrupt Ukraine's telecommunications infrastructure, including its internet and phone networks. This has involved hacking, jamming, and other forms of interference designed to degrade Ukraine's ability to communicate and access information.\n\n## Internet infrastructure\n\nRussia has invested heavily in developing its own internet infrastructure, including the creation of a national internet backbone and the development of domestic internet services. This has enabled Russia to exert greater control over the flow of information within its borders and to project its influence into neighboring countries.\n\n## War propaganda\n\nRussia has engaged in extensive war propaganda efforts, including the dissemination of false information, conspiracy theories, and other forms of disinformation. This has involved the use of state-controlled media outlets, social media platforms, and other online resources.\n\n## Control of news outlets\n\n### Public relations\n\nRussia has employed public relations firms and other entities to promote its interests and shape public opinion in Ukraine and beyond. This has involved the use of lobbying, advertising, and other forms of influence.\n\n### Ukraine\n\nRussia has sought to exert control over Ukraine's media landscape, including the ownership and editorial control of major news outlets. This has involved the use of proxy owners, shell companies, and other forms of indirect control.\n\n### Russia\n\n#### RT\n\nRussia's state-controlled news outlet, RT (formerly Russia Today), has played a key role in promoting Russian interests and disseminating disinformation. RT has been accused of spreading conspiracy theories, promoting anti-Western sentiment, and engaging in other forms of propaganda.\n\n### Russian interference with Ukrainian media\n\nRussia has interfered with Ukrainian media outlets, including the hacking of news websites, the dissemination of false information, and other forms of disruption. This has involved the use of cyber attacks, propaganda, and other forms of influence.\n\n## Methods and resources\n\n### Disinformation\n\nRussia has employed disinformation as a key tactic in its information war against Ukraine. This has involved the dissemination of false information, conspiracy theories, and other forms of deception.\n\n#### Falsehoods and adamant denials\n\nRussia has repeatedly denied involvement in the conflict in Ukraine, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. This has involved the use of false narratives, conspiracy theories, and other forms of disinformation.\n\n##### 2014\n\nRussia denied involvement in the annexation of Crimea, despite the presence of Russian troops and the use of Russian military equipment.\n\n##### Malaysia Airlines Flight 17\n\nRussia denied involvement in the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, despite evidence that a Russian-made missile was used to shoot down the plane.\n\n##### 2022\n\nRussia denied involvement in the invasion of Ukraine, despite the presence of Russian troops and the use of Russian military equipment.\n\n### Tropes\n\nRussia has employed a range of tropes and cliches in its information war against Ukraine, including the use of anti-Western sentiment, conspiracy theories, and other forms of propaganda.\n\n### Social media\n\nRussia has used social media platforms to promote its interests and disseminate disinformation. This has involved the use of bots, trolls, and other forms of online influence.\n\n#### Access to social media\n\nRussia has sought to restrict access to social media platforms in Ukraine, including the blocking of Facebook, Twitter, and other online resources.\n\n#### Attempts to censor Russian Wikipedia\n\nRussia has attempted to censor Russian Wikipedia, including the removal of articles deemed hostile to Russian interests.\n\n# Timeline\n\n## 2014\n\n### January\n\nThe conflict in Ukraine began in January 2014, with protests in Kiev's Independence Square.\n\n### February\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin ordered the annexation of Crimea in February 2014.\n\n### March\n\nRussia annexed Crimea in March 2014, despite international condemnation.\n\n### April\n\nPro-Russian separatists began taking control of government buildings in eastern Ukraine in April 2014.\n\n### May\n\nUkraine held presidential elections in May 2014, despite ongoing violence in the east.\n\n### June\n\nRussia began supplying separatist rebels with heavy weaponry in June 2014.\n\n### July–August\n\nFighting escalated in eastern Ukraine in July and August 2014, with both sides suffering heavy losses.\n\n### October\n\nRussia began a campaign of cyber attacks against Ukrainian government and military targets in October 2014.\n\n### December\n\nRussia signed a ceasefire agreement with Ukraine in December 2014, but fighting continued.\n\n## 2015\n\n### January\n\nFighting escalated in eastern Ukraine in January 2015, with both sides suffering heavy losses.\n\n### February\n\nRussia and Ukraine signed a new ceasefire agreement in February 2015, but fighting continued.\n\n### March\n\nRussia began a campaign of propaganda and disinformation in March 2015, aimed at shaping public opinion in Ukraine and Europe.\n\n### June\n\nRussia launched a series of cyber attacks against Ukrainian government and military targets in June 2015.\n\n## 2016\n\nFighting continued in eastern Ukraine throughout 2016, with both sides suffering heavy losses.\n\n## 2017\n\nRussia launched a series of cyber attacks against Ukrainian government and military targets in 2017.\n\n## 2018\n\nFighting continued in eastern Ukraine throughout 2018, with both sides suffering heavy losses.\n\n## 2019\n\nRussia launched a series of cyber attacks against Ukrainian government and military targets in 2019.\n\n## 2021\n\nFighting continued in eastern Ukraine throughout 2021, with both sides suffering heavy losses.\n\n## 2022\n\n### January\n\nRussia launched a series of cyber attacks against Ukrainian government and military targets in January 2022.\n\n### February\n\nRussia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, despite international condemnation.\n\n### March\n\nFighting continued in eastern Ukraine throughout March 2022, with both sides suffering heavy losses.\n\n# Staged videos\n\nRussia has used staged videos as a tactic in its information war against Ukraine.

From ancient mythologies to modern-day bestsellers, fantasy has evolved over time, influenced by various social, cultural, and literary movements. This article explores the development of fantasy, from its early roots to the present day, highlighting key milestones, trends, and authors that have shaped the genre.\n\n# Differences between fantasy and earlier fantastic works\n\nFantasy is often distinguished from earlier forms of fantastic literature, such as mythology, folklore, and fairy tales. While these genres share similarities with fantasy, they differ in their purpose, tone, and narrative structure. Mythology and folklore, for example, often served to explain natural phenomena, the creation of the world, or the lives of gods and goddesses. In contrast, fantasy typically involves the creation of entirely new worlds, characters, and storylines, often with no direct connection to real-world mythology or folklore.\n\nFairy tales, on the other hand, are often more closely related to fantasy, as they frequently feature magical elements, supernatural creatures, and imaginary worlds. However, fairy tales tend to be more compact, with a focus on a single narrative thread, whereas fantasy often involves more complex, sprawling storylines and world-building.\n\n# Development of fantasy\n\nThe development of fantasy as a distinct genre can be traced back to several key literary movements and periods.\n\n## Romances\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, the romance genre emerged, characterized by tales of chivalry, adventure, and courtly love. Works such as Sir Thomas Malory's \"Le Morte d'Arthur\" and Chrétien de Troyes's \"Arthurian Romances\" featured magical elements, mythical creatures, and supernatural events, laying the groundwork for later fantasy literature.\n\n## The Enlightenment\n\nThe Enlightenment, which spanned the 17th and 18th centuries, saw a shift towards rationalism and scientific inquiry. As a result, fantasy literature became less prominent, with many writers turning to more realistic, mundane subjects. However, this period also saw the emergence of satirical and utopian fiction, which often incorporated fantastical elements.\n\n## Romanticism\n\nThe Romantic movement, which began in the late 18th century, marked a significant turning point in the development of fantasy. Writers such as Mary Shelley, John Keats, and Percy Bysshe Shelley explored the realm of the imagination, often incorporating supernatural and fantastical elements into their works. This period also saw the rise of Gothic fiction, which frequently featured elements of horror, the supernatural, and fantasy.\n\n# Modern fantasy\n\nModern fantasy, as we know it today, began to take shape in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\n## Pre-Tolkien\n\nDuring this period, writers such as William Morris, George MacDonald, and Lord Dunsany created fantasy works that drew on mythology, folklore, and fairy tales. Morris's \"The Well at the World's End\" (1896) and MacDonald's \"Phantastes\" (1858) are notable examples of fantasy literature from this era.\n\n## Tolkien\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkien's \"The Hobbit\" (1937) and \"The Lord of the Rings\" (1954-1955) are widely regarded as foundational texts of modern fantasy. Tolkien's work drew on Norse and Celtic mythologies, as well as Christian theology, to create a richly detailed and expansive world. His influence on the genre cannot be overstated, and his works remain widely popular and influential to this day.\n\n## Post-Tolkien\n\nThe post-Tolkien era saw the rise of many notable fantasy authors, including C.S. Lewis, Ursula K. Le Guin, and Terry Pratchett. Lewis's \"Chronicles of Narnia\" (1950-1956) and Le Guin's \"Earthsea Cycle\" (1968-1990) are examples of fantasy series that built upon Tolkien's foundation, while Pratchett's \"Discworld\" series (1983-2015) offered a humorous, satirical take on the genre.\n\n# References\n\n## Further reading\n\nFor those interested in exploring the history of fantasy in more depth, the following works are recommended:\n\n* \"The Oxford Handbook of Fantasy Literature\" edited by Edward James and Farah Mendlesohn\n* \"The Cambridge Companion to Fantasy Literature\" edited by Edward James and Farah Mendlesohn\n* \"The Encyclopedia of Fantasy\" edited by John Clute and John Grant\n* \"The A to Z of Fantasy Literature\" by Brian Stableford\n\nThese works provide a comprehensive overview of the fantasy genre, covering its history, themes, and notable authors.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"History_of_fantasy\" following this outline:\n\n#Differences between fantasy and earlier fantastic works\n#Development of fantasy\n##Romances\n##The Enlightenment\n##Romanticism\n#Modern fantasy\n##Pre-Tolkien\n##Tolkien\n##Post-Tolkien\n#References\n##Further reading\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This concept is widely used in various sports, allowing teams to make strategic decisions and adjust their lineups according to the game's progress. The rules and regulations regarding free substitution vary across different sports, and this article aims to provide an overview of the different systems used in various sports.\n\n# Sports that allow free substitution\n\n## Sports that allow unlimited substitution during live play\n\nIn some sports, teams are allowed to make unlimited substitutions during live play, meaning that players can be replaced at any time without any restrictions. This system is commonly used in sports such as:\n\n* Ice hockey: In ice hockey, teams are allowed to make line changes during live play, and players can be replaced at any time.\n* Lacrosse: Lacrosse teams can make unlimited substitutions during live play, allowing for quick changes in the game's momentum.\n* Field hockey: Field hockey teams can make unlimited substitutions during live play, enabling them to adjust their strategy and lineup as needed.\n\nThese sports often require a high level of physical fitness, and the ability to make unlimited substitutions allows teams to keep their players fresh and energized throughout the game.\n\n## Sports that allow unlimited substitutions during stoppages of play only\n\nSome sports allow unlimited substitutions during stoppages of play, such as during timeouts, quarter breaks, or when the ball is out of bounds. This system is commonly used in sports such as:\n\n* Basketball: Basketball teams can make unlimited substitutions during timeouts and quarter breaks, allowing them to adjust their lineup and strategy.\n* Football: Football teams can make unlimited substitutions during timeouts and quarter breaks, enabling them to make strategic decisions and adjust their lineup.\n* Volleyball: Volleyball teams can make unlimited substitutions during timeouts and between sets, allowing them to adjust their lineup and strategy.\n\nThis system allows teams to make strategic decisions and adjust their lineup without disrupting the flow of the game.\n\n# Sports with limited substitution\n\n## Sports that allow a limited number of substitutions\n\nSome sports allow a limited number of substitutions, often with restrictions on the number of players that can be replaced. This system is commonly used in sports such as:\n\n* Soccer: Soccer teams are allowed to make three substitutions per game, with the option to make additional substitutions in the event of injuries.\n* Rugby: Rugby teams are allowed to make seven substitutions per game, with restrictions on the number of players that can be replaced in certain positions.\n* Cricket: Cricket teams are allowed to make a limited number of substitutions, often with restrictions on the number of players that can be replaced in certain positions.\n\nThis system requires teams to carefully manage their substitutions and make strategic decisions about when to replace players.\n\n## Sports that only allow substitution to replace injured players\n\nSome sports only allow substitutions to replace injured players, often with restrictions on the number of players that can be replaced. This system is commonly used in sports such as:\n\n* Tennis: Tennis players can only be replaced in the event of an injury, with the opponent having the option to accept the substitute or continue playing with the injured player.\n* Golf: Golfers can only be replaced in the event of an injury, with the opponent having the option to accept the substitute or continue playing with the injured golfer.\n* Baseball: Baseball teams can only make substitutions to replace injured players, with restrictions on the number of players that can be replaced in certain positions.\n\nThis system prioritizes player safety and allows teams to make strategic decisions about when to replace injured players.\n\n# Sports with mixed or hybrid systems\n\nSome sports use a combination of different substitution systems, often with restrictions on the number of players that can be replaced. This system is commonly used in sports such as:\n\n* Water polo: Water polo teams can make unlimited substitutions during live play, but are restricted to a limited number of substitutions during stoppages of play.\n* Handball: Handball teams can make unlimited substitutions during live play, but are restricted to a limited number of substitutions during stoppages of play.\n* Futsal: Futsal teams can make unlimited substitutions during live play, but are restricted to a limited number of substitutions during stoppages of play.\n\nThis system allows teams to make strategic decisions and adjust their lineup according to the game's progress, while also prioritizing player safety and managing the flow of the game.\n\n# See also\n\n* Substitution (sports)\n* Lineup (sports)\n* Strategy (sports)\n* Tactics (sports)\n\n# Notes\n\nThe rules and regulations regarding free substitution vary across different sports and leagues, and this article aims to provide a general overview of the different systems used in various sports.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Free_substitution\" following this outline:\n\n#Sports that allow free substitution\n##Sports that allow unlimited substitution during live play\n##Sports that allow unlimited substitutions during stoppages of play only\n#Sports with limited substitution\n##Sports that allow a limited number of substitutions\n##Sports that only allow substitution to replace injured players\n#Sports with mixed or hybrid systems\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The strike, which began on July 14, 2023, and lasted for several months, was the largest labor action in the entertainment industry since the 2007-2008 Writers Guild of America strike.\n\n# Background\n\nThe 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike was the culmination of years of tensions between the union and the AMPTP over issues such as compensation, benefits, and working conditions.\n\n## Unionization in Hollywood\n\nThe entertainment industry has a long history of unionization, dating back to the 1920s. The Screen Actors Guild (SAG) was founded in 1933, and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA) was established in 1937. The two unions merged in 2012 to form SAG-AFTRA, which represents over 160,000 film and television actors, journalists, radio personalities, recording artists, and other media professionals.\n\n## Pre-strike activity\n\nIn the months leading up to the strike, SAG-AFTRA engaged in a series of negotiations with the AMPTP, but the two sides were unable to reach an agreement. The union was seeking increased compensation for its members, including higher residuals for streaming content, as well as improvements in working conditions and benefits. The AMPTP, on the other hand, was pushing for greater flexibility in its contracts with the union, including the ability to produce more content without the need for union approval.\n\n# Timeline\n\nThe 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike was a complex and multifaceted labor action that unfolded over several months.\n\n## July\n\nThe strike began on July 14, 2023, with pickets outside major film and television studios in Los Angeles and New York City. SAG-AFTRA members were joined on the picket lines by supporters from other unions, including the Writers Guild of America (WGA) and the Directors Guild of America (DGA).\n\n## August\n\nIn August, the strike expanded to include other locations, including Chicago and Atlanta. The union also began to target specific productions, including the popular television show \"Saturday Night Live,\" which was forced to go into reruns due to the strike.\n\n## September\n\nIn September, the AMPTP proposed a new contract that included some concessions to the union, but SAG-AFTRA rejected the offer, saying that it did not go far enough to address the union's concerns.\n\n## October\n\nIn October, the strike began to have a major impact on the entertainment industry, with many productions shutting down or being delayed due to the lack of union talent. The union also began to target streaming services, including Netflix and Amazon Prime, which were seen as major contributors to the decline of traditional television viewing.\n\n## November\n\nIn November, the strike entered its fifth month, with no end in sight. The union and the AMPTP continued to negotiate, but the two sides remained far apart on many key issues.\n\n## December\n\nIn December, the strike finally came to an end, with the union and the AMPTP reaching a tentative agreement on a new contract. The agreement included many of the concessions that the union had been seeking, including higher residuals for streaming content and improvements in working conditions and benefits.\n\n# Strike activity and responses\n\nThe 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike was marked by a range of activities and responses from different groups.\n\n## Locations\n\nThe strike took place in many different locations, including Los Angeles, New York City, Chicago, and Atlanta. The union set up picket lines outside major film and television studios, as well as outside specific productions that were targeted by the strike.\n\n## Media executives' response\n\nMedia executives were largely critical of the strike, saying that it was unnecessary and would harm the entertainment industry. Many executives also argued that the union's demands were unreasonable and would lead to increased costs for producers.\n\n## Politicians' response\n\nPoliticians were divided in their response to the strike, with some supporting the union and others supporting the AMPTP. Many Democrats, including Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, came out in support of the union, while many Republicans, including Senator Ted Cruz and Representative Kevin McCarthy, opposed the strike.\n\n## Other unions' response\n\nOther unions in the entertainment industry, including the WGA and the DGA, came out in support of SAG-AFTRA. Many of these unions also engaged in solidarity actions, including joining SAG-AFTRA members on the picket lines.\n\n## Other organizations' response\n\nOther organizations, including the AFL-CIO and the National Organization for Women, also came out in support of the strike. Many of these organizations saw the strike as an important labor action that would benefit not just SAG-AFTRA members, but also workers in other industries.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike had a major impact on the entertainment industry, with many productions shutting down or being delayed due to the lack of union talent. The strike also had a significant impact on the economy, with estimates suggesting that it cost the industry billions of dollars.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe aftermath of the strike was marked by a range of developments, including the implementation of the new contract and the return of SAG-AFTRA members to work.\n\n# See also\n\n* 2007-2008 Writers Guild of America strike\n* 2016-2017 video game voice actor strike\n* Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers\n* Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a general overview of the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike.
