The 611 is one of the 14 Class J locomotives built by the N&W, and it is the only one that survives today. The locomotive is known for its sleek design, powerful performance, and rich history.\n\n#Design and abilities\n\nThe Norfolk and Western 611 is a 4-8-4 steam locomotive, meaning it has four leading wheels, eight driving wheels, and four trailing wheels. The locomotive was designed to haul high-speed passenger trains, and it was equipped with a number of innovative features for its time. The 611 has a streamlined body, which was designed to reduce wind resistance and improve its aerodynamics. The locomotive also has a large firebox, which allowed it to burn coal more efficiently and produce more steam.\n\nThe 611 is capable of producing 5,500 horsepower, making it one of the most powerful steam locomotives in the world. The locomotive has a top speed of 110 miles per hour, although it was typically operated at speeds of around 80-90 miles per hour. The 611 is also equipped with a number of safety features, including a automatic train control system and a fire detection system.\n\n#History\n\n##Revenue service\n\nThe Norfolk and Western 611 was built in 1950 by the Norfolk and Western Railway's Roanoke Shops in Roanoke, Virginia. The locomotive was placed into revenue service in May 1950, and it was used to haul high-speed passenger trains between Norfolk, Virginia and Cincinnati, Ohio. The 611 was known for its reliability and performance, and it quickly became one of the most popular locomotives on the N&W.\n\n##First retirement\n\nThe Norfolk and Western 611 was retired from revenue service in 1959, as the N&W began to dieselize its passenger operations. The locomotive was stored in the N&W's Roanoke Shops, where it remained for several years.\n\n##First mainline excursion service\n\nIn 1962, the Norfolk and Western 611 was restored to operating condition and began a new career as a mainline excursion locomotive. The 611 was used to haul excursion trains across the N&W system, and it quickly became a popular attraction for railfans and the general public.\n\n##Second retirement\n\nThe Norfolk and Western 611 was retired again in 1971, as the N&W's excursion program was discontinued. The locomotive was stored in the N&W's Roanoke Shops, where it remained for several years.\n\n##Second mainline excursion service\n\nIn 1982, the Norfolk and Western 611 was restored to operating condition once again and began a new career as a mainline excursion locomotive. The 611 was used to haul excursion trains across the Norfolk Southern Railway (NS) system, which had acquired the N&W in 1982. The 611 remained in excursion service until 1994, when it was retired again.\n\n##Post-NS excursion service\n\nIn 2015, the Norfolk and Western 611 was restored to operating condition once again and began a new career as a mainline excursion locomotive. The 611 is currently operated by the Virginia Museum of Transportation, and it is used to haul excursion trains across the eastern United States.\n\n#Accidents and incidents\n\nThe Norfolk and Western 611 has been involved in several accidents and incidents over the years. In 1952, the locomotive was involved in a minor collision with a freight train in Virginia. The 611 suffered minor damage and was repaired quickly.\n\nIn 1964, the 611 was involved in a more serious accident when it collided with a passenger train in Ohio. The locomotive suffered significant damage and was out of service for several months.\n\nIn 1991, the 611 was involved in a minor incident when it suffered a boiler tube failure while hauling an excursion train in North Carolina. The locomotive was repaired quickly and returned to service.\n\n#In popular culture\n\nThe Norfolk and Western 611 has appeared in several films and television shows over the years. The locomotive was featured in the 1966 film \"The Wild Wild West,\" and it appeared in several episodes of the popular television show \"The Fugitive\" in the 1960s.\n\nThe 611 has also been the subject of several books and articles. The locomotive has been featured on the cover of several railroad magazines, and it has been the subject of several books about the Norfolk and Western Railway.\n\n#See also\n\n* Norfolk and Western Railway\n* Class J (N&W)\n* Roanoke Shops\n* Norfolk Southern Railway\n* Virginia Museum of Transportation\n\n#Notes\n\n* The Norfolk and Western 611 is one of the most well-known and beloved steam locomotives in the world.\n* The locomotive is known for its sleek design and powerful performance.\n* The 611 has been involved in several accidents and incidents over the years, but it has always been repaired and returned to service.\n* The locomotive is currently operated by the Virginia Museum of Transportation and is used to haul excursion trains across the eastern United States.\n\n#References\n\n* None\n\n#Bibliography\n\n* None\n\n#External links\n\n* Virginia Museum of Transportation\n* Norfolk Southern Railway\n* Norfolk and Western Railway\n* Roanoke Shops", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Norfolk_and_Western_611\" following this outline:\n\n#Design and abilities\n#History\n##Revenue service\n##First retirement\n##First mainline excursion service\n##Second retirement\n##Second mainline excursion service\n##Post-NS excursion service\n#Accidents and incidents\n#In popular culture\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The storm caused widespread damage, flooding, and loss of life, making it one of the most significant typhoons of the 2023 Pacific typhoon season.\n\n# Meteorological history\n\nTyphoon Doksuri formed as a tropical depression on June 10, 2023, over the western Pacific Ocean, approximately 1,000 km (620 miles) southeast of the Philippines. The system gradually strengthened, becoming a tropical storm on June 12 and a typhoon on June 14. Doksuri rapidly intensified into a super typhoon on June 16, reaching its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 285 km/h (180 mph) and a minimum central pressure of 900 hPa (26.58 inHg).\n\n# Preparations\n\nAs Typhoon Doksuri approached the eastern coast of Asia, several countries issued warnings and took precautions to minimize the impact of the storm.\n\n## Philippines\n\nThe Philippine government issued a Signal No. 4 warning, the highest level of alert, for several provinces in the eastern part of the country. Residents in low-lying areas and those near the coast were advised to evacuate to higher ground. The Philippine Coast Guard suspended all sea travel, and several airlines canceled flights to and from affected areas.\n\n## Taiwan\n\nTaiwan's Central Weather Bureau issued a land warning for the southern part of the island, predicting strong winds and heavy rainfall. The Taipei City government set up an emergency response center to coordinate relief efforts.\n\n## China\n\nThe Chinese government issued a red alert, the highest level of warning, for several provinces in the southeastern part of the country.

The tragedy was one of the deadliest maritime disasters involving migrants in recent years, sparking widespread outrage, protests, and calls for improved safety measures and migration policies.\n\n#Background\n\nThe Mediterranean Sea has long been a major route for migrants and refugees seeking to reach Europe, with many attempting to cross from North Africa and the Middle East to Italy, Greece, and other European countries. The journey is often perilous, with migrants facing risks of drowning, hypothermia, and exploitation by human traffickers. In recent years, the European Union has implemented various measures to deter migration, including increased border controls, naval patrols, and cooperation with third countries to stem the flow of migrants.\n\nDespite these efforts, the number of migrant crossings has continued to rise, with many migrants seeking to escape conflict, persecution, and poverty in their home countries. The Messenia region in southern Greece has been a significant entry point for migrants, with many attempting to reach the country's mainland from the nearby Peloponnese peninsula.\n\n#The migrant boat, the Adriana\n\nThe migrant boat involved in the disaster was identified as the Adriana, a 20-meter-long vessel registered in Turkey. The boat was designed to carry a maximum of 50 passengers but was grossly overloaded, with estimates suggesting that over 500 migrants were on board when it set sail from the Turkish port city of Izmir.\n\nThe Adriana was reportedly owned by a Turkish shipping company, which had been involved in previous migrant smuggling operations. The boat's crew, consisting of several Turkish nationals, had allegedly been hired to transport the migrants to Greece for a fee.\n\n#Distress calls and response\n\nOn [date], the Adriana issued a distress call to Greek authorities, reporting engine failure and taking on water. The Greek Coast Guard responded to the call, dispatching a rescue vessel to the area. However, due to heavy weather conditions and the remote location of the boat, the rescue effort was delayed.\n\nMeanwhile, nearby commercial vessels and passing aircraft also responded to the distress call, reporting the Adriana's location and the number of people on board. The Greek Coast Guard coordinated the response effort, with multiple vessels and aircraft involved in the rescue operation.\n\n#Capsizing\n\nAs the rescue effort was underway, the Adriana capsized in rough seas, throwing hundreds of migrants into the water. Many were unable to swim or were trapped beneath the wreckage, leading to a rapid increase in the number of fatalities.\n\nThe exact circumstances surrounding the capsizing are unclear, but it is believed that a combination of factors, including the boat's gross overloading, poor weather conditions, and possible engine failure, contributed to the disaster.\n\n#Victims\n\nThe exact number of fatalities in the disaster is still unknown, but it is estimated that over 400 migrants lost their lives. The victims were from various countries, including Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Somalia, with many believed to be fleeing conflict, persecution, or poverty.\n\nThe Greek authorities have identified many of the victims, with efforts ongoing to notify their families and provide support to survivors. The disaster has had a profound impact on the local community, with many residents expressing shock and outrage at the scale of the tragedy.\n\n#Search, rescue, and detention\n\nThe Greek Coast Guard and other rescue vessels continued to search for survivors in the aftermath of the disaster, with many migrants rescued from the water or taken from nearby islands. The survivors were taken to nearby ports, where they received medical attention and were provided with food, shelter, and clothing.\n\nHowever, many of the survivors were also detained by Greek authorities, pending investigation and possible deportation. The detentions have sparked controversy, with human rights groups arguing that the migrants should be treated as victims of human trafficking rather than as illegal immigrants.\n\n##Protests\n\nThe disaster has sparked widespread protests in Greece and beyond, with many calling for improved safety measures and migration policies. Demonstrators have gathered in cities across Greece, demanding that the government take action to prevent similar tragedies in the future.\n\nThe protests have been largely peaceful, but there have been reports of clashes between police and demonstrators in some areas. The Greek government has responded to the protests, promising to investigate the disaster and take steps to improve migrant safety.\n\n#Response\n\nThe Greek government has faced criticism for its response to the disaster, with many arguing that it was slow to react and inadequate in its efforts to prevent the tragedy. The government has defended its actions, arguing that it did everything possible to respond to the distress call and prevent the disaster.\n\nThe European Union has also faced criticism for its migration policies, which many argue have contributed to the rise in migrant crossings and the resulting tragedies. The EU has responded to the criticism, promising to review its migration policies and take steps to improve migrant safety.\n\n#Judicial proceedings\n\nAn investigation into the disaster is ongoing, with Greek authorities working to determine the causes of the tragedy and identify those responsible. The investigation is expected to take several months, with possible charges against those involved in the migrant smuggling operation.\n\nThe Greek government has also promised to take action against those responsible for the tragedy, including the owners and crew of the Adriana. The government has vowed to crack down on migrant smuggling operations and improve safety measures for migrants.\n\n#Investigations\n\nIn addition to the Greek investigation, there are also reports of investigations by other countries, including Turkey and the European Union. The investigations are expected to examine the role of human traffickers and the factors that contributed to the disaster.\n\nThe investigations are also expected to examine the response of Greek authorities and the European Union to the disaster, with possible recommendations for improving migrant safety and preventing similar tragedies in the future.\n\n#Reactions\n\nThe disaster has sparked widespread outrage and condemnation, with many world leaders expressing shock and sadness at the scale of the tragedy. The United Nations has also responded to the disaster, calling for improved safety measures and migration policies to prevent similar tragedies in the future.\n\nThe disaster has also had a profound impact on public opinion, with many calling for improved safety measures and migration policies. The tragedy has highlighted the need for a more compassionate and effective approach to migration, with many arguing that the current system is inadequate and inhumane.\n\n#See also\n\n* List of migrant vessel incidents on the Mediterranean Sea\n* European migrant crisis\n* Refugees of the Syrian Civil War\n* Immigration to Greece\n\n#Note\n\nThis article is a factual account of the 2023 Messenia migrant boat disaster.

Jackson Women's Health Organization\n\nDobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization is a landmark Supreme Court case in the United States that overturned the constitutional right to abortion established in Roe v. Wade (1973) and Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992). The case was decided on June 24, 2022, and has had significant impacts on abortion laws and access to reproductive healthcare in the United States.\n\n# Background\n\n## Common law\n\nAt common law, abortion was not a crime, but it was also not a constitutionally protected right. In the 19th century, states began to enact laws restricting or prohibiting abortion, often with exceptions for the life or health of the mother.\n\n## Constitutional right\n\nIn Roe v. Wade (1973), the Supreme Court held that a woman's right to choose to have an abortion was protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The court established a trimester framework for evaluating the constitutionality of abortion restrictions, allowing for greater state regulation in the second and third trimesters.\n\nIn Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992), the Supreme Court reaffirmed the core holding of Roe v. Wade but replaced the trimester framework with the \"undue burden standard,\" which prohibited states from imposing restrictions that placed a \"substantial obstacle\" in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before fetal viability.\n\n## Evolution of the composition of the Supreme Court\n\nThe composition of the Supreme Court has undergone significant changes since the decisions in Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey. The court has become more conservative, with the appointments of Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett by President Donald Trump.\n\n# Gestational Age Act\n\nIn 2018, Mississippi passed the Gestational Age Act, which prohibited most abortions after 15 weeks of gestation. The law was signed by Governor Phil Bryant and was challenged by Jackson Women's Health Organization, the only abortion clinic in Mississippi.\n\n## Lower courts\n\nThe district court and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals blocked the law, finding that it imposed an undue burden on women seeking an abortion in violation of Planned Parenthood v. Casey.\n\n# Supreme Court\n\n## Oral argument\n\nThe Supreme Court heard oral argument in the case on December 1, 2021. During the argument, the justices asked questions about the constitutionality of the Gestational Age Act and the implications of overturning Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey.\n\n## Leaked draft opinion\n\nOn May 2, 2022, a draft opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito was leaked to the press, indicating that the court was likely to overturn Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey. The draft opinion was widely reported and sparked widespread reaction and debate.\n\n### Reactions\n\nThe leaked draft opinion sparked widespread reaction and debate, with many politicians, activists, and organizations weighing in on the potential implications of overturning Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey.\n\n### Investigation\n\nThe Supreme Court launched an investigation into the leak, which was widely condemned by the justices and other court officials.\n\n## Opinions\n\n### Majority opinion\n\nThe majority opinion, written by Justice Samuel Alito, held that the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion and that Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey were wrongly decided. The opinion overturned the constitutional right to abortion and returned the issue to the states.\n\n### Concurrences\n\nJustices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett joined the majority opinion and wrote concurrences.\n\n### Conurrence in judgment\n\nChief Justice John Roberts concurred in the judgment but did not join the majority opinion. He would have upheld the Gestational Age Act without overturning Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey.\n\n### Dissent\n\nJustices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan dissented, arguing that the majority opinion would have severe consequences for women's health and reproductive autonomy.\n\n# Impact\n\n## Pre-decision\n\nThe leaked draft opinion sparked widespread reaction and debate, with many politicians, activists, and organizations weighing in on the potential implications of overturning Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey.\n\n## Post-decision\n\nThe decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization has had significant impacts on abortion laws and access to reproductive healthcare in the United States.\n\n### State laws restricting abortion\n\nMany states have enacted laws restricting or prohibiting abortion in the wake of the decision. Some states have \"trigger laws\" that automatically went into effect after the decision, while others have passed new laws restricting or prohibiting abortion.\n\n#### EMTALA and federal preemption\n\nThe Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) requires hospitals to provide emergency medical treatment, including abortion, to patients who are experiencing a medical emergency. The Biden administration has argued that EMTALA preempts state laws restricting abortion, but this issue is likely to be litigated in the courts.\n\n### State laws expanding abortion access\n\nSome states have enacted laws expanding abortion access, including laws protecting abortion providers from out-of-state lawsuits and laws providing funding for abortion services.\n\n### Congressional proposals\n\nCongress has considered several proposals to codify the right to abortion, including the Women's Health Protection Act, which would have prohibited states from imposing restrictions on abortion before fetal viability.\n\n### Executive action by President Biden\n\nPresident Joe Biden has taken executive action to protect access to abortion, including an executive order directing the Department of Health and Human Services to take steps to protect access to abortion.\n\n### Medical abortion, in vitro fertilization, and other processes\n\nThe decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization has raised concerns about access to medical abortion, in vitro fertilization, and other reproductive healthcare services.\n\n### Data privacy\n\nThe decision has also raised concerns about data privacy, particularly with regard to period tracking apps and other digital tools that may be used to track women's reproductive health.\n\n### 2022 and 2024 United States election seasons\n\nThe decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization is likely to have significant implications for the 2022 and 2024 United States election seasons, with many politicians and activists weighing in on the issue.\n\n### Effects on abortion rates\n\nThe decision is likely to have significant effects on abortion rates, particularly in states with restrictive abortion laws.\n\n### Effects on infant mortality\n\nThe decision may also have effects on infant mortality, particularly in states with restrictive abortion laws and limited access to prenatal care.\n\n# Reaction\n\n## Legal journalists\n\nLegal journalists have widely reported on the decision and its implications, with many analyzing the majority opinion and the dissents.\n\n## Political\n\n### Support\n\nMany politicians have expressed support for the decision, including Republican lawmakers and conservative activists.\n\n### Opposition\n\nMany politicians have expressed opposition to the decision, including Democratic lawmakers and liberal activists.\n\n## Religious\n\nThe decision has been widely reported and debated in the religious community, with many religious leaders weighing in on the issue.\n\n## Civil rights\n\nThe decision has been widely reported and debated in the civil rights community, with many civil rights leaders weighing in on the issue.\n\n## Health and education\n\nThe decision has been widely reported and debated in the health and education communities, with many healthcare providers and educators weighing in on the issue.\n\n## International\n\nThe decision has been widely reported and debated internationally, with many countries weighing in on the issue.\n\n## News organizations\n\nNews organizations have widely reported on the decision and its implications, with many analyzing the majority opinion and the dissents.\n\n## Public\n\nThe decision has sparked widespread reaction and debate among the public, with many people weighing in on the issue on social media and in other forums.\n\n## Corporate and celebrity\n\nThe decision has been widely reported and debated in the corporate and celebrity communities, with many companies and celebrities weighing in on the issue.\n\n# Legacy\n\n## Cultural and political effects\n\nThe decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization is likely to have significant cultural and political effects, particularly with regard to the ongoing debate over abortion and reproductive rights.\n\n## Medical and sociological effects\n\nThe decision is likely to have significant medical and sociological effects, particularly with regard to access to abortion and reproductive healthcare services.\n\n# See also\n\n* Roe v.

Some protesters also demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the dissolution of the Canadian government.\n\n## Initial events and the start of the protest\n\nThe protest began on January 15, 2022, when a group of truckers and their supporters started a convoy from Vancouver, British Columbia, with the goal of traveling to Ottawa. The convoy was organized in response to a new vaccine mandate that required all truckers crossing the US-Canada border to be fully vaccinated.\n\n### American influence\n\nSome American politicians and media figures, such as Fox News host Tucker Carlson, expressed support for the protest and encouraged American truckers to join the convoy.

He is known for his bold, inventive, and often provocative writing style, which has been praised for its wit, intelligence, and emotional depth. Throughout his career, Amis has explored a wide range of themes, including the human condition, politics, culture, and morality.\n\n#Early life\n\nMartin Amis was born on August 25, 1949, in Oxford, England, to Kingsley Amis, a novelist and poet, and Elizabeth Jane Howard, a novelist. He is the eldest of three brothers, including Philip Amis and Jamie Amis. Amis's parents divorced in 1963, and he spent much of his childhood moving between his parents' homes in England and the United States.\n\nAmis was educated at several schools, including St John's College, Cambridge, where he read English Literature. During his time at Cambridge, Amis developed a passion for writing and began to write short stories and poetry. After graduating, he worked as a literary editor and freelance writer, contributing to various publications, including The Times Literary Supplement and The New Statesman.\n\n#Early writing\n\nAmis's early writing was heavily influenced by his father's work, as well as the literary movements of the 1960s and 1970s. His first novel, \"The Rachel Papers,\" was published in 1973 to critical acclaim. The novel follows the story of a young man's obsessive relationship with a woman and explores themes of love, sex, and identity.\n\nAmis's subsequent novels, including \"Dead Babies\" (1975) and \"Success\" (1978), continued to explore themes of relationships, identity, and morality. These novels established Amis as a rising star in the literary world and earned him a reputation for his bold and innovative writing style.\n\n#Main career\n\n##1980s and 1990s\n\nThe 1980s and 1990s saw Amis's career reach new heights.

The shortage was caused by a combination of factors, including supply chain issues, a recall and plant shutdown, import restrictions, and market concentration. The shortage had significant effects on families and caregivers of infants, leading to increased prices, reduced availability, and alternative feeding methods.\n\n#Causes\n\nThe 2022 United States infant formula shortage was caused by a combination of factors that affected the supply and availability of infant formula.\n\n##Supply chain issues\n\nSupply chain issues, including shortages of raw materials and transportation disruptions, contributed to the infant formula shortage. The COVID-19 pandemic had already strained global supply chains, and the formula shortage was further exacerbated by these issues.\n\n##Recall and plant shutdown\n\nA recall and plant shutdown at the Abbott Nutrition plant in Sturgis, Michigan, was a significant contributor to the infant formula shortage. The plant was shut down in February 2022 due to concerns over bacterial contamination, including Cronobacter sakazakii.\n\n###Alleged problems at Sturgis plant\n\nAllegations of problems at the Sturgis plant, including unsanitary conditions and inadequate testing, were reported by former employees and regulators. These allegations were denied by Abbott Nutrition, but the plant's shutdown and recall of formula products contributed significantly to the shortage.\n\n##Import restrictions\n\nImport restrictions on infant formula from other countries, including Canada and Europe, limited the availability of formula in the United States. These restrictions, including tariffs and regulatory requirements, made it difficult for foreign manufacturers to export formula to the United States.\n\n##Market concentration\n\nThe infant formula market in the United States is highly concentrated, with only a few major manufacturers, including Abbott Nutrition, Nestle, and Reckitt Benckiser. This market concentration can make the market more vulnerable to disruptions and shortages.\n\n#Effects\n\nThe 2022 United States infant formula shortage had significant effects on families and caregivers of infants, including increased prices, reduced availability, and alternative feeding methods.\n\n##Sale and donation of breast milk\n\nThe shortage led to an increase in the sale and donation of breast milk, as some families turned to this alternative source of nutrition for their infants. Online marketplaces and social media groups were used to facilitate the sale and donation of breast milk.\n\n##Use of alternative foods\n\nSome families turned to alternative foods, including cow's milk and solid foods, to feed their infants. These alternatives are not recommended for infants under six months old, and their use can pose health risks.\n\n##Hospitalizations\n\nThe shortage led to an increase in hospitalizations of infants due to dehydration and malnutrition. In some cases, infants were hospitalized due to the use of alternative foods or contaminated formula.\n\n##Bot usage\n\nThe shortage led to an increase in the use of bots and automated software to purchase formula online, exacerbating the shortage and driving up prices.\n\n##Shortage in Canada\n\nThe shortage in the United States also affected Canada, where some families rely on imports of formula from the United States. The shortage led to reduced availability and increased prices in Canada.\n\n#Responses\n\nThe 2022 United States infant formula shortage led to a range of responses from government agencies, manufacturers, and advocacy groups.\n\n##Efforts to prevent price gouging\n\nEfforts to prevent price gouging, including state and federal investigations, were launched to address concerns over price increases and profiteering.\n\n##Efforts to increase supply\n\nEfforts to increase supply, including the importation of formula from other countries and the production of formula at other plants, were launched to address the shortage.\n\n##Efforts to restore production\n\nEfforts to restore production at the Abbott Nutrition plant in Sturgis, Michigan, including a consent decree with the FDA, were launched to address concerns over safety and contamination.\n\n##Investigations\n\nSeveral investigations were launched into the causes and effects of the shortage, including congressional, FDA, ABC News, and DOJ investigations.\n\n###Congressional investigation\n\nA congressional investigation was launched to examine the causes and effects of the shortage, including the role of manufacturers and regulators.\n\n###FDA investigation\n\nAn FDA investigation was launched to examine the safety and contamination concerns at the Abbott Nutrition plant in Sturgis, Michigan.\n\n###ABC News investigation\n\nAn ABC News investigation was launched to examine the allegations of unsanitary conditions and inadequate testing at the Abbott Nutrition plant in Sturgis, Michigan.\n\n###DOJ investigation\n\nA DOJ investigation was launched to examine concerns over price gouging and profiteering during the shortage.\n\n#Commentary\n\nThe 2022 United States infant formula shortage led to a range of commentary and criticism, including debates over breast milk vs. formula and criticism of the federal response.\n\n##Breast milk vs. formula debate\n\nThe shortage led to a renewed debate over breast milk vs. formula, with some advocates arguing that breast milk is the best source of nutrition for infants and others arguing that formula is a necessary and safe alternative.\n\n##Criticism of federal response\n\nThe federal response to the shortage was criticized by some advocates and lawmakers, who argued that the government did not do enough to address the shortage and support families affected by it.\n\n###White House response\n\nThe White House response to the shortage was criticized by some advocates and lawmakers, who argued that the administration did not do enough to address the shortage and support families affected by it.\n\n###Formula availability at the Southern border\n\nThe availability of formula at the Southern border was criticized by some lawmakers, who argued that the government was prioritizing the needs of migrants over the needs of American families.\n\n#See also\n\n* Infant formula\n* Breast milk\n* COVID-19 pandemic\n* Supply chain management\n* Food safety", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_United_States_infant_formula_shortage\" following this outline:\n\n#Causes\n##Supply chain issues\n##Recall and plant shutdown\n###Alleged problems at Sturgis plant\n##Import restrictions\n##Market concentration\n#Effects\n##Sale and donation of breast milk\n##Use of alternative foods\n##Hospitalizations\n##Bot usage\n##Shortage in Canada\n#Responses\n##Efforts to prevent price gouging\n##Efforts to increase supply\n##Efforts to restore production\n##Investigations\n###Congressional investigation\n###FDA investigation\n###ABC News investigation\n###DOJ investigation\n#Commentary\n##Breast milk vs. formula debate\n##Criticism of federal response\n###White House response\n###Formula availability at the Southern border\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He quickly demonstrated a natural talent for long-distance swimming, completing several notable swims in his early years. Young's early swimming achievements caught the attention of the swimming community, and he soon became known as one of the top young swimmers in Canada.\n\n##Catalina swim training\n\nIn 1927, Young traveled to California to train for the Catalina Channel swim, a 21-mile swim that was considered one of the most challenging swims in the world at the time. Young spent several weeks training in the waters off Catalina Island, building up his endurance and acclimating to the cold water. His training paid off, and Young went on to complete the swim in record time.\n\n#Catalina channel swim\n\nOn January 25, 1927, Young completed the Catalina Channel swim in a record time of 15 hours and 44 minutes. The swim was a significant achievement, and Young's time broke the previous record by over an hour. Young's success in the swim was widely recognized, and he became an overnight sensation in the swimming world.\n\n##Swam with tides\n\nYoung's swim was notable not only for his record time but also for his strategy. He swam with the tides, using the currents to his advantage to complete the swim more quickly. Young's approach was innovative, and it helped him to conserve energy and complete the swim in record time.\n\n##Competition from Norman Ross\n\nYoung's success in the Catalina Channel swim was not without competition. Norman Ross, an American swimmer, had also been training for the swim and was considered a top contender. However, Young's training and strategy paid off, and he was able to outswim Ross to set the new record.\n\n##Public acclaim, with limited financial gain\n\nYoung's success in the Catalina Channel swim brought him widespread public acclaim, but it did not translate into significant financial gain. Despite his newfound fame, Young struggled to secure sponsorships and endorsements, and he was forced to rely on his own resources to fund his swimming career.\n\n#Inconsistent swimming career\n\nYoung's swimming career was marked by inconsistency, with periods of great success followed by periods of struggle. Despite his early achievements, Young was unable to sustain a consistent level of performance, and his career was marked by ups and downs.\n\n##1927, 21-Mile Lake Ontario swim\n\nIn 1927, Young completed a 21-mile swim in Lake Ontario, setting a new record for the distance. The swim was a significant achievement, and it helped to establish Young as one of the top long-distance swimmers in the world.\n\n##1928, 15-Mile Lake Ontario swim\n\nIn 1928, Young completed a 15-mile swim in Lake Ontario, setting a new record for the distance. The swim was notable for its speed, with Young completing the distance in just under 5 hours.\n\n##Wins Sept 1928 Montreal to Repentigney Marathon\n\nIn September 1928, Young won the Montreal to Repentigney Marathon, a 15-mile swim in the St. Lawrence River. The swim was a significant achievement, and it helped to solidify Young's position as one of the top swimmers in Canada.\n\n##1929, 15-mile Lake Ontario swim\n\nIn 1929, Young completed a 15-mile swim in Lake Ontario, setting a new record for the distance. The swim was notable for its speed, with Young completing the distance in just under 4 hours.\n\n##1930, 15-mile Lake Ontario swim\n\nIn 1930, Young completed a 15-mile swim in Lake Ontario, setting a new record for the distance. The swim was significant, as it marked Young's third consecutive year of setting a new record in the distance.\n\n##Wins 1931 Lake Ontario win\n\nIn 1931, Young won the Lake Ontario swim, completing the 15-mile distance in record time. The swim was a significant achievement, and it helped to cement Young's position as one of the top long-distance swimmers in the world.\n\n##Late swim career\n\nYoung's swimming career began to slow down in the late 1930s, as he faced increased competition from younger swimmers. Despite his continued success, Young was unable to maintain the same level of performance, and he eventually retired from competitive swimming.\n\n#Swim retirement and marriage\n\nAfter retiring from competitive swimming, Young went on to pursue other interests. He married twice, first to a woman named Margaret, and then to a woman named Helen.\n\n##Marriages\n\nYoung's first marriage was to Margaret, a woman he met while training for the Catalina Channel swim. The couple had two children together, but they eventually divorced. Young's second marriage was to Helen, a woman he met through mutual friends. The couple had one child together and remained married until Young's death.\n\n#Late professional life\n\nAfter retiring from competitive swimming, Young went on to pursue a career in business. He worked as a sales representative for a sporting goods company, using his fame and reputation to promote the company's products. Young also worked as a swimming coach, helping to train and develop young swimmers.\n\n#Honors\n\nYoung was recognized for his contributions to the sport of swimming, including his induction into the International Swimming Hall of Fame. He was also awarded the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame's Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\n#See also\n\n* List of long-distance swimmers\n* Catalina Channel swim\n* Lake Ontario swim\n\n#References\n\n*Note: References are not included in this article*\n\n#External links\n\n*Note: External links are not included in this article*", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"George_Young_(swimmer)\" following this outline:\n\n#Early swimming achievements\n##Catalina swim training\n#Catalina channel swim\n##Swam with tides\n##Competition from Norman Ross\n##Public acclaim, with limited financial gain\n#Inconsistent swimming career\n##1927, 21-Mile Lake Ontario swim\n##1928, 15-Mile Lake Ontario swim\n##Wins Sept 1928 Montreal to Repentigney Marathon\n##1929, 15-mile Lake Ontario swim\n##1930, 15-mile Lake Ontario swim\n##Wins 1931 Lake Ontario win\n##Late swim career\n#Swim retirement and marriage\n##Marriages\n#Late professional life\n#Honors\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The league was formed in 1949 and has a rich history of producing talented footballers and competitive matches. The CRFL is one of the strongest and most popular regional football leagues in New South Wales, with a loyal following and a reputation for exciting games.\n\n# History\n\nThe Central Riverina Football League was formed in 1949, with five foundation clubs: Ariah Park-Mirrool, Barellan, Grong Grong-Matong, Narrandera, and Yanco. The league was established to provide a competitive and structured competition for football clubs in the Riverina region. Over the years, the CRFL has undergone several changes, including the addition of new clubs and the departure of others.\n\nIn the early years, the CRFL was dominated by the Ariah Park-Mirrool and Narrandera clubs, which won several premierships between them. However, other clubs such as Grong Grong-Matong and Yanco also had successful periods, winning premierships and producing talented players.\n\nIn recent years, the CRFL has continued to grow and develop, with the introduction of new initiatives and programs aimed at improving the competition and promoting football in the region. The league has also established strong relationships with other regional football leagues and governing bodies, ensuring that the CRFL remains a strong and competitive competition.\n\n## Mergers and Changes\n\nOver the years, the CRFL has undergone several mergers and changes, resulting in the current structure of the league. In 1974, the Ariah Park and Mirrool clubs merged to form the Ariah Park-Mirrool Football Club. In 1981, the Grong Grong and Matong clubs merged to form the Grong Grong-Matong Football Club.\n\nIn 1991, the Yanco Football Club was forced to withdraw from the competition due to financial difficulties. However, the club has since been re-established and currently competes in the CRFL.\n\n## Notable Events\n\nThe CRFL has hosted several notable events over the years, including the 1985 NSW Country Football Championships, which were held in Narrandera. The championships featured teams from across New South Wales and were a major success for the league.\n\nIn 2011, the CRFL celebrated its 60th anniversary, with a series of events and matches held throughout the season. The anniversary was marked with a grand final replay between the Ariah Park-Mirrool and Narrandera clubs, with Ariah Park-Mirrool emerging victorious.\n\n# Football Clubs\n\nThe Central Riverina Football League currently consists of six clubs:\n\n* Ariah Park-Mirrool Football Club\n* Barellan Football Club\n* Grong Grong-Matong Football Club\n* Narrandera Football Club\n* Yanco Football Club\n* East Wagga-Kooringal Football Club (joined the league in 2012)\n\nEach club has its own unique history and culture, and all are committed to promoting football in the Riverina region.\n\n## Club Information\n\n| Club | Nickname | Colours | Home Ground |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Ariah Park-Mirrool | Magpies | Black and White | Ariah Park Oval |\n| Barellan | Two Blues | Navy Blue and White | Barellan Oval |\n| Grong Grong-Matong | Crows | Black and Red | Grong Grong Oval |\n| Narrandera | Eagles | Royal Blue and White | Narrandera Oval |\n| Yanco | Tigers | Gold and Black | Yanco Oval |\n| East Wagga-Kooringal | Hawks | Brown and Gold | Gumly Oval |\n\n# Football Grand Finals\n\nThe Central Riverina Football League grand final is the culmination of the home and away season, with the top two teams competing for the premiership.

The film is loosely based on the true story of a 175-pound American black bear that died after ingesting a large quantity of cocaine in 1985. The film stars Keri Russell, O'Shea Jackson Jr., and Alden Ehrenreich, among others.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe film takes place in 1985 and follows a group of characters whose lives become intertwined after a 175-pound American black bear ingests a large quantity of cocaine. The bear, which has been dropped onto a forest in Tennessee by a plane carrying a shipment of cocaine, begins to wreak havoc on the local community. A single mother, Sari (Keri Russell), her son, Dee (Christian Convery), and a detective, Bob (O'Shea Jackson Jr.), team up to track down the bear and prevent further destruction. Meanwhile, a group of smugglers, led by Syd (Alden Ehrenreich), try to recover the lost cocaine and eliminate anyone who gets in their way.\n\n# Cast\n\n* Keri Russell as Sari\n* O'Shea Jackson Jr. as Detective Bob\n* Alden Ehrenreich as Syd\n* Christian Convery as Dee\n* Brooklynn Prince as Katie\n* Isiah Whitlock Jr. as Eddie\n* Margo Martindale as Ranger Liz\n* Ray Liotta as Syd's father\n\n# Inspiration\n\nThe film is loosely based on the true story of a 175-pound American black bear that died after ingesting a large quantity of cocaine in 1985. The bear had been dropped onto a forest in Tennessee by a plane carrying a shipment of cocaine. The incident became notorious due to the unusual circumstances of the bear's death.\n\n## Creative liberties\n\nWhile the film is inspired by a true story, it takes significant creative liberties with the events. The film's writer, Jimmy Warden, has stated that he was more interested in exploring the characters and their relationships than in retelling the true story accurately. The film's director, Elizabeth Banks, has also stated that she wanted to use the true story as a starting point to explore themes of community, family, and redemption.\n\n## Response to the film\n\nThe film's use of creative liberties has been met with some criticism from those who were involved in the original incident. However, the film's cast and crew have stated that they were not trying to make a documentary or a historically accurate retelling of the events, but rather a work of fiction inspired by the true story.\n\n# Production\n\n## Development and casting\n\nThe film was in development for several years before it was finally greenlit. The script was written by Jimmy Warden, and Elizabeth Banks was attached to direct. The cast was assembled over several months, with Keri Russell and O'Shea Jackson Jr. being the first to sign on. Alden Ehrenreich and Christian Convery were cast later, with Brooklynn Prince and Isiah Whitlock Jr. rounding out the supporting cast.\n\n## Filming\n\nPrincipal photography took place in the summer of 2022, with filming locations in North Carolina and Tennessee. The film's cinematographer, John Guleserian, used a combination of digital and film cameras to achieve a distinctive aesthetic. The film's editor, Joel Negron, worked closely with Banks to create a fast-paced and energetic editing style.\n\n# Music\n\nThe film's score was composed by Mark Mothersbaugh, who is known for his work on films like \"The Royal Tenenbaums\" and \"Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs\".

The acquisition process began in April 2022 and concluded in October 2022.\n\n# Prelude\n\n## Background\n\nTwitter, founded in 2006, had grown to become one of the largest social media platforms in the world, with over 440 million monthly active users. The company had faced various challenges in recent years, including declining user growth, increased competition from other social media platforms, and criticism over its content moderation policies.\n\n## Early developments\n\nIn January 2022, Elon Musk began accumulating shares of Twitter, eventually becoming the company's largest shareholder. Musk had been an active user of the platform, using it to share updates about his companies and engage with his followers. His investment in Twitter sparked speculation about his intentions, with some analysts suggesting that he might attempt to acquire the company.\n\n# Buyout offer\n\n## Takeover bid\n\nOn April 14, 2022, Musk announced that he had submitted a bid to acquire Twitter for $43 billion. The offer, which valued Twitter at $54.20 per share, represented a 38% premium over the company's closing price on April 13. Musk stated that he wanted to acquire Twitter to promote free speech and reduce censorship on the platform.\n\n## Acquisition announcement\n\nOn April 25, 2022, Twitter's board of directors accepted Musk's bid, and the company announced that it had agreed to be acquired by Musk. The acquisition was subject to approval by Twitter's shareholders and regulatory authorities.\n\n# Attempted termination\n\n## Alleged hold\n\nIn May 2022, Musk stated that he had put the acquisition on hold due to concerns over the number of fake accounts on Twitter. Musk claimed that Twitter had underreported the number of fake accounts, which he believed was a significant issue for the platform.\n\n## Attempted withdrawal by Musk\n\nOn July 8, 2022, Musk announced that he was withdrawing from the acquisition agreement, citing Twitter's alleged failure to provide him with information about fake accounts. Twitter's board of directors responded by stating that it would take legal action to enforce the acquisition agreement.\n\n# Revival and closing\n\n## Revitalization of bid\n\nOn October 4, 2022, Musk revived his bid to acquire Twitter, offering to purchase the company at the original price of $54.20 per share. Twitter's board of directors accepted the offer, and the company announced that it had agreed to be acquired by Musk.\n\n## Completion of purchase\n\nOn October 27, 2022, Musk completed the acquisition of Twitter, purchasing the company for $44 billion. Musk took over as CEO of Twitter, replacing Parag Agrawal, who had led the company since 2021.\n\n## Post-acquisition\n\nAfter acquiring Twitter, Musk announced plans to reform the platform's content moderation policies and reduce censorship. He also stated that he would allow former President Donald Trump to return to the platform, despite Trump's previous ban. Musk's acquisition of Twitter sparked widespread debate about the future of the platform and the implications of his ownership.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## Takeover bid\n\nMusk's takeover bid was met with a mixed reaction from Twitter users and analysts. Some praised Musk's commitment to free speech and his willingness to challenge Twitter's content moderation policies. Others expressed concerns about Musk's ability to manage the platform and his potential to spread misinformation.\n\n## Acquisition announcement\n\nThe acquisition announcement was met with a positive reaction from investors, with Twitter's stock price rising by 5% on the day of the announcement. However, some analysts expressed concerns about the potential risks of Musk's ownership, including the potential for decreased advertising revenue and increased competition from other social media platforms.\n\n## Attempted termination\n\nMusk's attempt to terminate the acquisition agreement was met with a negative reaction from Twitter's board of directors and investors. Twitter's stock price fell by 11% on the day of the announcement, and the company's board of directors vowed to take legal action to enforce the acquisition agreement.\n\n## Completion of purchase\n\nThe completion of the purchase was met with a mixed reaction from Twitter users and analysts. Some praised Musk's commitment to reforming the platform's content moderation policies, while others expressed concerns about the potential risks of his ownership.\n\n# Critical analysis\n\n## Takeover bid and acquisition announcement\n\nMusk's takeover bid and acquisition announcement were widely seen as a significant development in the history of Twitter. The acquisition marked a major shift in the platform's ownership and raised questions about the future of the company. Some analysts praised Musk's commitment to free speech and his willingness to challenge Twitter's content moderation policies. Others expressed concerns about Musk's ability to manage the platform and his potential to spread misinformation.\n\n## Attempted termination\n\nMusk's attempt to terminate the acquisition agreement was widely seen as a tactical move to renegotiate the terms of the deal. However, the move was met with a negative reaction from Twitter's board of directors and investors, who vowed to take legal action to enforce the acquisition agreement.\n\n## Revitalization of bid\n\nMusk's revitalization of his bid to acquire Twitter was widely seen as a surprise move. The decision marked a major shift in Musk's strategy and raised questions about his motivations for acquiring the company. Some analysts praised Musk's commitment to reforming the platform's content moderation policies, while others expressed concerns about the potential risks of his ownership.\n\n## Completion of purchase\n\nThe completion of the purchase marked a major milestone in the history of Twitter.

It is the long-awaited sequel to the 2009 film Avatar, which became the highest-grossing film of all time upon its release. The Way of Water continues the story of Jake Sully, a paraplegic marine who becomes the leader of the Na'vi people on the planet Pandora.\n\nPlot\n-----\n\nThe film takes place 13 years after the events of the first film. Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) have formed a family, with two sons, Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton), and an adopted daughter, Tuktirey (Trinity Bliss). However, their peaceful life is disrupted by the return of human colonizers, led by Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang), who seeks revenge against Jake for his role in the Na'vi's victory in the first film.\n\nAs the conflict escalates, Jake and his family are forced to flee their home and seek refuge with the Metkayina, a tribe of Na'vi who live in harmony with the ocean. The Metkayina are led by Tonowari (Cliff Curtis) and his wife, Ronal (Kate Winslet), who become allies to Jake and his family.\n\nAs the story unfolds, Jake and his family must navigate the dangers of the ocean and confront their own personal demons in order to protect their home and their way of life. Along the way, they discover new wonders and secrets about the planet Pandora and the Na'vi people.\n\nCast\n-----\n\n* Sam Worthington as Jake Sully\n* Zoe Saldana as Neytiri\n* Sigourney Weaver as Kiri\n* Stephen Lang as Colonel Miles Quaritch\n* Cliff Curtis as Tonowari\n* Kate Winslet as Ronal\n* Jamie Flatters as Neteyam\n* Britain Dalton as Lo'ak\n* Trinity Bliss as Tuktirey\n* Jack Champion as Spider\n\nThemes and Analysis\n--------------------\n\nAvatar: The Way of Water explores several themes that are central to the Avatar franchise. One of the primary themes is the clash between technology and nature. The human colonizers, led by Colonel Quaritch, represent the destructive power of technology, while the Na'vi people, led by Jake and Neytiri, represent a deep connection to the natural world.\n\nThe film also explores the theme of identity and belonging. Jake, who was once a human, has become a part of the Na'vi people, but he still struggles with his own identity. His sons, Neteyam and Lo'ak, also struggle with their own identities, as they navigate their mixed heritage.\n\nThe film also explores the theme of community and family. The Na'vi people are a tight-knit community that is based on a deep sense of connection and respect for one another. Jake and his family are at the center of this community, and their relationships with one another are a key part of the story.\n\nProduction\n------------\n\n### Development\n\nJames Cameron had been planning to make a sequel to Avatar since the release of the first film in 2009.

The tank was used to shoot the scenes that take place underwater, and it was filled with a large amount of water and equipped with a system for creating waves and currents.\n\n### Visual Effects\n\nThe visual effects for The Way of Water were created by Weta Digital, a company that is based in Wellington, New Zealand. The company used a combination of techniques, including motion capture, keyframe animation, and simulation, to create the characters, environments, and effects in the film.\n\n### Runtime\n\nThe runtime of The Way of Water is 192 minutes, making it one of the longest films of the year.\n\nMusic\n------\n\nThe score for The Way of Water was composed by Simon Franglen, who worked with James Cameron to develop the music for the film. The score features a combination of orchestral and choral elements, and it was recorded with a large orchestra and choir.\n\nMarketing\n----------\n\nThe marketing campaign for The Way of Water was launched in the spring of 2022, with the release of a teaser trailer that featured footage from the film.

The acts provided the framework for the governance of the armed forces, outlining the powers and responsibilities of military commanders, as well as the rights and obligations of soldiers. This article provides an overview of the background, passage, and renewal of the Mutiny Acts, as well as their impact on the military and society.\n\n#Background\n\nPrior to the passage of the first Mutiny Act, the English military was governed by a combination of common law, military custom, and royal prerogative. However, the lack of a clear and comprehensive framework for military governance led to problems with discipline and morale within the armed forces. The English Civil War highlighted the need for a more formal and codified system of military law, and in response, Parliament began to consider legislation to regulate the armed forces.\n\n#Passage of the first Mutiny Act\n\nThe first Mutiny Act was passed in 1689, shortly after the Glorious Revolution. The act was designed to establish a clear framework for military governance and to provide a more effective means of maintaining discipline within the armed forces. The act gave military commanders the power to try and punish soldiers for a range of offenses, including mutiny, desertion, and disobedience. The act also established the office of the Judge Advocate General, who was responsible for advising military commanders on matters of military law.\n\n#Renewal of the Mutiny Acts\n\nThe Mutiny Acts were initially passed as temporary measures, but they were repeatedly renewed and updated over the course of the 18th and 19th centuries. The acts were typically renewed for a period of one year, although some acts were passed for longer or shorter periods. The renewal of the Mutiny Acts provided an opportunity for Parliament to review and update the laws governing the armed forces, and to make changes in response to changing circumstances.\n\n#The Quartering Acts\n\nThe Quartering Acts were a series of laws passed in the 18th century to regulate the quartering of soldiers in the American colonies. The acts were closely related to the Mutiny Acts, as they provided for the housing and support of soldiers in the colonies. The Quartering Acts were highly unpopular in the colonies, where they were seen as an example of British tyranny and an infringement on colonial rights.\n\n#List\n\nThe following is a list of Mutiny Acts passed by the Parliament of England, Great Britain, and the United Kingdom:\n\n##England\n\n* 1689: The first Mutiny Act\n* 1690: The Mutiny Act of 1690\n* 1691: The Mutiny Act of 1691\n* 1692: The Mutiny Act of 1692\n* 1693: The Mutiny Act of 1693\n\n##Great Britain\n\n* 1702: The Mutiny Act of 1702\n* 1703: The Mutiny Act of 1703\n* 1704: The Mutiny Act of 1704\n* 1705: The Mutiny Act of 1705\n* 1706: The Mutiny Act of 1706\n\n##United Kingdom\n\n###1800s\n\n* 1803: The Mutiny Act of 1803\n* 1804: The Mutiny Act of 1804\n* 1805: The Mutiny Act of 1805\n* 1806: The Mutiny Act of 1806\n* 1807: The Mutiny Act of 1807\n\n###1810s\n\n* 1810: The Mutiny Act of 1810\n* 1811: The Mutiny Act of 1811\n* 1812: The Mutiny Act of 1812\n* 1813: The Mutiny Act of 1813\n* 1814: The Mutiny Act of 1814\n\n###1820s\n\n* 1820: The Mutiny Act of 1820\n* 1821: The Mutiny Act of 1821\n* 1822: The Mutiny Act of 1822\n* 1823: The Mutiny Act of 1823\n* 1824: The Mutiny Act of 1824\n\n###1830s\n\n* 1830: The Mutiny Act of 1830\n* 1831: The Mutiny Act of 1831\n* 1832: The Mutiny Act of 1832\n* 1833: The Mutiny Act of 1833\n* 1834: The Mutiny Act of 1834\n\n###1840s\n\n* 1840: The Mutiny Act of 1840\n* 1841: The Mutiny Act of 1841\n* 1842: The Mutiny Act of 1842\n* 1843: The Mutiny Act of 1843\n* 1844: The Mutiny Act of 1844\n\n###1850s\n\n* 1850: The Mutiny Act of 1850\n* 1851: The Mutiny Act of 1851\n* 1852: The Mutiny Act of 1852\n* 1853: The Mutiny Act of 1853\n* 1854: The Mutiny Act of 1854\n\n###1860s\n\n* 1860: The Mutiny Act of 1860\n* 1861: The Mutiny Act of 1861\n* 1862: The Mutiny Act of 1862\n* 1863: The Mutiny Act of 1863\n* 1864: The Mutiny Act of 1864\n\n###1870s\n\n* 1870: The Mutiny Act of 1870\n* 1871: The Mutiny Act of 1871\n* 1872: The Mutiny Act of 1872\n* 1873: The Mutiny Act of 1873\n* 1874: The Mutiny Act of 1874\n\n#Marine Mutiny Acts\n\nThe Marine Mutiny Acts were a series of laws passed to regulate the Royal Marines.

The outbreak occurred over a period of two days, producing multiple long-lived tornadoes and causing significant damage and loss of life.\n\n#Meteorological synopsis\n\nThe outbreak was caused by a strong low-pressure system that developed over the Rocky Mountains on November 3. As the system moved eastward, it interacted with a strong cold front, leading to the development of a dry line over the southern Great Plains. The combination of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and the dry air from the west created a highly unstable atmosphere, conducive to thunderstorm development. As the system continued to move eastward, it encountered a strong upper-level jet stream, which provided the necessary lift for the development of long-lived tornadoes.\n\n#Confirmed tornadoes\n\nA total of 30 tornadoes were confirmed during the outbreak, with the majority occurring on November 4. The tornadoes were rated on the Enhanced Fujita scale, which rates tornadoes from EF0 (light damage) to EF5 (incredible damage).\n\n##November 4 event\n\nThe first tornado of the outbreak touched down at 2:45 PM CST in the town of Brookston, Texas. The tornado, rated EF2, caused significant damage to homes and businesses, injuring several people. Over the next few hours, multiple tornadoes touched down across Texas and Oklahoma, including a long-lived EF3 tornado that affected the towns of Caviness and Midcity.\n\n##November 5 event\n\nThe second day of the outbreak saw a decrease in tornado activity, but several significant tornadoes still occurred. The most notable was an EF2 tornado that touched down in the town of Simms, Texas, causing significant damage to homes and businesses.\n\n##Brookston–Caviness–Midcity–Arthur City, Texas/Sawyer, Oklahoma\n\nThe longest-lived tornado of the outbreak occurred on November 4, affecting the towns of Brookston, Caviness, Midcity, and Arthur City, Texas, as well as Sawyer, Oklahoma. The tornado, rated EF3, was on the ground for over 30 miles, causing significant damage to homes and businesses. Several people were injured, and one person was killed.\n\n##Bogota–Clarksville–Acworth, Texas/Idabel–Broken Bow–Eagletown, Oklahoma\n\nAnother significant tornado occurred on November 4, affecting the towns of Bogota, Clarksville, and Acworth, Texas, as well as Idabel, Broken Bow, and Eagletown, Oklahoma. The tornado, rated EF2, caused significant damage to homes and businesses, injuring several people.\n\n##Cason–Naples, Texas\n\nA significant tornado occurred on November 4, affecting the towns of Cason and Naples, Texas. The tornado, rated EF2, caused significant damage to homes and businesses, injuring several people.\n\n##Simms–New Boston, Texas\n\nThe final significant tornado of the outbreak occurred on November 5, affecting the towns of Simms and New Boston, Texas. The tornado, rated EF2, caused significant damage to homes and businesses, injuring several people.\n\n#Non-tornadic effects\n\nIn addition to the tornadoes, the outbreak also produced significant non-tornadic effects, including large hail and damaging winds. Several areas reported hail up to 2 inches in diameter, causing significant damage to vehicles and buildings. Wind gusts up to 70 mph were also reported, causing power outages and property damage.\n\n#Impact\n\nThe outbreak had a significant impact on the affected areas, causing widespread damage and disruption. Several people were killed, and many more were injured. The economic impact was also significant, with estimated damages in the millions of dollars.\n\n#See also\n\n* List of tornado outbreaks\n* List of tornadoes in the United States\n* Tornado Alley\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is a summary of the Tornado Outbreak of November 4–5, 2022.

He played a significant role in the state's early history, producing several influential publications, including the North Carolina Gazette and The North Carolina Magazine. Davis's career as a printer and politician spanned over three decades, during which he became embroiled in controversy and allegations of counterfeiting.\n\n#Early and family life\n\nJames Davis was born in 1721 in England. Little is known about his childhood, but it is believed that he received some formal education and training as a printer's apprentice. In 1749, Davis immigrated to the American colonies, settling in New Bern, North Carolina. He quickly established himself as a skilled printer and began to build a reputation in the community.\n\nIn 1751, Davis married Sarah Dobbs, a local woman from a prominent family. The couple had several children together, including a son, James Jr., who would later follow in his father's footsteps as a printer and politician.\n\n#Printing career\n\n##North Carolina Gazette\n\nIn 1751, Davis began publishing the North Carolina Gazette, one of the first newspapers in the colony. The Gazette quickly gained popularity, thanks in part to Davis's commitment to providing accurate and timely news. The paper covered a wide range of topics, including local politics, commerce, and social events.\n\nUnder Davis's editorship, the Gazette became a powerful voice in the colony, advocating for the rights of citizens and criticizing government corruption. The paper's influence extended beyond the local community, with copies being distributed throughout the colonies.\n\n##The North Carolina Magazine\n\nIn 1764, Davis launched The North Carolina Magazine, a monthly publication that featured essays, poetry, and other literary works. The Magazine was aimed at a more refined audience and provided a platform for local writers to showcase their talents.\n\nThe Magazine was well-received by the colonial elite, who saw it as a symbol of the colony's growing cultural sophistication. However, the publication was not without controversy, as some critics accused Davis of promoting liberal and radical ideas.\n\n##Counterfeiting allegations\n\nIn 1767, Davis became embroiled in a scandal when he was accused of counterfeiting. The allegations centered on his role in printing paper currency for the colony, which some claimed was being used to finance illicit activities.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Davis's alleged counterfeiting activities led to a series of public feuds with his detractors, including the prominent politician, Thomas Hart. The scandal ultimately damaged Davis's reputation and led to a decline in his business.\n\n#Political career\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding his counterfeiting allegations, Davis remained active in politics. In 1769, he was elected to the North Carolina Provincial Congress, where he played a key role in shaping the colony's response to British taxation policies.\n\nDavis was a vocal advocate for colonial rights and opposed the Stamp Act, which he saw as an attempt to strangle the colony's economy. His views on taxation and governance were influential in shaping the colony's early political landscape.\n\n#Final days and legacy\n\nJames Davis died on October 16, 1785, at the age of 64. His legacy as a printer, publisher, and politician is complex and multifaceted. While his alleged counterfeiting activities tarnished his reputation, his contributions to the colony's early history and cultural development are undeniable.\n\nToday, Davis is remembered as a pioneering figure in North Carolina's history, who played a significant role in shaping the state's early identity. His publications, including the North Carolina Gazette and The North Carolina Magazine, remain important historical resources, providing insight into the colony's early politics, commerce, and culture.\n\n#See also\n\n* North Carolina Gazette\n* The North Carolina Magazine\n* Colonial American Publishers\n* Counterfeiting in the American colonies\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is based on historical records and accounts of James Davis's life and career.

Meanwhile, Maverick's love interest, Penny Benjamin (Connelly), a schoolteacher and single mother, tries to keep him grounded.\n\nThe team faces numerous challenges as they prepare for the mission, including navigating the complexities of modern warfare and confronting their own mortality.

The incident involved actor Will Smith slapping comedian Chris Rock on stage after Rock made a joke about Smith's wife, Jada Pinkett Smith. The incident sparked widespread attention and debate, with many questioning the appropriateness of Smith's actions and the handling of the situation by the Academy.\n\n# Background\n\nThe 94th Academy Awards ceremony took place at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles, California. Chris Rock was hosting the ceremony for the first time since 2005, while Will Smith was a nominee for Best Actor for his role in \"King Richard.\" The ceremony was broadcast live on ABC and streamed on various platforms.\n\n# Incident\n\nDuring the ceremony, Chris Rock took the stage to present the award for Best Documentary Feature. Before announcing the winner, Rock made a joke about Jada Pinkett Smith's shaved head, saying, \"Jada, I love ya. G.I. Jane 2, can't wait to see it.\" The joke was met with some laughter from the audience, but Will Smith initially appeared to laugh along with the joke. However, he then walked on stage and slapped Rock in the face.\n\n## Photograph\n\nA photograph of the incident, taken by Chris Willman of Variety, showed Smith's hand making contact with Rock's face. The photograph was widely shared on social media and sparked outrage and debate.\n\n## Uncensored viewership\n\nThe incident was broadcast live on ABC, but the network's five-second delay allowed them to censor the audio of the slap. However, viewers in some countries, such as Australia and the United Kingdom, saw the incident uncensored.\n\n## Additional videos\n\nIn the days following the incident, additional videos emerged showing the aftermath of the slap. One video showed Smith yelling at Rock to \"keep my wife's name out of your f***ing mouth\" after the slap.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe incident sparked a heated debate about the appropriateness of Smith's actions and the handling of the situation by the Academy.\n\n## Initial response\n\nThe Academy issued a statement condemning Smith's actions, saying, \"The Academy does not condone violence of any form.\" However, the organization was criticized for not taking more immediate action, such as removing Smith from the ceremony or revoking his Oscar.\n\n## Public apologies\n\nOn March 29, 2022, Smith issued a public apology to Rock, saying, \"My behavior at last night's Academy Awards was unacceptable and inexcusable. Jokes at my expense are a part of the job, but a joke about Jada's medical condition was too much for me to bear and I reacted emotionally.\" Rock declined to press charges against Smith.\n\n## Formal Academy review\n\nThe Academy announced a formal review of the incident, saying, \"The Academy's Board of Governors will convene to discuss the matter and determine any further actions.\" The review resulted in Smith's resignation from the Academy and a 10-year ban from attending the Oscars.\n\n## Resignation and ban\n\nOn April 1, 2022, Smith announced his resignation from the Academy, saying, \"I have directly responded to the Academy's disciplinary hearing notice, and I will fully accept any further consequences for my conduct.\" The Academy accepted Smith's resignation and imposed a 10-year ban on his attendance at the Oscars.\n\n## Smith film delayed\n\nThe incident led to the delay of Smith's upcoming film, \"Emancipation,\" which was set to be released in 2023. The film's director, Antoine Fuqua, announced that the film would be delayed due to the controversy surrounding Smith.\n\n## Later responses\n\nIn the months following the incident, Smith and Rock both addressed the incident in various interviews and public appearances.

The case is being prosecuted by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis and is considered one of the most significant election-related prosecutions in U.S. history.\n\n# Background\n\n## Prior to and during election day\n\nThe 2020 presidential election in Georgia was held on November 3, 2020, with Joe Biden ultimately winning the state by a margin of 12,670 votes. In the days and weeks following the election, Trump and his allies made numerous false claims of widespread voter fraud and election irregularities in Georgia.\n\n## Efforts to pressure Georgia state officials\n\nTrump and his allies made repeated attempts to pressure Georgia state officials to change the outcome of the election. This included phone calls and meetings with Governor Brian Kemp, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, and other officials. Trump also publicly attacked Georgia officials on social media, accusing them of being corrupt and incompetent.\n\n## Creation of false electoral vote documents\n\nIn December 2020, Trump allies created false electoral vote documents purporting to show that Trump had won the election in Georgia. These documents were sent to the National Archives and to Georgia state officials, in an apparent attempt to deceive them into accepting the false results.\n\n## Coffee County election equipment breach\n\nIn January 2021, a group of Trump supporters gained unauthorized access to election equipment in Coffee County, Georgia. The group, led by a local Republican official, made copies of sensitive election data and took photographs of the equipment. This breach was widely condemned by election officials and security experts.\n\n## Harassment of Fulton County election workers\n\nFulton County election workers, including poll workers and election administrators, reported being subjected to harassment and intimidation by Trump supporters. This included receiving threatening phone calls, emails, and messages on social media.\n\n# Indictment\n\n## Charges\n\nOn August 14, 2023, a grand jury in Fulton County, Georgia indicted Trump and 18 others on a range of charges related to their alleged attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. The charges include:\n\n* Racketeering\n* Solicitation of violation of oath by public officer\n* False statements and writings\n* Tampering with witnesses\n* Impersonating a public officer\n* Conspiracy to commit election fraud\n\n## Defendants\n\nIn addition to Trump, the defendants include:\n\n* Former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani\n* Former Trump advisor Steve Bannon\n* Former Georgia Republican Party chairman David Shafer\n* Former Coffee County Republican Party chairman Cathy Latham\n* Several other Trump allies and supporters\n\n# Initial proceedings\n\n## Surrender and booking\n\nSeveral of the defendants, including Trump, surrendered to authorities and were booked into the Fulton County Jail. Trump was released on his own recognizance, while several other defendants were required to post bond.\n\n## Arraignments\n\nThe defendants were arraigned in Fulton County Superior Court, where they entered not guilty pleas to the charges.\n\n# Pretrial motions\n\n## Attempts to dismiss charges\n\nThe defendants filed several motions to dismiss the charges, arguing that the indictment was flawed and that the prosecution had failed to present sufficient evidence. These motions were denied by the court.\n\n## Attempts to remove to federal court\n\nThe defendants also filed motions to remove the case to federal court, arguing that the federal government had exclusive jurisdiction over the alleged crimes. These motions were denied by the court.\n\n## Speedy trial and severance requests\n\nThe defendants requested a speedy trial, citing their right to a speedy trial under the Sixth Amendment. They also requested severance of the trials, arguing that the charges were too complex and that the jury would be prejudiced by the presence of multiple defendants.\n\n## Dismissal of solicitation and false documents charges\n\nIn September 2023, the court dismissed two of the charges against the defendants, including the solicitation of violation of oath by public officer and the false statements and writings charges.\n\n# Proceedings on prosecutorial impropriety\n\n## Background\n\nIn August 2023, the defendants filed a motion accusing District Attorney Fani Willis of prosecutorial impropriety. The motion alleged that Willis had engaged in improper conduct, including leaking information to the media and using her office for personal gain.\n\n## Hearing\n\nThe court held a hearing on the motion, at which Willis testified under oath. The defendants presented evidence of alleged impropriety, including emails and text messages between Willis and her staff.\n\n## Ruling and aftermath\n\nThe court ruled that Willis had not engaged in prosecutorial impropriety, but had instead followed proper procedures and protocols. The defendants appealed the ruling, arguing that the court had erred in its decision.\n\n## Appeal to dismiss Fani Willis from the case\n\nIn October 2023, the defendants filed an appeal to dismiss Willis from the case, arguing that she had a conflict of interest and had engaged in improper conduct. The appeal is pending.\n\n# Guilty pleas\n\n## Proffer video leak\n\nIn September 2023, a video was leaked showing one of the defendants, former Trump lawyer Kenneth Chesebro, making proffer statements to prosecutors. The video showed Chesebro describing his role in the alleged scheme to overturn the election results.\n\n# Trials\n\n## Date and duration\n\nThe trials are scheduled to begin in 2024, although the exact dates have not been set. The trials are expected to last for several weeks or months.\n\n## Procedures and potential witnesses\n\nThe trials will follow standard procedures, with the prosecution presenting evidence and calling witnesses. Potential witnesses include election officials, Trump allies, and others who were involved in the alleged scheme.\n\n# Reactions\n\nThe indictment and prosecution have received widespread attention and reaction, with many praising the efforts of District Attorney Fani Willis and the grand jury. Others have criticized the prosecution, arguing that it is a partisan attack on Trump and his allies.\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a summary of the Georgia election racketeering prosecution, and is intended to provide a neutral and factual overview of the case.\n\n# References\n\nNone.\n\n# Further reading\n\nNone.\n\n# External links\n\n## Federal removal dockets\n\nNone.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Georgia_election_racketeering_prosecution\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Prior to and during election day\n##Efforts to pressure Georgia state officials\n##Creation of false electoral vote documents\n##Coffee County election equipment breach\n##Harassment of Fulton County election workers\n#Indictment\n##Charges\n##Defendants\n#Initial proceedings\n##Surrender and booking\n##Arraignments\n#Pretrial motions\n##Attempts to dismiss charges\n##Attempts to remove to federal court\n##Speedy trial and severance requests\n##Dismissal of solicitation and false documents charges\n#Proceedings on prosecutorial impropriety\n##Background\n##Hearing\n##Ruling and aftermath\n##Appeal to dismiss Fani Willis from the case\n#Guilty pleas\n##Proffer video leak\n#Trials\n##Date and duration\n##Procedures and potential witnesses\n#Reactions\n#Notes\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n##Federal removal dockets\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The season officially began on June 1, 2023, and ended on November 30, 2023. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the season, including forecasts, seasonal summary, systems, storm names, and effects.\n\n#Seasonal forecasts\n\n##Pre-season forecasts\n\nPrior to the start of the season, several organizations released their predictions for the number of named storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes that would occur in 2023. These forecasts were based on various climate factors, including the state of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO).\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) released its pre-season forecast in May 2023, predicting a near-normal season with 9-15 named storms, 4-8 hurricanes, and 2-4 major hurricanes. The Climate Prediction Center (CPC) also released a forecast in May, predicting a slightly above-average season with 11-17 named storms, 5-9 hurricanes, and 3-5 major hurricanes.\n\n##Mid-season forecasts\n\nIn August 2023, NOAA and the CPC released their mid-season forecasts, which updated their predictions based on the latest climate trends. NOAA predicted a slightly above-average season with 11-16 named storms, 5-9 hurricanes, and 3-5 major hurricanes. The CPC also updated its forecast, predicting a slightly above-average season with 12-18 named storms, 6-10 hurricanes, and 4-6 major hurricanes.\n\n#Seasonal summary\n\n##Background\n\nThe 2023 Atlantic hurricane season was characterized by a mix of favorable and unfavorable climate conditions. The ENSO was in a neutral phase, which can lead to an average number of tropical cyclones. However, the NAO was in a positive phase, which can lead to an above-average number of tropical cyclones. Additionally, the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) was in a positive phase, which can lead to an increase in tropical cyclone activity.\n\n##Early activity\n\nThe season began slowly, with the first named storm, Arlene, forming on June 12, 2023. However, the storm was short-lived and dissipated on June 14, 2023.

The next few weeks saw the formation of several more named storms, including Don, Gert, and Emily. However, most of these storms were short-lived and did not reach hurricane strength.\n\nIn August, the season saw the formation of Hurricane Franklin, which became the first major hurricane of the season on August 15, 2023. Franklin reached Category 3 strength before making landfall in North Carolina on August 17, 2023.

The earthquake caused widespread destruction and loss of life, with its impact felt across the region. This article provides an overview of the earthquake, its effects, and the subsequent response and recovery efforts.\n\n#Tectonic setting\n\nThe Al Haouz Province is located in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco, an area of significant tectonic activity. The region is situated near the boundary between the Eurasian and African tectonic plates, which have been in a state of convergence for millions of years. This convergence has resulted in the formation of the Atlas Mountains, as well as numerous faults and fractures that crisscross the region. The tectonic setting of the Al Haouz Province makes it prone to earthquakes, which can occur as a result of the movement of the tectonic plates.\n\n#Earthquake\n\nThe 2023 Al Haouz earthquake occurred on September 8, 2023, at 23:15 local time. The earthquake had a magnitude of 6.8 on the moment magnitude scale and a depth of approximately 18 kilometers. The epicenter of the earthquake was located in the Al Haouz Province, near the city of Tahannaout.\n\n##Mechanism\n\nThe earthquake was a result of a complex sequence of events that occurred along a fault system in the Atlas Mountains. The fault system, known as the Atlas Fault, is a major structure that runs for hundreds of kilometers through the region. The earthquake occurred as a result of the sudden movement of the tectonic plates along this fault system, which released a massive amount of energy in the form of seismic waves.\n\n##Ground effects\n\nThe earthquake caused significant ground effects, including shaking, liquefaction, and landslides. The shaking caused by the earthquake was intense, with witnesses reporting that it felt like the ground was moving beneath their feet. The liquefaction of the soil caused by the shaking resulted in the collapse of buildings and infrastructure, while landslides blocked roads and rivers.\n\n#Damage and casualties\n\nThe 2023 Al Haouz earthquake caused widespread destruction and loss of life. The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, including homes, schools, and hospitals, leaving many people without access to basic necessities like shelter, food, and healthcare. The earthquake also caused significant damage to infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and utilities.\n\nAccording to official reports, the earthquake resulted in the deaths of over 2,000 people, with many more injured. The majority of the casualties were caused by the collapse of buildings and the resulting injuries from falling debris. The earthquake also left many people without access to basic necessities, including food, water, and shelter.\n\n#Search and rescue\n\nIn the aftermath of the earthquake, search and rescue teams were deployed to affected areas to locate and assist trapped survivors. The search and rescue efforts were led by local authorities, with assistance from international teams. The teams used specialized equipment, including dogs and thermal imaging cameras, to locate survivors buried under the rubble.\n\nDespite the challenges posed by the earthquake, the search and rescue efforts were successful in locating and assisting many survivors. However, the efforts were also hampered by the remote location of some affected areas and the lack of access to basic necessities like food, water, and healthcare.\n\n#International response\n\nThe international community responded quickly to the 2023 Al Haouz earthquake, with many countries offering assistance to affected areas. The United Nations, the European Union, and other international organizations played a key role in coordinating the response efforts.\n\nThe international response included the deployment of search and rescue teams, medical personnel, and humanitarian aid. The aid included food, water, shelter, and medical supplies, which were distributed to affected areas.\n\n#Recovery and assistance\n\nThe recovery efforts following the 2023 Al Haouz earthquake were led by local authorities, with assistance from international organizations. The efforts focused on providing basic necessities like shelter, food, and healthcare to affected communities.\n\nThe recovery efforts also included the rebuilding of damaged infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and utilities. The efforts were hampered by the remote location of some affected areas and the lack of access to basic necessities like food, water, and healthcare.\n\n#Aid and crisis management\n\nThe 2023 Al Haouz earthquake highlighted the importance of effective aid and crisis management. The international community responded quickly to the earthquake, with many countries offering assistance to affected areas.\n\nHowever, the response efforts were also hampered by challenges like the remote location of some affected areas and the lack of access to basic necessities like food, water, and healthcare.

At its peak, it was one of the largest and most prosperous empires in Southeast Asia, with a rich culture, architecture, and trade networks that stretched across the region and beyond. This article provides an overview of the history, government, culture, and society of the Ayutthaya Kingdom.\n\n# History\n\n## Origins\n\n### Pre-Ayutthaya cities\n\nBefore the founding of Ayutthaya, the region was inhabited by various city-states and kingdoms, including the Khmer Empire, the Srivijaya Empire, and the Lavo Kingdom. These cities played an important role in the development of trade and culture in the region.\n\n### The traditional founding of Ayutthaya\n\nAccording to traditional accounts, Ayutthaya was founded in 1350 by King Ramathibodi I, who is said to have established the city on a site that was previously a Khmer settlement.

One night, while out on a walk, Bhaskar is bitten by a wolf, which sets off a chain of strange events. As the full moon approaches, Bhaskar begins to experience strange transformations, growing hair and claws, and developing a keen sense of smell.\n\nAs Bhaskar struggles to come to terms with his new condition, he meets a local veterinarian, Dr. Anika (Kriti Sanon), who helps him understand what is happening to him. Together, they embark on a journey to find a cure for Bhaskar's condition, while also navigating the challenges of living in a small town where everyone knows each other's secrets.

The conflict has its roots in the complex history of the two countries and has escalated into a full-scale war, with significant humanitarian and economic consequences.\n\n#Background\n\n##Independent Ukraine and the Orange Revolution\n\nAfter gaining independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine sought to establish its own identity and pursue a path of European integration. In 2004, the Orange Revolution brought pro-European President Viktor Yushchenko to power, marking a significant shift away from Russia's sphere of influence.\n\n##Euromaidan, Revolution of Dignity, and pro-Russian unrest\n\nIn 2013, Ukraine's then-President Viktor Yanukovych suspended plans for a European Union association agreement, sparking widespread protests in Kiev's Independence Square, known as Euromaidan. The protests, which became known as the Revolution of Dignity, demanded greater European integration and an end to corruption. However, in eastern Ukraine, where there was strong support for Yanukovych and closer ties with Russia, pro-Russian unrest and separatist movements began to emerge.\n\n##Russian military bases in Crimea\n\nIn 1991, Ukraine and Russia signed a treaty allowing Russia to maintain a military presence in Crimea, a peninsula on the Black Sea. The treaty was set to expire in 2017, but in 2010, Ukraine extended the lease until 2042. The Russian military presence in Crimea was seen as a symbol of Russia's continued influence over Ukraine.\n\n##Legality and declaration of war\n\nThe conflict between Russia and Ukraine is complex, with both sides accusing each other of aggression. Ukraine has declared that it is at war with Russia, while Russia maintains that it is not at war with Ukraine, but rather supporting separatist movements in eastern Ukraine.\n\n#History\n\n##Russian annexation of Crimea (2014)\n\nIn February 2014, following the ousting of President Yanukovych, Russian troops moved into Crimea, and a referendum was held in which the majority of the population voted to join Russia. The annexation was widely condemned by the international community, and Ukraine, the United States, and the European Union imposed sanctions on Russia.\n\n##War in the Donbas (2014–2015)\n\n###Pro-Russia unrest\n\nIn April 2014, pro-Russian separatists declared the establishment of the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic in eastern Ukraine. The separatists, who were supported by Russia, began to take control of government buildings and infrastructure.\n\n###Armed conflict\n\nIn May 2014, Ukrainian government forces launched a military operation to retake control of the region. The conflict escalated into a full-scale war, with both sides suffering heavy casualties.\n\n###August 2014 Russian invasion\n\nIn August 2014, Russian troops crossed into Ukraine, and the conflict escalated further. The Russian military intervention was widely condemned by the international community.\n\n###Mariupol offensive and first Minsk ceasefire\n\nIn September 2014, Ukrainian government forces launched an offensive to retake the strategic port city of Mariupol. The offensive was successful, but a ceasefire was agreed upon in Minsk, Belarus, which brought a temporary end to the fighting.\n\n###End of 2014 and Minsk II agreement\n\nIn December 2014, a second ceasefire was agreed upon in Minsk, which brought a temporary end to the fighting. However, the conflict continued, and in January 2015, fighting broke out in the town of Debaltseve.\n\n##Line of conflict stabilizes (2015–2022)\n\n###2018 Kerch Strait incident\n\nIn November 2018, Russian naval forces seized three Ukrainian ships in the Kerch Strait, which connects the Black Sea to the Sea of Azov. The incident was widely condemned by the international community.\n\n###2019–2020", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Russo-Ukrainian_War\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Independent Ukraine and the Orange Revolution\n##Euromaidan, Revolution of Dignity, and pro-Russian unrest\n##Russian military bases in Crimea\n##Legality and declaration of war\n#History\n##Russian annexation of Crimea (2014)\n##War in the Donbas (2014–2015)\n###Pro-Russia unrest\n###Armed conflict\n###August 2014 Russian invasion\n###Mariupol offensive and first Minsk ceasefire\n###End of 2014 and Minsk II agreement\n##Line of conflict stabilizes (2015–2022)\n###2018 Kerch Strait incident\n###2019–2020\n##Full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine (2022)\n###Prelude\n###Escalation\n###Full-scale invasion\n##Ukrainian counteroffensives and stalemate (2022–2023)\n##Russian campaigns and Ukrainian Kursk offensive (1 December 2023 – present)\n#Human rights violations\n#Related issues\n##Spillover\n##Gas disputes and Nord Stream sabotage\n##Hybrid warfare\n##Russian propaganda and disinformation campaigns\n##Role of the Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine\n##Russia–NATO relations\n#Reactions\n##Reactions to the Russian annexation of Crimea\n###Ukrainian response\n###NATO and United States military response\n###Financial markets\n##Reactions to the war in Donbas\n###Ukrainian public opinion\n###Russian public opinion\n##Reactions to the Russian invasion of Ukraine\n###Ukrainian public opinion\n###Russian public opinion\n###United States\n###Russian military suppliers\n###United Nations\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
