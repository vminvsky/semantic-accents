It has a long history of use as a medicinal plant and is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing properties, making it a useful companion plant in agriculture. The plant's unique characteristics, such as its ability to thrive in poor soil and its adaptation to winter and early spring growth, have allowed it to occupy a specific ecological niche.\n\n#Scientific Name\nThe scientific name Anagyris foetida is derived from the Greek words \"anagyris,\" meaning \"without odor,\" and \"foetida,\" meaning \"stinking.\" This name reflects the plant's distinctive, unpleasant odor.\n\n#Common names\nAnagyris foetida is commonly known as the stinking bean trefoil, due to its strong, unpleasant smell and its trefoil-shaped leaves. It is also sometimes referred to as the bean trefoil or the Mediterranean trefoil.\n\n#Distribution\nAnagyris foetida is native to the Mediterranean region, where it can be found growing in a variety of habitats, including scrublands, woodlands, and along roadsides. It is widely distributed throughout the region, and can be found in countries such as Spain, France, Italy, Greece, and Turkey.\n\n#Habitat\nAnagyris foetida is able to thrive in a variety of habitats, including poor soil and dry conditions. It is often found growing in scrublands and woodlands, where it can take advantage of the shade and moisture provided by larger plants. It is also able to grow in full sun, and can tolerate a range of soil types, making it a versatile and adaptable plant.\n\n#Adaptations to growth in Winter and early Spring\nAnagyris foetida has a number of adaptations that allow it to thrive during the winter and early spring months. One of the most notable of these adaptations is its ability to grow and produce flowers during this time, when many other plants are dormant.\n\n##Summer leaf-fall\nOne of the most distinctive features of Anagyris foetida is its summer leaf-fall. During the hot summer months, the plant's leaves will often turn yellow and fall off, allowing the plant to conserve water and energy. This is a common adaptation in plants that grow in dry, Mediterranean climates.\n\n##Pollination by birds\nAnagyris foetida is pollinated by birds, which are attracted to the plant's nectar-rich flowers. The plant's flowers are small and yellow, and are arranged in clusters along the stem. They are rich in nectar, making them an attractive source of food for birds and other pollinators.\n\n#Seed dispersal\nAnagyris foetida has a number of mechanisms for seed dispersal, including soil seed banks, olive mimicry, and the role of sheep and other animals.\n\n##Soil seed banks\nOne of the most important mechanisms for seed dispersal in Anagyris foetida is the soil seed bank. The plant's seeds are able to survive in the soil for many years, allowing them to germinate and grow when conditions are favorable.\n\n##Olive mimicry\nAnagyris foetida seeds are able to mimic the seeds of olive trees, which are an important food source for many animals. This allows the seeds to be dispersed by animals that are attracted to olive seeds.\n\n##Role of sheep\nSheep play an important role in the seed dispersal of Anagyris foetida. The plant's seeds are able to survive the digestive system of sheep, allowing them to be deposited in new locations along with a package of fertilizer.\n\n##Other possible mammalian and avian vectors\nIn addition to sheep, a number of other mammals and birds may play a role in the seed dispersal of Anagyris foetida. These may include animals such as deer, rabbits, and birds such as partridges and quail.\n\n##Unknown seed dispersal vector\nDespite the importance of seed dispersal in the life cycle of Anagyris foetida, there is still much that is not known about the mechanisms involved. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of different animals and other factors in the seed dispersal of this plant.\n\n##Tough, waterproof seed coats\nThe seeds of Anagyris foetida have tough, waterproof coats that allow them to survive in a variety of environments. This is an adaptation to the plant's Mediterranean climate, where seeds may be exposed to hot, dry conditions for long periods of time.\n\n#Value as a nitrogen-fixing pioneer and companion plant\nAnagyris foetida is a valuable plant for its nitrogen-fixing properties, making it a useful companion plant in agriculture. The plant's ability to thrive in poor soil and its adaptation to winter and early spring growth make it an ideal pioneer plant, able to improve soil fertility and provide a habitat for other plants.\n\n#Medicinal use\nAnagyris foetida has been used for centuries in traditional medicine, particularly in the treatment of a variety of skin conditions. The plant's leaves and flowers are used to make a tea that is said to have anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.\n\n#Toxicity\nDespite its medicinal uses, Anagyris foetida is a toxic plant that should be handled with care. The plant contains a number of toxic compounds, including the alkaloid anagyrine, which can cause a range of health problems if ingested.\n\n##Alkaloid anagyrine a cause of birth defects\nAnagyrine, a toxic compound found in Anagyris foetida, has been linked to birth defects in animals. This highlights the importance of handling the plant with care, particularly for pregnant women.\n\n##Danger to children\nAnagyris foetida is a particular danger to children, who may be attracted to the plant's small, yellow flowers. Children should be kept away from the plant, and any ingestion should be treated as a medical emergency.\n\n##Hazardous tainting of milk products\nAnagyris foetida can also contaminate milk products, posing a risk to human health. This is particularly a concern for dairy farmers, who should take steps to avoid the plant's toxicity.\n\n##Case of accidental poisoning in Algeria\nIn one reported case, a group of people in Algeria accidentally ingested Anagyris foetida, resulting in a range of health problems. This highlights the importance of proper identification and handling of the plant.\n\n#Cultural references: Anagyris and Anagyrous\nAnagyris foetida has a number of cultural references, including its mention in the ancient Greek play \"Lysistrata.\"\n\n##Lysistrata\nIn \"Lysistrata,\" the plant is used as a metaphor for the power of women. The play's protagonist, Lysistrata, uses the plant's toxic properties to illustrate the dangers of war and the importance of female empowerment.\n\n##Persistence of name\nDespite the plant's toxicity, its name has persisted in cultural references. This is a testament to the plant's enduring presence in human culture and its importance as a symbol of power and resilience.\n\n#Gallery\n\n##Anagyris foetida\nA photograph of Anagyris foetida in its natural habitat.\n\n##Avian pollinators\nA photograph of a bird pollinating Anagyris foetida flowers.\n\n##Avian nectar thief\nA photograph of a bird stealing nectar from Anagyris foetida flowers.\n\n##Insect pollinators\nA photograph of an insect pollinating Anagyris foetida flowers.\n\n#See also\n* List of plants with toxic properties\n* Nitrogen-fixing plants\n* Pioneer plants", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Anagyris_foetida\" following this outline:\n\n#Scientific Name\n#Common names\n#Distribution\n#Habitat\n#Adaptations to growth in Winter and early Spring\n##Summer leaf-fall\n##Pollination by birds\n#Seed dispersal\n##Soil seed banks\n##Olive mimicry\n##Role of sheep\n##Other possible mammalian and avian vectors\n##Unknown seed dispersal vector\n##Tough, waterproof seed coats\n#Value as a nitrogen-fixing pioneer and companion plant\n#Medicinal use\n#Toxicity\n##Alkaloid anagyrine a cause of birth defects\n##Danger to children\n##Hazardous tainting of milk products\n##Case of accidental poisoning in Algeria\n#Cultural references: Anagyris and Anagyrous\n##Lysistrata\n##Persistence of name\n#Gallery\n##Anagyris foetida\n##Avian pollinators\n##Avian nectar thief\n##Insect pollinators\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He is best known for his ambitious goals in revolutionizing transportation, energy, and space exploration. Through his innovative ventures, Musk has become one of the most successful and influential figures in the tech industry.\n\n# Early life and education\n\n## Childhood and family\n\nElon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa. His father, Errol Musk, was an engineer, and his mother, Maye Musk, was a model and dietitian. Musk's parents divorced when he was ten years old, and he was raised by his father in Pretoria. He has two younger siblings, Kimbal and Tosca.\n\nMusk developed an interest in computing and programming at an early age. He taught himself computer programming and, at the age of 12, created his first software program, a space-themed video game called Blastar.\n\n## Education\n\nMusk attended Pretoria University High School and was an introverted child who was often bullied by his peers. He found solace in reading and learning, devouring books on a wide range of subjects, including physics, mathematics, and philosophy.\n\nAfter completing high school, Musk moved to Canada to attend college, hoping to avoid the mandatory military service in South Africa. He enrolled at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, but transferred to the University of Pennsylvania two years later. Musk graduated with a degree in economics and physics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1997.\n\n# Business career\n\n## Zip2\n\nMusk's first venture was Zip2, a company he co-founded in 1995 with his brother Kimbal. Zip2 provided online content publishing software for news organizations, and Musk served as the company's CEO. In 1999, Compaq acquired Zip2 for $307 million, with Musk receiving $22 million for his 7% stake in the company.\n\n## X.com and PayPal\n\nIn 1999, Musk co-founded X.com, which later became PayPal, an online payment system that was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in 2002. Musk was the company's largest shareholder, and he made a significant amount of money from the sale.\n\n## SpaceX\n\nMusk founded SpaceX in 2002 with the ambitious goal of reducing space transportation costs and enabling the colonization of Mars. SpaceX has since become a leading player in the private space industry, with numerous successful launches and a contract with NASA to transport astronauts to the International Space Station.\n\n### Starlink\n\nIn 2019, SpaceX launched its Starlink satellite constellation, a network of low-Earth orbit satellites designed to provide global internet connectivity. The project aims to generate revenue for SpaceX and help fund its Mars ambitions.\n\n## Tesla\n\nIn 2004, Musk co-founded Tesla, Inc., which has become one of the leading electric vehicle manufacturers in the world. The company has disrupted the automotive industry and played a significant role in popularizing electric vehicles.\n\n### SEC and shareholder lawsuits regarding tweets\n\nIn 2018, Musk faced criticism for his tweets about Tesla's financial performance and his plans to take the company private. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged Musk with securities fraud, and he agreed to pay a $20 million fine and step down as Tesla's chairman.\n\n### SolarCity and Tesla Energy\n\nIn 2016, Tesla acquired SolarCity, a solar energy company co-founded by Musk. The acquisition expanded Tesla's clean energy offerings and helped the company become a leader in the solar energy market.\n\n## Neuralink\n\nIn 2016, Musk co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology company that aims to integrate the human brain with computers. The company is developing implantable brain–machine interfaces (BMIs) that could potentially treat a wide range of medical conditions.\n\n## The Boring Company\n\nIn 2016, Musk co-founded The Boring Company, a tunnel construction company that aims to reduce traffic congestion in cities by building underground tunnels for high-speed transportation.\n\n## Twitter / X\n\nIn 2022, Musk acquired Twitter, Inc. and rebranded it as X. Musk has stated that he plans to use the platform to promote free speech and reduce content moderation.\n\n## Leadership style\n\nMusk is known for his demanding leadership style, which emphasizes innovation, risk-taking, and rapid iteration. He has been praised for his ability to inspire and motivate his employees, but has also faced criticism for his management style, which some have described as autocratic and intense.\n\n# Other activities\n\n## Musk Foundation\n\nThe Musk Foundation, established in 2002, focuses on providing solar-power energy systems in disaster areas and supporting STEM education.\n\n## Hyperloop\n\nIn 2013, Musk proposed the Hyperloop, a high-speed transportation system that could travel at speeds of up to 700 mph (1,127 km/h). The project aims to reduce travel times between cities and has the potential to transform the transportation industry.\n\n## OpenAI and xAI\n\nIn 2015, Musk co-founded OpenAI, a non-profit research organization that aims to develop and promote friendly artificial intelligence. In 2019, Musk left the OpenAI board to avoid conflicts with his work at Neuralink.\n\n## Tham Luang cave rescue and defamation case\n\nIn 2018, Musk was involved in a highly publicized cave rescue in Thailand, where a group of boys became trapped. Musk's attempt to assist the rescue effort was met with criticism, and he faced a defamation lawsuit from one of the rescue divers.\n\n## 2018 cannabis incident\n\nIn 2018, Musk sparked controversy when he smoked cannabis during a live podcast interview. The incident raised concerns about Musk's behavior and judgment.\n\n## Music\n\nMusk has released several electronic music tracks, including \"Don't Doubt Ur Vibe\" and \"Test Track\".\n\n## Private jet\n\nMusk has faced criticism for his use of a private jet, which has been seen as contradictory to his environmental goals.\n\n## Company towns\n\nIn 2022, Musk announced plans to build a company town near SpaceX's Starbase facility in Texas. The town, called Starbase, will provide housing and amenities for SpaceX employees.\n\n# Wealth\n\nMusk's net worth has fluctuated over the years, but he is currently one of the richest people in the world, with an estimated net worth of over $200 billion.\n\n# Personal actions, views, and social media usage\n\n## Finance\n\nMusk has been a vocal critic of the current financial system and has advocated for a more decentralized and transparent approach to finance.\n\n## Technology\n\nMusk has expressed concerns about the risks of advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence and biotechnology.\n\n## Existential threats\n\nMusk has spoken about the need to address existential threats, such as climate change and nuclear war, and has advocated for a more proactive approach to mitigating these risks.\n\n## Politics\n\nMusk has been involved in several high-profile controversies related to politics, including his support for conservative politicians and his criticism of liberal policies.\n\n### Conservative PAC activities\n\nIn 2022, Musk was revealed to have donated to a conservative political action committee (PAC), sparking criticism from some of his fans.\n\n### International politics\n\nMusk has expressed support for several international leaders, including Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping, and has faced criticism for his views on geopolitics.\n\n## Accusations of antisemitism\n\nMusk has faced accusations of antisemitism due to his criticism of Jewish finance and his perceived support for anti-Semitic ideologies.\n\n## COVID-19\n\nMusk has been a vocal critic of COVID-19 lockdowns and has advocated for a more nuanced approach to managing the pandemic.\n\n# Personal life\n\n## Relationships and children\n\nMusk has been married three times and has seven children.

The valley is situated near the Line of Control (LoC) that separates India from Pakistan. Characterized by its breathtaking landscapes, unique cultural heritage, and historical significance, the Aryan Valley has become a popular tourist destination in recent years. This article provides an overview of the geography and economy, history, and cultural aspects of the Aryan Valley.\n\n# Geography and economy\n\nThe Aryan Valley is nestled in the remote and rugged terrain of Ladakh, surrounded by the Karakoram mountain range. The valley is approximately 100 kilometers long and 30 kilometers wide, covering an area of around 3,000 square kilometers. The landscape is dominated by towering mountains, glaciers, and rivers, making it a challenging yet picturesque region to explore.\n\nThe economy of the Aryan Valley is primarily based on agriculture, with the main crops being barley, wheat, and potatoes. The region is also known for its rich mineral deposits, including copper, gold, and precious stones. However, the harsh climate and limited accessibility have hindered the development of large-scale mining and industrial activities.\n\nTourism has emerged as a significant contributor to the local economy in recent years, with visitors drawn to the valley's natural beauty, cultural heritage, and adventure sports opportunities. The Indian government has taken steps to promote tourism in the region, including the development of infrastructure such as roads, hotels, and trekking trails.\n\n# History\n\nThe Aryan Valley has a rich and complex history, with various cultures and empires leaving their mark on the region.\n\n## Brokpas\n\nThe Brokpas are an indigenous community that has inhabited the Aryan Valley for centuries. They are believed to be the descendants of the ancient Dards, a group of people who migrated to the region from Central Asia. The Brokpas have a unique culture and language, which is distinct from the rest of Ladakh. They are known for their expertise in agriculture, animal husbandry, and craftsmanship.\n\nThe Brokpas have a strong tradition of storytelling, music, and dance, which is an integral part of their cultural heritage. They are also known for their skills in archery, which was an essential part of their traditional way of life.\n\n## Aryan association and neologism\n\nThe term \"Aryan\" was introduced to the region by European scholars and explorers in the 19th century. The concept of an \"Aryan\" identity was based on the idea of a common Indo-European heritage, which was believed to be shared by the people of the region. However, this concept has been widely criticized for its lack of scientific basis and its association with racist and nationalist ideologies.\n\nDespite these criticisms, the term \"Aryan\" has stuck, and the region has become known as the Aryan Valley. The Indian government has also adopted the term, using it to promote tourism and cultural exchange in the region.\n\n# See also\n\n* Ladakh\n* Kashmir\n* Karakoram\n* Dard people\n* Indo-Aryan languages\n\n# Notes\n\nThe Aryan Valley is a remote and sensitive region, with limited access to basic amenities and services.

The monastery is a significant cultural and historical landmark in Ukraine, known for its stunning architecture, beautiful frescoes, and rich history. The monastery has played a crucial role in the development of Ukrainian Orthodoxy and has been a major center of spiritual and cultural life in the country.\n\nHistory\n\n### Early years\n\nThe monastery was founded in the 12th century by Prince Iziaslav Yaroslavich, who was the Grand Prince of Kyiv. The monastery was built in honor of the Archangel Michael, who was considered the patron saint of Kyiv. The monastery's original name was the \"Monastery of the Archangel Michael,\" and it was located on a hill overlooking the Dnieper River.\n\n### 16th–17th centuries\n\nDuring the 16th and 17th centuries, the monastery underwent significant transformations. In 1496, the monastery was rebuilt in stone, and the first stone church was constructed. The church was designed in the Byzantine style, with a single dome and a bell tower. The monastery also became a major center of learning and culture, with a school and a scriptorium.\n\n### 18th century\n\nIn the 18th century, the monastery underwent significant changes under the rule of the Russian Empire. In 1722, the monastery was rebuilt in the Baroque style, with a new church and a bell tower. The monastery also became a major center of Ukrainian Orthodoxy, with many prominent Ukrainian clergy serving as its abbots.\n\n### 19th century\n\nDuring the 19th century, the monastery continued to play an important role in Ukrainian cultural and spiritual life. In 1858, the monastery was renovated, and a new cathedral was built in the Byzantine Revival style. The cathedral was designed by the prominent Ukrainian architect, Viktor Schröter.\n\n### 20th century\n\nIn the 20th century, the monastery suffered significantly during the Soviet era. In 1929, the monastery was closed, and many of its monks were arrested and imprisoned. In 1934, the monastery's cathedral was demolished, and the site was used as a parking lot.\n\n### Demolition and aftermath\n\nThe demolition of the monastery's cathedral was a significant blow to Ukrainian cultural and spiritual life. Many Ukrainians saw the demolition as an act of cultural vandalism and a deliberate attempt to erase Ukrainian identity. The site of the monastery was also used as a parking lot and a dumping ground for construction waste.\n\n### Restoration\n\nIn the late 1990s, efforts began to restore the monastery to its former glory. The restoration process was a complex and challenging task, requiring significant funding and expertise.\n\n#### Plans and preparatory work\n\nIn 1995, the Ukrainian government established a commission to oversee the restoration of the monastery. The commission worked closely with architects, historians, and engineers to develop a comprehensive restoration plan. The plan included the rebuilding of the monastery's cathedral, as well as the restoration of its other buildings and artworks.\n\n#### Rebuilding the monastery\n\nIn 1997, construction began on the new cathedral. The cathedral was designed by the prominent Ukrainian architect, Yevhenia Maryniak. The cathedral was built using traditional Ukrainian building techniques and materials, including stone and wood. The cathedral's design was inspired by the original Byzantine Revival style of the 19th-century cathedral.\n\n#### Metropolitan see\n\nIn 2001, the monastery was designated as the metropolitan see of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate). The monastery's abbot, Metropolitan Vladimir Sabodan, played a significant role in promoting Ukrainian Orthodoxy and cultural heritage.\n\nArchitecture\n\n### Dates, styles and architects\n\nThe monastery's architecture reflects its complex and varied history. The monastery's original buildings were constructed in the Byzantine style, while the 18th-century renovations were carried out in the Baroque style. The 19th-century cathedral was built in the Byzantine Revival style, while the rebuilt cathedral is a mix of traditional Ukrainian and Byzantine Revival styles.\n\n### Cathedral (11th–20th century structure)\n\nThe monastery's original cathedral was constructed in the 11th century and was rebuilt several times over the centuries. The 19th-century cathedral was designed by Viktor Schröter and was built in the Byzantine Revival style. The cathedral featured a large central dome and four smaller domes, as well as a bell tower.\n\n### Rebuilt cathedral\n\n#### Exterior\n\nThe rebuilt cathedral is a stunning example of traditional Ukrainian architecture. The cathedral's exterior is constructed from stone and features a large central dome and four smaller domes. The cathedral's design is inspired by the original Byzantine Revival style of the 19th-century cathedral.\n\n#### Interior\n\nThe cathedral's interior is decorated with beautiful frescoes and mosaics. The cathedral's walls are adorned with intricate carvings and ornate decorations. The cathedral's iconostasis is a stunning example of traditional Ukrainian craftsmanship.\n\n### Refectory\n\nThe monastery's refectory is a large dining hall that was used by the monks for meals. The refectory features a large wooden table and benches, as well as a beautiful wooden ceiling.\n\n### Other buildings\n\nThe monastery's other buildings include the monks' quarters, the abbot's residence, and the monastery's scriptorium.\n\n#### Rebuilt bell tower\n\nThe monastery's bell tower was rebuilt in the late 1990s. The bell tower features a large bell and a stunning wooden ceiling.\n\nCathedral artworks (pre-1935)\n\n### Interior elements\n\nThe cathedral's interior features many beautiful artworks, including frescoes, mosaics, and carvings.\n\n#### Frescoes\n\nThe cathedral's walls are adorned with beautiful frescoes, depicting scenes from the Bible and the lives of saints. The frescoes were painted by prominent Ukrainian artists, including Viktor Vasnetsov and Mikhail Nesterov.\n\n#### Mosaics\n\nThe cathedral's mosaics are stunning examples of traditional Ukrainian craftsmanship. The mosaics depict scenes from the Bible and the lives of saints.\n\n### Relics of St. Barbara\n\nThe cathedral contains the relics of St. Barbara, a 3rd-century martyr. The relics are housed in a beautiful silver reliquary.\n\n### Iconostasis\n\nThe cathedral's iconostasis is a stunning example of traditional Ukrainian craftsmanship. The iconostasis features intricate carvings and ornate decorations.\n\n### Other notable artworks\n\nThe cathedral contains many other notable artworks, including paintings, sculptures, and carvings.\n\nBooks and documents\n\nThe monastery's library contains a vast collection of books and documents, including rare manuscripts and printed books.\n\nSee also\n\n* Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate)\n* Kyiv Pechersk Lavra\n* Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kyiv\n* Ukrainian Baroque\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n\n### In English\n\n* \"St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery\".

This phenomenon occurs when a government is overthrown, a country is occupied, or a new state emerges, but the international community does not recognize its legitimacy. In such cases, the diplomatic mission may continue to operate, albeit without official recognition, to promote the interests of the non-recognized government or state.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\nThe concept of an embassy without a government has existed throughout history, with several notable examples.\n\n### Russia (1917–1925)\n\n#### Diplomatic missions after 1917\n\nFollowing the Russian Revolution in 1917, the Provisional Government was overthrown, and the Bolsheviks established the Soviet Union. However, many countries, including the United States, did not recognize the new government. As a result, the Russian Embassy in Washington, D.C., continued to operate, representing the interests of the Russian people, rather than the Soviet government. The embassy was led by Boris Bakhmeteff, who served as the last Russian Ambassador to the United States.\n\n#### Dissolution of the Soviet Union\n\nIn 1991, the Soviet Union was dissolved, and the Russian Federation emerged as an independent state. The Russian Embassy in Washington, D.C., which had continued to operate throughout the Soviet era, was recognized as the official diplomatic mission of the Russian Federation.\n\n### Spain (1939–1977)\n\n#### Diplomatic missions after 1939\n\nFollowing the Spanish Civil War, the Republican government was overthrown, and General Francisco Franco established a dictatorship. However, many countries, including the United States, did not recognize the new government. As a result, the Spanish Embassy in Washington, D.C., continued to operate, representing the interests of the Spanish people, rather than the Franco regime. The embassy was led by Fernando de los Ríos, who served as the last Republican Ambassador to the United States.\n\n### Poland (1939–1990)\n\n#### Diplomatic missions after 1939\n\nFollowing the German and Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939, the Polish government-in-exile was established in London. The Polish Embassy in Washington, D.C., continued to operate, representing the interests of the Polish people, rather than the communist government established by the Soviet Union. The embassy was led by Jan Ciechanowski, who served as the Polish Ambassador to the United States.\n\n### Afghanistan (2021–present)\n\n#### Diplomatic missions after 2021\n\nFollowing the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in 2021, the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan was overthrown, and the Taliban established an interim government. However, many countries, including the United States, did not recognize the new government.

The company was founded in 2019 by Sam Bankman-Fried and Gary Wang, and was headquartered in Nassau, Bahamas. FTX was one of the largest and fastest-growing cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, known for its innovative products, high liquidity, and celebrity endorsements. However, in November 2022, FTX faced a severe crisis, which ultimately led to its bankruptcy and collapse.\n\n#History\n\nFTX was founded in 2019 by Sam Bankman-Fried, a former Wall Street trader, and Gary Wang, a former Google engineer. The company initially focused on providing derivatives trading products to institutional investors, but later expanded to retail traders. FTX quickly gained popularity due to its user-friendly interface, high liquidity, and innovative products, such as perpetual swaps and options.\n\nIn 2021, FTX raised $900 million in funding from prominent investors, including Sequoia Capital, SoftBank, and Tiger Global, valuing the company at $18 billion. The company used this funding to expand its operations, hire new employees, and invest in new products and technologies.\n\nFTX also established a number of subsidiaries, including Alameda Research, a cryptocurrency hedge fund, and FTX Ventures, a venture capital arm. Alameda Research was founded by Sam Bankman-Fried in 2017, before the launch of FTX, and was initially used to trade cryptocurrencies on behalf of the company.\n\n#November 2022 crisis and bankruptcy\n\n##Background: FTX and Alameda, Binance, and CoinDesk report\n\nIn November 2022, a series of events led to a severe crisis at FTX, which ultimately resulted in the company's bankruptcy. The crisis began when a report by CoinDesk, a cryptocurrency news website, revealed that Alameda Research, FTX's sister company, had a significant portion of its balance sheet tied up in FTX's own token, FTT.\n\nThis raised concerns about the solvency of Alameda Research and the potential risks to FTX, which was heavily invested in the hedge fund. The report sparked a wave of speculation and concerns among investors, which ultimately led to a sharp decline in the price of FTT.\n\n##Crisis begins: Binance FTT sale, sell-off, and withdrawn rescue bid\n\nOn November 6, 2022, Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, announced that it would be selling its entire stake in FTT. This sparked a wave of selling, which pushed the price of FTT down by over 70%.\n\nAs the price of FTT continued to decline, FTX faced a severe liquidity crisis. The company's customers began to withdraw their funds, which put further pressure on the company's balance sheet.\n\nOn November 8, 2022, Binance announced that it would be acquiring FTX, in a deal that would have valued the company at $1. The deal was seen as a rescue bid, but it was ultimately withdrawn due to concerns about FTX's financial health.\n\n##Bankruptcy and unauthorized transactions\n\nOn November 11, 2022, FTX filed for bankruptcy in the United States, in a dramatic move that marked the end of the company. The company's CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, resigned, and a new CEO, John J. Ray III, was appointed to oversee the company's liquidation.\n\nHowever, in the days following the bankruptcy filing, it emerged that FTX had made a number of unauthorized transactions, including the transfer of $10 billion in customer funds to Alameda Research. This raised concerns about the potential misuse of customer funds and the lack of oversight at the company.\n\n##Widening impact and contagion fears\n\nThe collapse of FTX had a significant impact on the wider cryptocurrency market, with a number of other companies facing liquidity crises and customer withdrawals.\n\nThere were also concerns about the potential for contagion, as a number of other companies had invested in FTX or had exposure to the company's token, FTT.\n\n##Responses and effects\n\n###Effects on investors\n\nThe collapse of FTX had a significant impact on investors, with a number of individuals and institutions facing significant losses. The company's customers were left with uncertain access to their funds, and many were forced to write off their investments.\n\n###Effects on other cryptocurrency firms and cryptocurrency markets\n\nThe collapse of FTX also had a significant impact on other cryptocurrency firms and markets. A number of companies faced liquidity crises, and there were concerns about the potential for contagion.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies also declined sharply, as investors became increasingly risk-averse.\n\n###Responses and commentary\n\nThe collapse of FTX was widely condemned, with many criticizing the company's lack of oversight and risk management. There were also calls for greater regulation of the cryptocurrency industry, in order to prevent similar collapses in the future.\n\n#Legal process\n\nIn the aftermath of the collapse, FTX faced a number of legal challenges, including lawsuits from investors and regulatory actions.\n\nThe company's CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, also faced personal legal challenges, including allegations of fraud and mismanagement.\n\n#Sponsorships\n\nFTX had a number of high-profile sponsorships, including partnerships with the Miami Heat and the Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team.\n\nHowever, in the aftermath of the collapse, many of these sponsorships were terminated, as the company's reputation was severely damaged.\n\n#References\n\n#External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"FTX\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n#November 2022 crisis and bankruptcy\n##Background: FTX and Alameda, Binance, and CoinDesk report\n##Crisis begins: Binance FTT sale, sell-off, and withdrawn rescue bid\n##Bankruptcy and unauthorized transactions\n##Widening impact and contagion fears\n##Responses and effects\n###Effects on investors\n###Effects on other cryptocurrency firms and cryptocurrency markets\n###Responses and commentary\n#Legal process\n#Sponsorships\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Before his presidency, he was a Hollywood actor and union leader, and served as the 33rd Governor of California from 1967 to 1975. Reagan's presidency was marked by a conservative agenda and significant events in international relations, including the end of the Cold War.\n\n#Early life\n\nRonald Reagan was born on February 6, 1911, in Tampico, Illinois, to John Edward Reagan and Nelle Clyde Wilson. He was the younger of two sons, and his family moved frequently during his childhood, eventually settling in Dixon, Illinois. Reagan attended high school in Dixon, where he developed an interest in acting and sports. He graduated in 1928 and attended Eureka College, where he studied economics and sociology and played football. After graduating in 1932, Reagan worked as a sports announcer for several radio stations in Iowa.\n\n#Entertainment career\n\n##Radio and film\n\nReagan's early career in entertainment began in radio, where he worked as a sports announcer for several stations in Iowa. In 1937, he moved to Hollywood to pursue a career in film, where he signed a contract with Warner Bros. studios. Reagan appeared in over 50 films during his career, including the popular Knute Rockne, All American (1940) and Bedtime for Bonzo (1951).\n\n##Military service\n\nIn 1942, Reagan enlisted in the U.S. Army Reserve and was assigned to the Army Air Forces. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant and served in the First Motion Picture Unit, which produced training and propaganda films. Reagan was honorably discharged in 1945 with the rank of captain.\n\n##Screen Actors Guild presidency\n\nReagan became involved in the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) in the 1940s and served as its president from 1947 to 1952 and again from 1959 to 1960. During his tenure, he helped to negotiate better pay and working conditions for actors and fought against the spread of communism in the film industry.\n\n##Marriages and children\n\nReagan married actress Jane Wyman in 1940, and they had two children, Maureen and Michael. The couple divorced in 1948, and Reagan married actress Nancy Davis in 1952. They had two children, Patricia and Ronald Jr.\n\n##Television\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, Reagan transitioned to television, where he worked as a host and actor on several shows, including the popular General Electric Theater. He also served as the president of the Screen Actors Guild and worked to improve the working conditions of actors.\n\n#Early political activities\n\n##1966 California gubernatorial election\n\nReagan's entry into politics began in 1966, when he ran for Governor of California as a Republican. He won the election, defeating incumbent Governor Pat Brown, and served two terms from 1967 to 1975.\n\n#California governorship (1967–1975)\n\nDuring his governorship, Reagan implemented several conservative policies, including reducing state spending and taxes. He also signed several laws aimed at reducing crime, including the Mulford Act, which prohibited the open carry of firearms.\n\n#Seeking the presidency (1975–1981)\n\n##1976 Republican primaries\n\nReagan ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 1976, but lost to incumbent President Gerald Ford. He ran again in 1980, this time winning the nomination and going on to defeat Democratic incumbent Jimmy Carter in the general election.\n\n##1980 election\n\nReagan's presidential campaign focused on several key issues, including reducing government spending, cutting taxes, and increasing military spending. He also promised to reduce the influence of the federal government and promote individual freedom. Reagan won the election by a landslide, carrying 44 states and receiving 489 electoral votes.\n\n#Presidency (1981–1989)\n\n##First inauguration\n\nReagan's first inauguration took place on January 20, 1981, and was notable for its emphasis on conservative values and individual freedom. In his inaugural address, Reagan famously declared that \"government is not the solution to our problem, government is the problem.\"\n\n##\"Reaganomics\" and the economy\n\nReagan's economic policies, known as \"Reaganomics,\" focused on reducing government spending, cutting taxes, and promoting individual freedom. The policies were based on the idea that economic growth would be stimulated by reducing the burden of government on the economy.\n\n###Taxation\n\nReagan signed the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, which reduced tax rates across the board and eliminated several tax loopholes. He also signed the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which further reduced tax rates and simplified the tax code.\n\n###Inflation and unemployment\n\nReagan's policies were successful in reducing inflation, which fell from 14.8% in 1980 to 4.1% in 1988. Unemployment also fell, from 7.5% in 1980 to 5.3% in 1988.\n\n###Government spending\n\nReagan's policies aimed to reduce government spending, but the federal budget actually increased during his presidency. The increase was largely due to increased military spending and the costs of the Iran-Contra affair.\n\n###Deregulation\n\nReagan signed several laws aimed at reducing government regulation of the economy, including the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980 and the Garn-St. Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982.\n\n###Deficits\n\nDespite Reagan's promises to reduce government spending and balance the budget, the federal deficit actually increased during his presidency. The deficit rose from $73 billion in 1980 to $221 billion in 1988.\n\n##Assassination attempt\n\nOn March 30, 1981, Reagan was shot by John Hinckley Jr. outside the Washington Hilton Hotel in Washington, D.C. Reagan suffered serious injuries, but made a full recovery and returned to duty as president.\n\n##Supreme Court appointments\n\nReagan appointed several conservative justices to the Supreme Court, including Sandra Day O'Connor, William Rehnquist, Antonin Scalia, and Anthony Kennedy.\n\n##Public sector labor union fights\n\nReagan faced several challenges from public sector labor unions during his presidency, including a strike by air traffic controllers in 1981. Reagan responded by firing the striking controllers and hiring new ones.\n\n##Civil rights\n\nReagan's policies on civil rights were mixed. He signed the Civil Rights Act of 1988, which provided additional protections for individuals with disabilities, but vetoed the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987, which would have provided additional protections for women and minorities.\n\n##War on drugs\n\nReagan launched a \"War on Drugs\" in 1982, which aimed to reduce the use and sale of illicit drugs. The effort included increased funding for law enforcement and treatment programs.\n\n##Escalation of the Cold War\n\nReagan's presidency was marked by an escalation of the Cold War, including a significant increase in military spending and a series of confrontations with the Soviet Union.\n\n##Invasion of Grenada\n\nIn 1983, Reagan authorized the invasion of Grenada, a small island nation in the Caribbean, in response to a Marxist coup. The invasion was widely criticized, but Reagan argued that it was necessary to protect American citizens and prevent the spread of communism.\n\n##1984 election\n\nReagan ran for re-election in 1984, defeating Democratic challenger Walter Mondale in a landslide. Reagan carried 49 states and received 525 electoral votes.\n\n##Response to the AIDS epidemic\n\nReagan was criticized for his slow response to the AIDS epidemic, which emerged during his presidency. He did not publicly mention the disease until 1985, and his administration was slow to provide funding for research and treatment.\n\n##Addressing apartheid\n\nReagan's policies on apartheid in South Africa were widely criticized. He opposed economic sanctions against the apartheid regime and vetoed several bills aimed at reducing American investment in South Africa.\n\n##Libya bombing\n\nIn 1986, Reagan authorized the bombing of Libya in response to several terrorist attacks sponsored by the Libyan government. The bombing was widely criticized, but Reagan argued that it was necessary to deter future attacks.\n\n##Iran–Contra affair\n\nThe Iran-Contra affair was a major scandal during Reagan's presidency, in which several administration officials were found to have secretly sold arms to Iran and used the proceeds to fund anti-Sandinista rebels in Nicaragua. Reagan denied any knowledge of the scandal, but several high-ranking officials were convicted of crimes related to the affair.\n\n##The USS Stark incident\n\nIn 1987, the USS Stark, an American naval ship, was attacked by an Iraqi warplane, killing 37 American sailors. Reagan faced criticism for his handling of the incident, which some argued was inadequate.\n\n##Soviet decline and thaw in relations\n\nDuring Reagan's presidency, the Soviet Union began to decline, and relations between the two superpowers began to thaw. Reagan met with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev several times, and the two leaders signed several arms control agreements.\n\n#Post-presidency (1989–2004)\n\n##Support for Brady Bill\n\nAfter leaving office, Reagan supported the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, which was passed in 1993. The law established a national background check system for firearms.\n\n##Alzheimer's disease\n\nIn 1994, Reagan announced that he had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. He died on June 5, 2004, at the age of 93.\n\n##Death and funeral\n\nReagan's funeral was held on June 11, 2004, and was attended by several former presidents and world leaders. He was buried at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California.\n\n#Legacy\n\n##Historical reputation\n\nReagan's historical reputation is mixed. Some historians praise his efforts to reduce government spending and promote individual freedom, while others criticize his policies on civil rights, the environment, and foreign policy.\n\n##Political influence\n\nReagan's influence on the Republican Party and American politics is significant. He helped to shift the party to the right and inspired a generation of conservative politicians.\n\n#Notes\n\n#References\n\n##Citations\n\n##Works cited\n\n###Books\n\n###Chapters\n\n###Journal articles\n\n#External links\n\n##Official sites\n\n##Media\n\n##News coverage\n\n##Other", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Ronald_Reagan\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n#Entertainment career\n##Radio and film\n##Military service\n##Screen Actors Guild presidency\n##Marriages and children\n##Television\n#Early political activities\n##1966 California gubernatorial election\n#California governorship (1967–1975)\n#Seeking the presidency (1975–1981)\n##1976 Republican primaries\n##1980 election\n#Presidency (1981–1989)\n##First inauguration\n##\"Reaganomics\" and the economy\n###Taxation\n###Inflation and unemployment\n###Government spending\n###Deregulation\n###Deficits\n##Assassination attempt\n##Supreme Court appointments\n##Public sector labor union fights\n##Civil rights\n##War on drugs\n##Escalation of the Cold War\n##Invasion of Grenada\n##1984 election\n##Response to the AIDS epidemic\n##Addressing apartheid\n##Libya bombing\n##Iran–Contra affair\n##The USS Stark incident\n##Soviet decline and thaw in relations\n#Post-presidency (1989–2004)\n##Support for Brady Bill\n##Alzheimer's disease\n##Death and funeral\n#Legacy\n##Historical reputation\n##Political influence\n#Notes\n#References\n##Citations\n##Works cited\n###Books\n###Chapters\n###Journal articles\n#External links\n##Official sites\n##Media\n##News coverage\n##Other\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The siege began in late February 2022 and lasted for nearly three months, resulting in significant destruction and loss of life.\n\n#Background\n\nMariupol is a strategic port city located in the Donetsk Oblast of Ukraine, with a pre-war population of approximately 430,000 people. The city has significant economic importance due to its steel production and maritime trade. In 2014, during the War in Donbas, Russian-backed separatists briefly captured Mariupol, but Ukrainian forces retook the city. Since then, Mariupol has been a key location for Ukrainian forces in the region.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the 2022 Russian invasion, Ukraine and Russia engaged in a series of diplomatic efforts to resolve their differences. However, these efforts ultimately failed, and Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022. Mariupol was one of the first cities to be targeted by Russian forces.\n\n#Advances to Mariupol\n\n##Preliminary shelling and advance on the city\n\nRussian forces began shelling Mariupol on February 24, 2022, with artillery and rocket fire. The initial shelling targeted Ukrainian military positions and infrastructure, including the city's airport. As the shelling continued, Ukrainian forces responded with counter-battery fire, attempting to silence the Russian artillery.\n\nIn the following days, Russian forces advanced on Mariupol, capturing several surrounding villages and towns. The Ukrainian military, supported by local militias, defended the city's outskirts, but Russian forces continued to push forward.\n\n##Mariupol surrounded\n\nBy March 2, 2022, Russian forces had surrounded Mariupol, cutting off the city's land routes and trapping its inhabitants. The Ukrainian military continued to defend the city, but their supply lines were severely limited, and the city's food and water supplies began to dwindle.\n\n#Urban advances\n\n##Russian push into the city\n\nOn March 12, 2022, Russian forces launched a major push into Mariupol, aiming to capture the city's center. The Ukrainian military resisted fiercely, but Russian forces gradually gained ground, capturing key buildings and infrastructure.\n\nAs the fighting intensified, the city's residents were forced to take shelter in basements, tunnels, and other underground locations. The humanitarian situation in the city deteriorated rapidly, with reports of food and water shortages, as well as medical emergencies.\n\n##Final pockets of resistance\n\nBy late March 2022, Russian forces had captured most of Mariupol, but Ukrainian forces continued to hold out in several pockets of resistance. The most significant pocket was the Azovstal steel plant, a massive industrial complex that became a symbol of Ukrainian resistance.\n\n#Resistance in the Azovstal steel plant\n\n##Withdrawal to Azovstal\n\nAs Russian forces advanced on Mariupol, Ukrainian forces withdrew to the Azovstal steel plant, a strategic location that offered natural defenses and access to the sea. The plant's defenders, including members of the Azov Regiment, prepared for a prolonged siege.\n\n##Siege of Azovstal\n\nRussian forces besieged Azovstal, launching repeated attacks on the plant's defenses. The Ukrainian defenders, supported by limited supplies of food, water, and ammunition, held out against the attacks, but their situation became increasingly desperate.\n\n##Evacuation of civilians\n\nOn April 30, 2022, Russian forces allowed a limited evacuation of civilians from Azovstal, but the process was slow and hampered by continued fighting. Many civilians remained trapped in the plant, and reports emerged of medical emergencies and food shortages.\n\n##Ukrainian surrender\n\nOn May 20, 2022, Ukrainian forces in Azovstal surrendered to Russian forces, marking the end of organized resistance in Mariupol. The Russian military claimed victory, but the humanitarian situation in the city remained dire.\n\n#Aftermath\n\n##Demolition of buildings and Russification of the city\n\nFollowing the surrender of Ukrainian forces, Russian authorities began a campaign to demolish buildings and infrastructure damaged during the fighting. The city's residents were forced to adapt to a new reality, with many buildings and landmarks destroyed or damaged beyond repair.\n\nRussian authorities also launched a campaign to Russify the city, promoting the use of the Russian language and culture. The city's Ukrainian identity was gradually erased, and many residents were forced to flee or adapt to the new reality.\n\n##Last Ukrainian holdouts and prisoners of war\n\nDespite the official surrender, some Ukrainian fighters continued to hold out in Mariupol, launching isolated attacks on Russian forces. These fighters were gradually captured or killed, and many were taken prisoner.\n\n##City government's role\n\nThe city government, now controlled by Russian-backed authorities, played a key role in the reconstruction and Russification of Mariupol. The government promoted the use of Russian language and culture, and many Ukrainian officials were replaced by Russian loyalists.\n\n##Claimed cholera outbreak\n\nIn July 2022, Ukrainian authorities claimed that a cholera outbreak had occurred in Mariupol, citing reports of contaminated water supplies and poor sanitation. Russian authorities denied the claims, but the humanitarian situation in the city remained dire.\n\n##Ukrainian missile strikes\n\nIn August 2022, Ukrainian forces launched a series of missile strikes on Mariupol, targeting Russian military positions and infrastructure. The strikes highlighted the ongoing conflict in the region and the continued tensions between Ukraine and Russia.\n\n#Casualties\n\n##Military casualties\n\nEstimates of military casualties during the Siege of Mariupol vary widely, but it is clear that both sides suffered significant losses. Ukrainian forces reported over 1,000 killed, while Russian forces reported over 500 killed.\n\n##Civilian casualties\n\nCivilian casualties were also significant, with estimates ranging from 1,000 to 20,000 killed. Many civilians were trapped in the city during the fighting, and reports emerged of medical emergencies, food shortages, and other humanitarian crises.\n\n#Humanitarian situation\n\nThe humanitarian situation in Mariupol remained dire throughout the siege and its aftermath. The city's residents faced food and water shortages, medical emergencies, and other humanitarian crises. Many were forced to flee the city, and those who remained faced significant challenges in accessing basic necessities.\n\n#War crimes committed by Russian", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Siege_of_Mariupol\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Advances to Mariupol\n##Preliminary shelling and advance on the city\n##Mariupol surrounded\n#Urban advances\n##Russian push into the city\n##Final pockets of resistance\n#Resistance in the Azovstal steel plant\n##Withdrawal to Azovstal\n##Siege of Azovstal\n##Evacuation of civilians\n##Ukrainian surrender\n#Aftermath\n##Demolition of buildings and Russification of the city\n##Last Ukrainian holdouts and prisoners of war\n##City government's role\n##Claimed cholera outbreak\n##Ukrainian missile strikes\n#Casualties\n##Military casualties\n##Civilian casualties\n#Humanitarian situation\n#War crimes committed by Russian forces\n##Shooting of evacuation checkpoints\n##Maternity and children's hospital bombing\n##Regional theatre bombing\n##Mass shelling of residential areas\n##Alleged use of chemical weapons\n#Media coverage\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He is best known for being the first Englishman to circumnavigate the globe, a feat he accomplished between 1577 and 1580. Drake's voyages and exploits had a profound impact on the English monarchy, the development of the English navy, and the country's relations with Spain.\n\n# Birth and early years\n\nFrancis Drake was born in 1540 in Tavistock, Devon, England. He was the eldest of twelve children born to Edmund Drake, a tenant farmer and a Protestant, and his wife, Mary Mylwaye. Drake's early life is not well documented, but it is believed that he received a basic education and was raised in a devoutly Protestant household.\n\n# Early career at sea\n\nDrake's early career at sea began in the 1560s, when he worked on merchant ships that sailed to France and the Netherlands. In 1563, he joined the English naval forces and served on a ship that sailed to the West Indies. Drake's experiences during this period helped to shape his skills as a navigator and his understanding of the sea.\n\n## Slave trade\n\nIn 1567, Drake sailed to the West Indies as part of a fleet that was engaged in the slave trade. The expedition was led by Sir John Hawkins, a prominent English merchant and privateer. Drake's involvement in the slave trade was a significant aspect of his early career, and it helped to establish him as a skilled navigator and a successful privateer.\n\n## Expedition of 1572–1573\n\nIn 1572, Drake sailed on an expedition to the West Indies that was led by his cousin, Sir John Hawkins. The expedition was designed to attack Spanish shipping and colonies in the Caribbean, and it was a significant success. Drake played a key role in the expedition, and his skills as a navigator and a fighter were instrumental in its success.\n\n## Rathlin Island massacre\n\nIn 1575, Drake was involved in the Rathlin Island massacre, a brutal attack on an Irish island that was inhabited by a clan of Scottish mercenaries. The attack was led by the Earl of Essex, and it was designed to punish the mercenaries for their support of the Irish rebels. Drake played a significant role in the attack, and his actions were widely criticized by his contemporaries.\n\n# Circumnavigation (1577–1580)\n\nDrake's most famous exploit was his circumnavigation of the globe, which he undertook between 1577 and 1580. The voyage was sponsored by Queen Elizabeth I, who was eager to establish England as a major naval power. Drake's ship, the Golden Hind, was one of the first English vessels to sail around the world, and the voyage was a significant success.\n\n## Execution of Thomas Doughty\n\nIn 1578, Drake had one of his crew members, Thomas Doughty, executed for mutiny. The execution was a significant event in the voyage, and it helped to establish Drake's authority as the commander of the ship.\n\n## Entering the Pacific (1578)\n\nIn 1578, Drake sailed into the Pacific Ocean, becoming the first Englishman to do so. The voyage was a significant achievement, and it helped to establish Drake as a major figure in the history of exploration.\n\n## Raids on Spanish American west coast\n\nDrake's voyage to the Pacific was also marked by a series of raids on Spanish American colonies along the west coast of South America. The raids were designed to disrupt Spanish shipping and trade, and they were a significant success.\n\n## Coast of California: Nova Albion (1579)\n\nIn 1579, Drake sailed along the coast of California, which he claimed for England and named Nova Albion. The voyage was a significant achievement, and it helped to establish Drake as a major figure in the history of exploration.\n\n## Across the Pacific and around Africa\n\nAfter completing his raids on the Spanish American colonies, Drake sailed across the Pacific and around Africa, becoming the first Englishman to circumnavigate the globe. The voyage was a significant achievement, and it helped to establish Drake as a major figure in the history of exploration.\n\n## Return to Plymouth (1580)\n\nIn 1580, Drake returned to Plymouth, England, where he was greeted as a hero. The voyage was a significant success, and it helped to establish Drake as a major figure in the history of exploration.\n\n## Knighthood and arms\n\nIn 1581, Drake was knighted by Queen Elizabeth I, who was eager to reward him for his services to the crown. Drake's coat of arms featured a ship and a motto, \"Sic Parvis Magna,\" which translates to \"Great things from small beginnings.\"\n\n# Political career\n\nDrake's political career was marked by his service to Queen Elizabeth I, who appointed him to a number of key positions. In 1581, Drake was appointed as the mayor of Plymouth, and he later served as a member of Parliament.\n\n# Great Expedition to America\n\nIn 1585, Drake was involved in the Great Expedition to America, a major naval expedition that was designed to attack Spanish colonies in the Caribbean. The expedition was a significant success, and it helped to establish Drake as a major figure in the history of exploration.\n\n# Conflict with the Spanish Armada\n\nDrake's most famous conflict was with the Spanish Armada, a major naval force that was sent by King Philip II of Spain to invade England.

The incident has sparked controversy and led to investigations by the Department of Justice and Congress.\n\n#Background\n\nAs Vice President under Barack Obama, Joe Biden had access to classified information and materials. It is common for government officials to retain documents and materials from their time in office for historical and research purposes. However, classified documents are subject to strict handling and storage protocols to protect national security.\n\n#Discoveries and other developments\n\n##First batch of documents\n\nIn November 2022, Biden's lawyers discovered a batch of classified documents at his office in Washington, D.C. The documents were reportedly from his time as Vice President and were stored in a secure location. The lawyers immediately notified the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), which is responsible for storing and maintaining presidential records.\n\n##DOJ letter to Bob Bauer\n\nOn November 9, 2022, the Department of Justice (DOJ) sent a letter to Bob Bauer, Biden's lawyer, requesting that the documents be handed over to the FBI. The letter stated that the DOJ was investigating the matter and that the documents were potential evidence.\n\n##Second batch of documents\n\nOn December 20, 2022, Biden's lawyers discovered a second batch of classified documents at his home in Wilmington, Delaware. The documents were reportedly stored in a garage and were from the same time period as the first batch.\n\n##FBI search of Biden's Wilmington home\n\nOn January 20, 2023, the FBI conducted a search of Biden's Wilmington home, reportedly to search for additional classified documents. The search was carried out with the cooperation of Biden's lawyers.\n\n##Other searches\n\nIn addition to the search of Biden's Wilmington home, the FBI also searched his office in Washington, D.C., and the Penn Biden Center, a think tank affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania, where Biden had an office.\n\n#Initial responses\n\n##Biden and his legal team\n\nBiden's lawyers have maintained that the documents were inadvertently taken from the White House at the end of the Obama administration and that they were cooperating fully with the investigation. Biden himself has stated that he was unaware of the documents and that he takes full responsibility for the mistake.\n\n##Elected officials\n\n###Republican elected officials\n\nRepublican elected officials have been quick to criticize Biden over the incident, with some calling for his impeachment. Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) has stated that the incident is \"a clear violation of the law\" and that Biden should be held accountable.\n\n###Democratic elected officials\n\nDemocratic elected officials have largely defended Biden, with some stating that the incident is a \"non-story\" and that Biden is cooperating fully with the investigation. Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) has stated that the incident is \"a minor mistake\" and that Biden has done nothing wrong.\n\n##Media analysis\n\nMedia analysis has varied widely, with some outlets criticizing Biden for the incident and others defending him. Some have pointed out that the incident is similar to one involving former President Donald Trump, who was accused of mishandling classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate.\n\n##Misinformation\n\nThere has been significant misinformation spread about the incident, with some claiming that Biden intentionally took the documents or that he is being investigated for a crime. These claims have been largely debunked by fact-checkers and law enforcement officials.\n\n##Discovery of classified documents at Mike Pence's residence\n\nIn January 2023, it was reported that classified documents had been discovered at the residence of former Vice President Mike Pence. The documents were reportedly from Pence's time as Vice President and were stored in a secure location. The incident has sparked comparisons to the Biden incident and has raised questions about the handling of classified documents by government officials.\n\n#Investigations\n\n##Special counsel\n\nIn January 2023, Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed a special counsel to investigate the Biden incident. The special counsel is charged with determining whether any laws were broken and whether charges should be brought.\n\n###Decision that charges were unwarranted\n\nIn June 2023, the special counsel announced that charges were unwarranted in the case, citing a lack of evidence of intent to mishandle classified documents.\n\n###Comments on Biden's memory\n\nThe special counsel also commented on Biden's memory, stating that the President had been cooperative and forthcoming during the investigation. The special counsel noted that Biden had a good memory for events, but that his memory for specific details was not perfect.\n\n##Congressional\n\nIn addition to the special counsel investigation, Congress has also launched an investigation into the incident. The investigation is being led by the House Oversight Committee and is focused on determining whether any laws were broken and whether the Biden administration has taken adequate steps to address the incident.\n\n#See also\n\n* Classified information in the United States\n* Presidential Records Act\n* National Archives and Records Administration\n* Federal Bureau of Investigation", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Joe_Biden_classified_documents_incident\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Discoveries and other developments\n##First batch of documents\n##DOJ letter to Bob Bauer\n##Second batch of documents\n##FBI search of Biden's Wilmington home\n##Other searches\n#Initial responses\n##Biden and his legal team\n##Elected officials\n###Republican elected officials\n###Democratic elected officials\n##Media analysis\n##Misinformation\n##Discovery of classified documents at Mike Pence's residence\n#Investigations\n##Special counsel\n###Decision that charges were unwarranted\n###Comments on Biden's memory\n##Congressional\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The battle took place from 22 to 25 April 1951, in the vicinity of Kapyong, South Korea, and was a key event in the Chinese Spring Offensive.\n\n# Background\n\n## Military situation\n\nIn the spring of 1951, the Korean War had reached a stalemate. The UNC, led by General Matthew Ridgway, had pushed the North Korean and Chinese forces back across the 38th parallel, but the communists had regrouped and were preparing to launch a massive counterattack. The UNC was aware of the impending attack, but the exact timing and location were unknown.\n\nThe 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (1 RAR) and the 2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry (2 PPCLI) were part of the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade, which was tasked with holding the Kapyong Valley. The valley was a strategic location, as it controlled access to the city of Seoul and the UNC's main supply lines.\n\n# Chinese Spring Offensive\n\n## Preparations\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the battle, the PVA had been massing troops and supplies in the vicinity of Kapyong. The UNC had detected the buildup, but the exact extent of the Chinese preparations was not clear. The PVA had constructed a network of tunnels and bunkers, which provided cover for their troops and allowed them to move undetected.\n\n## Launch of Chinese Spring Offensive\n\nOn the night of 22 April 1951, the PVA launched a massive attack on the UNC positions in the Kapyong Valley. The attack was preceded by a heavy artillery bombardment, which caught the UNC troops off guard. The PVA troops poured into the valley, overwhelming the UNC positions and pushing the defenders back.\n\n## South Korean withdrawal, 22–23 April 1951\n\nAs the PVA attack gained momentum, the South Korean troops in the area began to withdraw. The South Koreans had been tasked with holding the high ground to the north of the valley, but they were quickly overwhelmed by the PVA. The withdrawal of the South Koreans exposed the flank of the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade, which was now vulnerable to attack.\n\n# Australian 3 RAR defence of Hill 504, 23–24 April 1951\n\n## Night battle\n\nAs the PVA continued to push into the valley, the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3 RAR) was tasked with holding Hill 504, a strategic location that controlled access to the valley. The Australians had been warned of the impending attack, and they had prepared defensive positions on the hill. On the night of 23 April, the PVA launched a fierce attack on Hill 504, but the Australians held firm.\n\n## Day battle\n\nThe battle for Hill 504 raged on throughout the day of 24 April. The PVA continued to attack, but the Australians held their ground. The Australians were supported by artillery and air support, which helped to repel the PVA attacks.\n\n## 3 RAR withdraws\n\nAs the day wore on, the Australians began to withdraw from Hill 504. The PVA had suffered heavy casualties, but they continued to push forward. The Australians had held the hill for over 24 hours, but they were now in danger of being cut off. The withdrawal was carried out in an orderly fashion, with the Australians fighting a rearguard action to hold off the PVA.\n\n# Canadian 2 PPCLI last stand on Hill 677, 24–25 April 1951\n\n## Preparations\n\nAs the Australians withdrew from Hill 504, the 2 PPCLI was tasked with holding Hill 677, a strategic location that controlled access to the Kapyong Valley. The Canadians had been warned of the impending attack, and they had prepared defensive positions on the hill.\n\n## Night battle\n\nOn the night of 24 April, the PVA launched a fierce attack on Hill 677. The Canadians held firm, despite being heavily outnumbered. The battle was intense, with both sides suffering heavy casualties.\n\n## Final 2 PPCLI Operations\n\nThe Canadians continued to hold Hill 677 throughout the day of 25 April. The PVA continued to attack, but the Canadians held their ground. As the day wore on, the PVA began to withdraw, and the Canadians were able to regroup and reorganize.\n\n# Aftermath\n\n## Summary and casualties\n\nThe Battle of Kapyong was a decisive victory for the UNC. The PVA had suffered heavy casualties, with estimates ranging from 10,000 to 20,000 killed or wounded. The UNC had also suffered casualties, with over 1,000 killed or wounded.\n\n## Awards\n\nThe Battle of Kapyong was marked by numerous acts of bravery and heroism. The Australians and Canadians were awarded numerous decorations, including the Victoria Cross, the Military Cross, and the Military Medal.\n\n## Subsequent operations\n\nThe Battle of Kapyong marked a turning point in the Korean War. The PVA had been defeated, and the UNC had gained the initiative. The UNC continued to push the PVA back, eventually reaching the Chinese border. The war ended in 1953, with the signing of the Armistice Agreement.\n\n# See also\n\n* Korean War\n* United Nations Command\n* Chinese People's Volunteer Army\n* 27th British Commonwealth Brigade\n* 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment\n* 2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry\n\n# Notes\n\n## Footnotes\n\nThis article is based on a variety of sources, including official histories, memoirs, and secondary sources.\n\n## Citations\n\nThis article does not include citations.\n\n# References\n\nThis article does not include references.\n\n# Further reading\n\n* \"The Battle of Kapyong\".

They are known for their rich cultural heritage, seafaring traditions, and historical significance in the region. This article provides an overview of the origins, history, culture, and traditions of the Bugis people.\n\n#Origins and antecedents\n\n##Toalean — Pre-Austronesian South Sulawesi\n\nThe earliest known human habitation in South Sulawesi dates back to the Toalean period, around 8000 BCE. The Toaleans were a pre-Austronesian people who inhabited the region, characterized by their distinctive stone tools and hunting-gathering lifestyle. While the Toaleans are not directly related to the modern Bugis, they played a significant role in shaping the cultural and linguistic landscape of the region.\n\n##The arrival of Austronesians\n\nAround 2500 BCE, Austronesian-speaking peoples arrived in South Sulawesi, bringing with them new technologies, languages, and cultural practices. The Austronesians are believed to have originated from Taiwan and migrated southwards through the Philippines and Indonesia, eventually reaching Sulawesi. The arrival of the Austronesians marked the beginning of a new era in South Sulawesi, as they introduced agriculture, metalworking, and more complex social structures.\n\n##Tana Ogi — Land of the Bugis\n\nThe Bugis people emerged as a distinct ethnic group around the 14th century CE. The name \"Bugis\" is derived from the word \"Ugi,\" which refers to the Bugis kingdom of Luwu. The Bugis people consider themselves to be the original inhabitants of the region, which they call \"Tana Ogi\" or \"Land of the Bugis.\" Tana Ogi encompasses the southern part of Sulawesi, including the modern-day provinces of South Sulawesi and West Sulawesi.\n\n#History\n\n##Early society\n\nEarly Bugis society was characterized by a complex system of kinship, social hierarchy, and territorial divisions. The Bugis people were organized into smaller kingdoms, each with its own ruler and system of governance. The kingdoms were often at odds with one another, fighting over territory, resources, and influence.\n\n##The growth of Bugis kingdoms\n\nDuring the 15th to 17th centuries, the Bugis kingdoms experienced significant growth and expansion. The kingdom of Luwu, in particular, emerged as a major power in the region, controlling a vast territory and engaging in extensive trade networks. The Bugis kingdoms also developed sophisticated systems of agriculture, including irrigation and wet-rice cultivation.\n\n##Emergence of new political strengths over the peninsula\n\nIn the 17th century, new political powers emerged in the region, including the Makassar kingdom and the Dutch East India Company. The Makassar kingdom, in particular, posed a significant challenge to Bugis dominance, as it expanded its territory and influence through military conquests and strategic alliances.\n\n##Bugis-Makassar society in the 16th century\n\nDuring the 16th century, Bugis-Makassar society was characterized by a complex system of social hierarchy, with the nobility and aristocracy holding significant power and influence. The Bugis-Makassar people were also known for their seafaring traditions, engaging in extensive trade networks and maritime activities.\n\n##Early attempts to Christianize the Bugis states\n\nIn the 16th century, European missionaries, particularly the Portuguese and the Dutch, attempted to Christianize the Bugis states. However, these efforts were met with significant resistance, as the Bugis people were deeply committed to their traditional beliefs and practices.\n\n##Quest for prestige, influence and powers over the peninsula\n\nThroughout their history, the Bugis people have been driven by a quest for prestige, influence, and power over the peninsula. This has led to numerous conflicts and alliances, as the Bugis kingdoms have sought to expand their territory and influence.\n\n##The Islamisation of Bugis-Makassar-Mandar\n\nIn the 17th century, the Bugis-Makassar-Mandar people began to adopt Islam, which had a profound impact on their culture and society. Islamization led to the development of new social norms, values, and practices, as well as the creation of a more unified Bugis identity.\n\n##The twilight of dominance\n\nBy the 19th century, the Bugis kingdoms had begun to decline, as European colonial powers, particularly the Dutch, exerted greater control over the region. The Bugis people were forced to adapt to new systems of governance, economy, and culture, which eroded their traditional way of life.\n\n##A new golden age\n\nIn recent years, the Bugis people have experienced a cultural revival, as they seek to rediscover and promote their traditional heritage. This has led to a renewed interest in Bugis language, literature, and arts, as well as a greater appreciation for Bugis history and culture.\n\n#Culture\n\n##Language and dialects\n\nThe Bugis language is a member of the Austronesian language family and is spoken by approximately 4 million people. There are several dialects of the Bugis language, including Luwu, Wajo, and Soppeng.\n\n##Philosophy\n\nBugis philosophy is characterized by a deep respect for nature and the supernatural. The Bugis people believe in a complex system of spirits and ancestors, which are believed to influence daily life.\n\n##Traditional script\n\nThe Bugis people have a traditional script, known as the Lontara script, which is used to write the Bugis language. The Lontara script is an abugida script, consisting of 23 consonant symbols and 5 vowel symbols.\n\n##Folklore and literary traditions\n\nBugis folklore is rich in stories of heroes, myths, and legends. The Bugis people have a strong tradition of oral storytelling, which has been passed down through generations.\n\n##Dress, textiles and weaving traditions\n\nThe Bugis people are known for their traditional dress, which includes intricately woven textiles and ornate jewelry. The Bugis people have a long tradition of weaving and textile production, using natural fibers such as cotton and silk.\n\n##Culinary traditions\n\nBugis cuisine is known for its spicy flavors and use of fresh seafood. Traditional Bugis dishes include \"Coto Makassar\" (a spicy stew made with beef or chicken) and \"Sop Saudara\" (a spicy soup made with fish or meat).\n\n##Weaponry and military traditions\n\nThe Bugis people have a long tradition of warfare and military prowess. The Bugis people are skilled in the use of traditional weapons, such as the \"kris\" (a curved dagger) and the \"badik\" (a short sword).\n\n##Traditional architecture\n\nBugis traditional architecture is characterized by the use of wood and thatch. Traditional Bugis houses are designed to withstand the hot and humid climate of Sulawesi, with steeply pitched roofs and open ventilation.\n\n##Maritime, mercantile and migratory traditions\n\nThe Bugis people have a long tradition of seafaring and trade. The Bugis people have been known to sail and trade throughout the Indonesian archipelago, as well as with neighboring countries.\n\n##Rice and agrarian traditions\n\nThe Bugis people have a strong tradition of rice cultivation and agriculture. The Bugis people have developed sophisticated systems of irrigation and wet-rice cultivation, which have allowed them to thrive in the fertile soils of Sulawesi.\n\n##Festivals, celebrations and religious traditions\n\nThe Bugis people have a rich tradition of festivals and celebrations, which are often tied to Islamic holidays and traditional ceremonies. The Bugis people also have a strong tradition of spiritual practices, including the veneration of ancestors and spirits.\n\n##Musical traditions and performing arts\n\nBugis traditional music is characterized by the use of the \"gambus\" (a long-necked lute) and the \"rebana\" (a type of drum). The Bugis people also have a rich tradition of dance and theater, including the \"Sinrili\" (a traditional dance-drama).\n\n#See also\n\n* Austronesian peoples\n* Indonesian ethnic groups\n* Sulawesi\n* Bugis language\n* Lontara script\n* Islam in Indonesia\n\n#References", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Bugis\" following this outline:\n\n#Origins and antecedents\n##Toalean — Pre-Austronesian South Sulawesi\n##The arrival of Austronesians\n##Tana Ogi — Land of the Bugis\n#History\n##Early society\n##The growth of Bugis kingdoms\n##Emergence of new political strengths over the peninsula\n##Bugis-Makassar society in the 16th century\n##Early attempts to Christianize the Bugis states\n##Quest for prestige, influence and powers over the peninsula\n##The Islamisation of Bugis-Makassar-Mandar\n##The twilight of dominance\n##A new golden age\n#Culture\n##Language and dialects\n##Philosophy\n##Traditional script\n##Folklore and literary traditions\n##Dress, textiles and weaving traditions\n##Culinary traditions\n##Weaponry and military traditions\n##Traditional architecture\n##Maritime, mercantile and migratory traditions\n##Rice and agrarian traditions\n##Festivals, celebrations and religious traditions\n##Musical traditions and performing arts\n#See also\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He was a key figure in the Indian independence movement and played a significant role in the country's struggle for freedom. This article provides an overview of his life, personal experiences, and lasting impact on Indian society.\n\n# Biography\n-----------\n\nVijayasinhji Chhatrasinhji was born on October 12, 1893, in the princely state of Rajkot, Gujarat. He belonged to the Jadeja dynasty, a prominent Kshatriya clan that ruled over the region. From a young age, Vijayasinhji was drawn to politics and social service, inspired by the works of Indian nationalists like Mahatma Gandhi and Lokmanya Tilak.\n\nVijayasinhji's early education took place at the Rajkumar College in Rajkot, where he developed a strong foundation in politics, economics, and philosophy. He later attended the University of Bombay, where he earned a degree in law. After completing his studies, Vijayasinhji returned to Rajkot and began practicing law, using his skills to advocate for the rights of the marginalized and oppressed.\n\n## Entry into Politics\n\nVijayasinhji's entry into politics was marked by his involvement with the Indian National Congress, which was the primary vehicle for India's struggle for independence. He quickly rose through the ranks, becoming a key figure in the Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee. Vijayasinhji's leadership skills and commitment to the cause earned him the respect and admiration of his peers, including Mahatma Gandhi.\n\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, Vijayasinhji participated in several key movements, including the Non-Cooperation Movement and the Quit India Movement. He was arrested multiple times by the British authorities for his involvement in these movements, but he continued to fight for India's freedom.\n\n## Post-Independence Career\n\nAfter India gained independence in 1947, Vijayasinhji continued to play an active role in politics. He was elected to the Rajkot Municipal Council and later became the mayor of Rajkot. Vijayasinhji's post-independence career was marked by his commitment to social welfare and development. He worked tirelessly to improve the lives of the people of Rajkot, focusing on education, healthcare, and infrastructure development.\n\n# Personal Life\n--------------\n\nVijayasinhji was known for his simple and austere lifestyle.

Despite his royal heritage, Vijayasinhji lived a modest life, dedicating his time and resources to the service of others.\n\nVijayasinhji was married to Maharani Shri Rajnarsi Kunverba, with whom he had two sons and two daughters. His family was deeply involved in his social and political work, often accompanying him to public events and rallies.\n\n# Legacy\n----------\n\nVijayasinhji's legacy is a testament to his selfless service and dedication to the people of India. He played a significant role in the country's struggle for independence and continued to work for the betterment of society after independence.\n\nVijayasinhji's commitment to social welfare and development inspired a generation of leaders in Gujarat and beyond. He remains a beloved figure in Rajkot, where he is remembered for his kindness, compassion, and unwavering commitment to the cause of justice.\n\n## Commemoration\n\nVijayasinhji's legacy has been commemorated in several ways.

She is the leader of the Brothers of Italy (FdI) party and the first woman to hold the office of Prime Minister in Italian history. Meloni's rise to power has been marked by her advocacy for conservative and nationalist policies, as well as her criticism of the European Union and immigration.\n\n#Early life\n\nGiorgia Meloni was born on January 15, 1977, in Rome, Italy. Her family was part of the Italian middle class, and her parents were both civil servants. Meloni's interest in politics began at a young age, and she joined the youth wing of the Italian Social Movement (MSI) party, a neo-fascist organization, while still in high school.\n\n##Education and early political activism\n\nMeloni attended the Sapienza University of Rome, where she studied political science. During her university years, she became involved in the student movement and joined the MSI's youth wing. She quickly rose through the ranks, becoming a leader in the organization and developing a reputation as a skilled orator and organizer.\n\nAfter graduating from university, Meloni worked as a journalist and a communications consultant. She also continued to be involved in politics, serving as a local councilor in Rome and as a member of the MSI's national executive committee.\n\n#Political career\n\n##Minister of Youth\n\nIn 2008, Meloni was appointed Minister of Youth by Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. At the time, she was the youngest minister in the Italian government. During her tenure, she focused on promoting youth employment and education initiatives.\n\n##Leader of Brothers of Italy\n\nIn 2012, Meloni co-founded the Brothers of Italy (FdI) party, which emerged from a split within the MSI. She became the party's leader in 2014 and has since led the party to significant electoral success.\n\n##2022 Italian general election\n\nIn the 2022 Italian general election, Meloni's FdI party emerged as the largest party in the Chamber of Deputies, winning over 26% of the vote. Meloni's victory was seen as a major upset, as many had predicted that the center-left Democratic Party would win the election.\n\n#Prime Minister of Italy\n\n##Government formation\n\nAfter the 2022 election, Meloni formed a government with the center-right Forza Italia party and the League party. Her government was sworn in on October 22, 2022.\n\n##Domestic policies\n\nMeloni's government has focused on implementing a range of domestic policies, including tax cuts, deregulation, and increased spending on defense and law enforcement. She has also promised to reduce the size of the Italian bureaucracy and to increase transparency in government.\n\n##Constitutional reform\n\nMeloni has proposed a range of constitutional reforms, including changes to the Italian electoral system and the creation of a presidential system. Her proposals have been met with opposition from some quarters, who argue that they could lead to a reduction in democratic accountability.\n\n##Foreign policy\n\nMeloni's government has taken a tough stance on foreign policy, criticizing the European Union and pushing for greater Italian independence. She has also been critical of China and has promised to increase Italian defense spending.\n\n#Political positions\n\n##Social issues\n\nMeloni is a conservative on social issues, opposing same-sex marriage and abortion. She has also been critical of feminism, arguing that it has gone too far and that women's rights are not the only issue that matters.\n\n##Feminism\n\nMeloni has been critical of feminism, arguing that it has become too radical and that women's rights are not the only issue that matters. She has also argued that women should be free to choose their own path in life, whether that means staying at home to raise children or pursuing a career.\n\n##Immigration and multiculturalism\n\nMeloni has been critical of immigration and multiculturalism, arguing that they have led to a loss of Italian identity and culture. She has promised to reduce immigration and to increase border security.\n\n##Foreign issues\n\nMeloni has been critical of the European Union, arguing that it has become too bureaucratic and that it is eroding Italian sovereignty. She has also been critical of China, arguing that it is a threat to Italian and European security.\n\n##COVID-19 pandemic and vaccines\n\nMeloni has been critical of the Italian government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, arguing that it has been too slow and that it has imposed too many restrictions on individual freedom. She has also been critical of vaccine mandates, arguing that they are an infringement on individual rights.\n\n##Relationship with fascism\n\nMeloni has been accused of having ties to fascist organizations and of promoting fascist ideology. She has denied these allegations, arguing that she is a democratic politician who believes in the values of freedom and democracy.\n\n#Personal life\n\nMeloni is in a long-term relationship with Andrea Giambruno, a journalist and communications consultant. The couple has a daughter, Ginevra, who was born in 2016.\n\n#Honours and recognition\n\n##Foreign honours\n\nMeloni has received several foreign honors, including the Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland and the Grand Cross of the Order of the Oak Crown of Luxembourg.\n\n#Electoral history\n\n##First-past-the-post elections\n\n| Election | Constituency | Party | Votes | % | Result |\n| 2006 Italian general election | Lazio 1 | National Alliance | 50,236 | 23.1 | Won |\n| 2008 Italian general election | Lazio 1 | The People of Freedom | 63,256 | 33.1 | Won |\n| 2013 Italian general election | Lazio 1 | Brothers of Italy | 34,869 | 12.4 | Won |\n| 2018 Italian general election | Lazio 1 | Brothers of Italy | 69,732 | 34.1 | Won |\n| 2022 Italian general election | Lazio 1 | Brothers of Italy | 107,735 | 51.1 | Won |\n\n##Municipal elections\n\n| Election | City | Party | Votes | % | Result |\n| 2016 Rome municipal election | Rome | Brothers of Italy | 269,209 | 20.6 | Lost |\n\n#See also\n\n* List of Prime Ministers of Italy\n* Brothers of Italy\n* 2022 Italian general election\n\n#References\n\n#Bibliography\n\n* Meloni, Giorgia (2020).

It took place on August 5, 2023, at Ford Field in Detroit, Michigan.\n\nProduction\n==========\n\n### Background\n\nSummerSlam is an annual summer event produced by WWE since 1988. It is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and Survivor Series, which were dubbed the \"Big Four\". SummerSlam 2023 was the 36th event under the SummerSlam chronology and featured wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown brands.\n\n### Storylines\n\nThe event featured six matches on the card, with the majority of them being contested for championships. The main storyline going into the event was the feud between Roman Reigns and Jey Uso for the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship. The two had been at odds for several weeks, with Jey Uso emerging as a challenger for the title.\n\nAnother notable storyline was the rivalry between Seth Rollins and Finn Bálor for the World Heavyweight Championship. The two had a long history, with Rollins and Bálor engaging in a series of intense matches in the months leading up to SummerSlam.\n\nEvent\n=====\n\n### Preliminary matches\n\nThe event kicked off with a match between Liv Morgan and Rhea Ripley for the WWE Women's Championship. Morgan emerged victorious, retaining her title in a closely contested match.\n\nThe next match saw The Usos (Jimmy Uso and Jey Uso) defend their Undisputed WWE Tag Team Championship against The Judgment Day (Finn Bálor and Damian Priest). The Usos successfully retained their titles, thanks in part to interference from Roman Reigns.\n\nIn the third match, Seth Rollins faced off against Finn Bálor for the World Heavyweight Championship. Rollins emerged victorious, capturing the title in a hard-hitting match.\n\nThe fourth match saw Cody Rhodes take on Brock Lesnar in a highly anticipated bout. Lesnar emerged victorious, pinning Rhodes after an F-5.\n\n### Main event\n\nThe main event of the evening saw Roman Reigns defend his Undisputed WWE Universal Championship against Jey Uso. The two engaged in a intense and physical match, with Reigns ultimately emerging victorious. However, the match ended in controversy, as Jey Uso had Reigns beaten but was distracted by Paul Heyman, allowing Reigns to capitalize and retain his title.\n\nReception\n==========\n\nSummerSlam 2023 received generally positive reviews from critics and fans alike. The event was praised for its well-booked matches and strong performances from the wrestlers.\n\nMany praised the main event between Roman Reigns and Jey Uso, calling it one of the best matches of the year. The match was praised for its intense action and emotional storytelling.\n\nHowever, some critics felt that the event was marred by a lack of surprises and a predictable outcome. Many felt that the card was too predictable, with the winners of each match being fairly obvious.\n\nAftermath\n=========\n\n### Raw\n\nOn the following episode of Raw, Roman Reigns addressed the controversy surrounding his match against Jey Uso at SummerSlam. Reigns claimed that he had done what was necessary to retain his title, and that Jey Uso was simply a victim of circumstance.\n\nHowever, Jey Uso was not pleased with Reigns' explanation, and the two began to brawl. The brawl was eventually broken up by WWE officials, but it was clear that the feud between Reigns and Uso was far from over.\n\n### SmackDown\n\nOn the following episode of SmackDown, Seth Rollins celebrated his World Heavyweight Championship win over Finn Bálor at SummerSlam. However, Rollins' celebration was short-lived, as he was confronted by a returning Drew McIntyre.\n\nMcIntyre, who had been out of action for several months, claimed that he was the rightful champion and that Rollins had only won the title due to luck. The two began to brawl, setting up a potential future match between the two.\n\nResults\n=======\n\n* Liv Morgan defeated Rhea Ripley to retain the WWE Women's Championship\n* The Usos (Jimmy Uso and Jey Uso) defeated The Judgment Day (Finn Bálor and Damian Priest) to retain the Undisputed WWE Tag Team Championship\n* Seth Rollins defeated Finn Bálor to win the World Heavyweight Championship\n* Brock Lesnar defeated Cody Rhodes\n* Roman Reigns defeated Jey Uso to retain the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship\n\nReferences\n==========\n\nExternal links\n==============", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"SummerSlam_(2023)\" following this outline:\n\n#Production\n##Background\n##Storylines\n#Event\n##Preliminary matches\n##Main event\n#Reception\n#Aftermath\n##Raw\n##SmackDown\n#Results\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Shia Muslims have a long history in Lebanon, dating back to the early days of Islam, and have played a crucial role in shaping the country's politics, culture, and society.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### Origins\n\nThe origins of Shia Islam in Lebanon can be traced back to the 7th century, when the Arab conquest of the region introduced Islam to the local population. The Shia sect, which emerged as a result of a dispute over the succession of the Prophet Muhammad, gained a significant following in the region.\n\n### Early Islamic period\n\nDuring the early Islamic period, Shia Muslims in Lebanon were primarily concentrated in the Jabal Amel region, which is located in southern Lebanon. The region became a stronghold of Shia Islam and was home to many prominent Shia scholars and theologians.\n\n### Mamluk period\n\nDuring the Mamluk period, which lasted from the 13th to the 16th century, Shia Muslims in Lebanon faced significant persecution and marginalization. The Mamluk rulers, who were Sunni Muslims, viewed Shia Muslims as heretics and sought to suppress their influence in the region.\n\n### Under Ottoman rule\n\nThe Ottoman Empire, which ruled Lebanon from the 16th century until the early 20th century, had a complex relationship with Shia Muslims in the region. While the Ottomans were Sunni Muslims and often viewed Shia Muslims with suspicion, they also recognized the importance of Shia Muslims in Lebanon and sought to co-opt them into their administration.\n\n#### Relations with Safavid Iran\n\nDuring the 16th and 17th centuries, Shia Muslims in Lebanon maintained close ties with the Safavid dynasty in Iran, which was also Shia. This relationship helped to strengthen Shia Islam in Lebanon and provided a source of support and guidance for Shia Muslims in the region.\n\n### French mandate period\n\nDuring the French mandate period, which lasted from 1920 until 1946, Shia Muslims in Lebanon experienced significant changes in their social and economic status. The French, who were primarily interested in promoting the interests of the Maronite Christian community, often marginalized Shia Muslims and excluded them from positions of power.\n\n#### Education\n\nDuring the French mandate period, Shia Muslims in Lebanon had limited access to education, particularly at the higher levels. This was due in part to the lack of Shia-run schools and universities, as well as the dominance of Maronite and other Christian institutions.\n\n#### Ja'fari shar'ia courts\n\nIn 1926, the French authorities established Ja'fari shar'ia courts, which were responsible for governing the personal status of Shia Muslims in Lebanon. These courts were an important milestone in the development of Shia Islam in Lebanon and helped to establish the authority of Shia jurists in the region.\n\nSub-groups\n----------\n\n### Shia Twelvers (Metouali)\n\nThe Shia Twelvers, also known as the Metouali, are the largest Shia sub-group in Lebanon. They believe in the authority of the twelve imams, who are considered to be the rightful successors of the Prophet Muhammad.\n\n### Alawites\n\nThe Alawites are a smaller Shia sub-group in Lebanon, primarily concentrated in the north of the country. They have a unique set of beliefs and practices that are distinct from those of the Shia Twelvers.\n\n### Isma'ilis\n\nThe Isma'ilis are a small Shia sub-group in Lebanon, primarily concentrated in the city of Beirut. They believe in the authority of the Isma'ili imams, who are considered to be the rightful successors of the Prophet Muhammad.\n\nGeographic distribution within Lebanon\n--------------------------------------\n\nShia Muslims are distributed throughout Lebanon, although they are primarily concentrated in certain regions. The largest Shia population is found in the Jabal Amel region, which is located in southern Lebanon. Other significant Shia populations can be found in the Bekaa Valley and in the city of Beirut.\n\nDemographics\n------------\n\nShia Muslims make up approximately 30% of Lebanon's population, although the exact figure is difficult to determine due to the lack of reliable census data. Shia Muslims are primarily concentrated in rural areas, although there are also significant Shia populations in urban centers.\n\nGenetics\n--------\n\nStudies have shown that Shia Muslims in Lebanon have a unique genetic profile, which is distinct from that of other Lebanese populations. This is due in part to the historical isolation of Shia Muslims in the region, as well as their limited intermarriage with other groups.\n\nNotable Lebanese Shia Muslims\n-----------------------------\n\n### Religious figures\n\n* Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah, a prominent Shia cleric and theologian\n* Sayyid Muhammad Hussein Ali, a Shia cleric and politician\n* Ayatollah Sayyid Ali al-Amin, a Shia cleric and scholar\n\n### Political figures\n\n* Nabih Berri, a Shia politician and speaker of the Lebanese parliament\n* Ali Hassan Khalil, a Shia politician and minister of finance\n* Adnan Hassan, a Shia politician and minister of state\n\n### Academics\n\n* Ali Shariati, a Shia scholar and sociologist\n* Hisham Nashabe, a Shia scholar and historian\n* Said Hawat, a Shia scholar and philosopher\n\n### Artists, singers and journalists\n\n* Fairouz, a renowned Lebanese singer and actress\n* Sabah, a Lebanese singer and actress\n* Ghassan Kanafani, a Palestinian-Lebanese writer and journalist\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Shia Islam\n* Lebanon\n* Jabal Amel\n* Bekaa Valley\n* Beirut\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nExternal links\n--------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Lebanese_Shia_Muslims\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Origins\n##Early Islamic period\n##Mamluk period\n##Under Ottoman rule\n###Relations with Safavid Iran\n##French mandate period\n###Education\n###Ja'fari shar'ia courts\n#Sub-groups\n##Shia Twelvers (Metouali)\n##Alawites\n##Isma'ilis\n#Geographic distribution within Lebanon\n#Demographics\n#Genetics\n#Notable Lebanese Shia Muslims\n##Religious figures\n##Political figures\n##Academics\n##Artists, singers and journalists\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
