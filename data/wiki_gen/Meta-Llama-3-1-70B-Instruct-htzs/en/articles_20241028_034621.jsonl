He is best known for his victory at the Battle of Gettysburg, where he defeated the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia led by General Robert E. Lee. Meade's leadership and strategic thinking played a crucial role in the Union's ultimate victory in the war.\n\n**Early life and education**\n\nGeorge Meade was born on December 31, 1815, in Cádiz, Spain, where his parents were serving as diplomats. He was the eighth of eleven children born to Richard Worsam Meade and Margaret Coats Butler Meade. Meade's family was of English and Irish descent, and his ancestors had settled in the United States in the 17th century. In 1817, the Meade family returned to the United States and settled in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\nMeade attended the Mount Hope Institution in Baltimore, Maryland, and later graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1835. He ranked 19th out of 56 cadets in his class and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the United States Army Corps of Topographical Engineers.\n\n**Topographical Corps and Mexican-American War**\n\nMeade served in the Topographical Corps, which was responsible for surveying and mapping the United States. He worked on several projects, including the survey of the Great Lakes and the mapping of the Rio Grande River. In 1846, Meade was sent to Mexico, where he served as a topographical engineer during the Mexican-American War. He was present at the Battle of Palo Alto and the Battle of Resaca de la Palma, where he was wounded.\n\n**American Civil War**\n\nMeade's service in the American Civil War began in August 1861, when he was appointed as a brigadier general of volunteers. He commanded the 2nd Brigade of the Pennsylvania Reserves and later became the commander of the 1st Division of the I Corps of the Army of the Potomac.\n\n### **Peninsula campaign**\n\nMeade's first major campaign was the Peninsula campaign, where he served under General George McClellan. Meade's division played a key role in the Battle of Mechanicsville, where they repelled a Confederate attack. He was also present at the Battle of Gaines' Mill, where he was wounded.\n\n### **Maryland campaign**\n\nIn September 1862, Meade's division was transferred to the XII Corps, where he served under General Joseph K. Mansfield. Meade's division played a key role in the Battle of Antietam, where they helped to repel a Confederate attack.\n\n### **Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville**\n\nMeade's division was present at the Battle of Fredericksburg, where they suffered heavy casualties. He was also present at the Battle of Chancellorsville, where he was wounded.\n\n### **Gettysburg campaign**\n\n#### **Command of the Army of the Potomac**\n\nOn June 28, 1863, Meade was appointed as the commander of the Army of the Potomac, replacing General Joseph Hooker. Meade was given command of the army just three days before the Battle of Gettysburg.\n\n#### **Battle of Gettysburg**\n\nMeade's leadership and strategic thinking played a crucial role in the Union's victory at the Battle of Gettysburg. On July 1, 1863, Confederate forces under General Robert E. Lee launched a surprise attack on the Union army. Meade's forces were able to hold off the attack, and on July 2, they launched a counterattack that repelled the Confederates. On July 3, Meade's forces defeated the Confederates in a decisive battle, known as Pickett's Charge.\n\n#### **Lee's retreat**\n\nAfter the Battle of Gettysburg, Meade's forces pursued Lee's army as they retreated back to Virginia. Meade's forces were able to defeat the Confederates at the Battle of Falling Waters, but they were unable to capture Lee's army.\n\n### **Bristoe and Mine Run campaign**\n\nIn October 1863, Meade's army launched a campaign against Lee's army, known as the Bristoe and Mine Run campaign. The campaign was unsuccessful, and Meade's forces were forced to retreat back to Washington.\n\n### **Overland campaign**\n\nIn May 1864, Meade's army launched a campaign against Lee's army, known as the Overland campaign. The campaign was a series of battles and skirmishes that lasted for several months. Meade's forces were able to defeat the Confederates at the Battle of the Wilderness, but they were unable to capture Lee's army.\n\n### **Richmond-Petersburg campaign**\n\nIn June 1864, Meade's army launched a campaign against Lee's army, known as the Richmond-Petersburg campaign. The campaign was a series of battles and skirmishes that lasted for several months. Meade's forces were able to defeat the Confederates at the Battle of Petersburg, but they were unable to capture Lee's army.\n\n### **Political rivalries**\n\nMeade's leadership and strategic thinking were often overshadowed by his rivalries with other generals, including General Ulysses S. Grant and General William Tecumseh Sherman. Meade's relationship with Grant was particularly strained, and the two men often clashed over strategy and tactics.\n\n**Reconstruction**\n\nAfter the war, Meade served as the military governor of the Third Military District, which included the states of Georgia, Alabama, and Florida. He played a key role in the Reconstruction era, working to ensure that the rights of African Americans were protected.\n\n**Personal life**\n\nMeade was married to Margaretta Sergeant Meade, and the couple had seven children together. Meade was a member of the Episcopal Church and was known for his strong sense of morality and integrity.\n\n**Later life and death**\n\nMeade died on November 6, 1872, at the age of 56, due to complications from pneumonia. He was buried in Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nMeade's legacy as a general and a leader is still debated among historians today. Some historians view him as a capable and strategic thinker, while others see him as indecisive and lacking in initiative. Despite these criticisms, Meade's victory at the Battle of Gettysburg remains one of the most significant moments in American history.\n\n### **Memorials to Meade**\n\nMeade's legacy is remembered through several monuments and memorials, including the Meade Memorial in Washington, D.C. and the General Meade Statue in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\n**In popular culture**\n\nMeade has been portrayed in several films and television shows, including the film \"Gettysburg\" and the television series \"Death and the Civil War\".\n\n**Dates of rank**\n\n* Second Lieutenant, United States Army Corps of Topographical Engineers (1835)\n* First Lieutenant, United States Army Corps of Topographical Engineers (1836)\n* Captain, United States Army Corps of Topographical Engineers (1846)\n* Brigadier General, United States Volunteers (1861)\n* Major General, United States Volunteers (1863)\n* Brigadier General, United States Army (1865)\n* Major General, United States Army (1865)\n\n**See also**\n\n* American Civil War\n* Battle of Gettysburg\n* United States Army\n* Topographical Corps\n\n**References**\n\n(Note: References are not included in this article, as per the requirements)\n\n**External links**\n\n(Note: External links are not included in this article, as per the requirements)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"George_Meade\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and education\n#Topographical Corps and Mexican-American War\n#American Civil War\n##Peninsula campaign\n##Maryland campaign\n##Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville\n##Gettysburg campaign\n###Command of the Army of the Potomac\n###Battle of Gettysburg\n###Lee's retreat\n##Bristoe and Mine Run campaign\n##Overland campaign\n##Richmond-Petersburg campaign\n##Political rivalries\n#Reconstruction\n#Personal life\n#Later life and death\n#Legacy\n##Memorials to Meade\n#In popular culture\n#Dates of rank\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The film is a horror reimagining of A.A. Milne's classic children's stories, featuring Winnie-the-Pooh and Piglet as the main antagonists. The movie has garnered significant attention and controversy due to its dark and violent take on the beloved characters.\n\nPlot\n-----\n\nThe film takes place in a post-apocalyptic forest, where Winnie-the-Pooh and Piglet have grown up without Christopher Robin's care and attention. As a result, they have become savage and violent, terrorizing anyone who enters their forest. The story follows a group of college students who venture into the woods, only to be stalked and killed by the vengeful Pooh and Piglet.\n\nAs the plot unfolds, it becomes clear that the characters' descent into madness and violence is a result of their abandonment by Christopher Robin. The film explores themes of trauma, isolation, and the consequences of neglect. The movie's climax features a gruesome showdown between the surviving students and the killer duo, culminating in a shocking finale that redefines the classic characters.\n\nCast\n-----\n\n* Craig David Dowsett as Winnie-the-Pooh\n* Chris Cordell as Piglet\n* Amber Doig-Thorne as Alice\n* Maria Taylor as Tina\n* Danielle Ronald as Zoe\n* Natasha Tosini as Jess\n* Richard D. Myers as Christopher Robin (voice)\n\nProduction\n------------\n\n### Development\n\nThe film was conceived by Rhys Frake-Waterfield, a British writer and director, who wanted to create a horror film that subverted the expectations of a classic children's story. Frake-Waterfield was inspired by the public domain status of A.A. Milne's original stories, which allowed him to reimagine the characters in a darker context. The film's script was written in a matter of weeks, with Frake-Waterfield drawing from his own experiences with trauma and isolation.\n\n### Filming\n\nPrincipal photography took place in the United Kingdom, with a relatively low budget of $100,000. The film's crew consisted of a small team of British filmmakers, who worked closely with Frake-Waterfield to bring his vision to life. The film's cinematography was handled by Vince Knight, who utilized a mix of handheld camerawork and static shots to create a sense of unease and tension.\n\n### Music\n\nThe film's score was composed by Andrew Scott Bell, who incorporated a mix of eerie sound design and haunting melodies to create a sense of unease. The score features a prominent use of discordant notes and atonal sounds, which add to the film's sense of tension and foreboding. The soundtrack also features a haunting rendition of the classic Winnie-the-Pooh theme, which is reimagined in a dark and twisted way.\n\nRelease\n--------\n\n### Marketing\n\nThe film's marketing campaign was handled by ITN Distribution, who released a series of provocative trailers and posters that highlighted the film's dark and violent take on the classic characters. The trailers were met with a mixture of shock and fascination, with many viewers expressing their outrage and curiosity about the film.\n\n### Home media\n\nThe film was released on DVD and Blu-ray in the United Kingdom, with a limited edition release featuring a behind-the-scenes documentary and deleted scenes. The film has also been made available on various streaming platforms, including Amazon Prime and YouTube.\n\nReception\n----------\n\n### Box office\n\nThe film performed moderately well at the box office, grossing over $1 million in its opening weekend. The film's success was largely driven by its notoriety and controversy, with many viewers attending screenings out of curiosity.\n\n### Critical response\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising its originality and others condemning its graphic violence and dark themes. The film holds a 40% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 50 reviews, with an average rating of 4.5/10.\n\n### Accolades\n\nThe film was nominated for several awards, including the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture and the Fangoria Chainsaw Award for Best Wide-Release Film.\n\nFuture\n--------\n\n### Sequel\n\nA sequel to the film has been announced, with Rhys Frake-Waterfield set to return as writer and director. The sequel is expected to explore the further adventures of Winnie-the-Pooh and Piglet, and will reportedly feature an even darker and more violent tone.\n\n### Shared universe and other projects\n\nThere have been reports of a potential shared universe featuring Winnie-the-Pooh and other classic children's characters, although no official announcements have been made. Frake-Waterfield has expressed his interest in exploring other classic characters in a horror context, and has hinted at potential projects featuring the likes of Peter Pan and Alice in Wonderland.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* List of horror films\n* List of films based on children's books\n* Winnie-the-Pooh\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nExternal links\n---------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Winnie-the-Pooh:_Blood_and_Honey\" following this outline:\n\n#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production\n##Development\n##Filming\n##Music\n#Release\n##Marketing\n##Home media\n#Reception\n##Box office\n##Critical response\n##Accolades\n#Future\n##Sequel\n##Shared universe and other projects\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The move was made in response to the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, which began in February 2022. The mobilization aimed to increase the number of Russian troops participating in the conflict and to bolster the country's military presence in Ukraine.\n\n# Background\n\n## Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics\n\nIn 2014, following the Ukrainian Revolution, pro-Russian separatists in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine declared independence, forming the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) and the Luhansk People's Republic (LPR). The two self-proclaimed republics have been supported by Russia, which has provided them with military aid and personnel. In February 2022, Russia recognized the DPR and LPR as sovereign states, leading to a significant escalation of the conflict in Ukraine.\n\n## Russia\n\nRussia's involvement in the conflict in Ukraine has resulted in significant losses for the Russian military. According to various estimates, Russia has lost thousands of soldiers, as well as numerous pieces of military equipment, including tanks, aircraft, and helicopters.\n\n### Russian losses\n\nThe exact number of Russian losses in Ukraine is difficult to determine, as the Russian government has not released official figures. However, various sources, including Ukrainian officials and independent analysts, have estimated that Russia has lost between 5,000 to 10,000 soldiers since the start of the conflict in 2014.\n\n# Prelude\n\n## Volunteer recruitment campaign\n\nIn the months leading up to the mobilization, the Russian government launched a volunteer recruitment campaign, aimed at encouraging Russian citizens to join the military and participate in the conflict in Ukraine. The campaign was widely publicized in Russian media, with advertisements and recruitment centers set up across the country.\n\n## Legislative changes\n\nIn addition to the volunteer recruitment campaign, the Russian government made several legislative changes aimed at facilitating the mobilization. In July 2022, the Russian Duma passed a law allowing the government to mobilize Russian citizens in the event of a threat to national security. The law also established a new category of military service, known as \"mobilization reserve,\" which would allow the government to call up citizens with military experience in times of crisis.\n\n## Recruitment of prisoners\n\nIn August 2022, the Russian government announced plans to recruit prisoners to participate in the conflict in Ukraine. The move was widely criticized by human rights groups, who argued that it was a form of forced labor and a violation of international law.\n\n# Putin's speech\n\nOn September 21, 2022, President Putin delivered a televised speech, in which he announced the partial mobilization of the Russian Armed Forces. Putin stated that the mobilization was necessary to protect Russia's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and to ensure the country's national security.\n\n# Decree\n\nFollowing Putin's speech, the Russian government issued a decree, which outlined the terms of the mobilization. The decree established a number of key provisions, including the categories of citizens who would be subject to mobilization, and the procedures for calling up citizens.\n\n## Official publication and entry into force\n\nThe decree was officially published on September 21, 2022, and entered into force immediately. The decree was signed by President Putin, and was countersigned by the Russian Defense Minister, Sergei Shoigu.\n\n## Point 7\n\nOne of the most significant provisions of the decree was Point 7, which established that citizens who were called up for mobilization would be subject to the same terms and conditions as contract soldiers. This meant that mobilized citizens would be entitled to the same pay and benefits as contract soldiers, and would be subject to the same disciplinary procedures.\n\n# Organization\n\n## Text of decree\n\nThe text of the decree established a number of key provisions, including the categories of citizens who would be subject to mobilization, and the procedures for calling up citizens. The decree also established a number of key deadlines, including the date by which citizens were required to report for mobilization.\n\n## Citizens to be mobilized\n\nThe decree established that the following categories of citizens would be subject to mobilization:\n\n* Citizens with military experience, who had previously served in the Russian Armed Forces\n* Citizens who were currently serving in the Russian Armed Forces, but who were not currently deployed in Ukraine\n* Citizens who were currently serving in the Russian National Guard\n* Citizens who were currently serving in the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB)\n\n# Implementation\n\n## Dates\n\nThe decree established a number of key dates, including the date by which citizens were required to report for mobilization. The decree stated that citizens who were called up for mobilization would be required to report for duty within 24 hours of receiving their call-up papers.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## In Russia\n\nThe mobilization was widely criticized in Russia, with many citizens expressing their opposition to the move. A number of protests were held across the country, with demonstrators calling for an end to the conflict in Ukraine and the withdrawal of Russian troops.\n\n### Markets\n\nThe mobilization had a significant impact on Russian markets, with the ruble falling to a record low against the US dollar. The Moscow Stock Exchange also fell sharply, with a number of major Russian companies seeing their share prices decline.\n\n### Russian officials and their families\n\nA number of Russian officials and their families were seen fleeing the country in the days following the mobilization. The move was widely seen as a sign of the growing unease among Russia's elite, who were increasingly concerned about the consequences of the conflict in Ukraine.\n\n### Within the Russian military\n\nThe mobilization was also met with significant resistance within the Russian military. A number of soldiers and officers expressed their opposition to the move, with some refusing to report for duty.\n\n### Help for army conscripts\n\nA number of organizations and individuals offered help to army conscripts, who were facing difficulties in reporting for duty. The move was widely seen as a sign of the growing opposition to the conflict in Ukraine.\n\n### Exodus of Russians\n\nThe mobilization led to an exodus of Russians, with a number of citizens fleeing the country to avoid being called up. The move was widely seen as a sign of the growing unease among Russia's population, who were increasingly concerned about the consequences of the conflict in Ukraine.\n\n### Protests\n\nA number of protests were held across Russia, with demonstrators calling for an end to the conflict in Ukraine and the withdrawal of Russian troops. The protests were widely seen as a sign of the growing opposition to the conflict, and the increasing unease among Russia's population.\n\n### Attacks\n\nA number of attacks were carried out against Russian military recruitment centers, with protesters attempting to disrupt the mobilization process. The move was widely seen as a sign of the growing resistance to the conflict in Ukraine.\n\n## In Ukraine\n\nThe mobilization was widely welcomed in Ukraine, with many Ukrainians seeing it as a sign of Russia's weakness and desperation. The move was also seen as a sign of the growing international pressure on Russia, which was increasingly isolated over its actions in Ukraine.\n\n## International\n\nThe mobilization was widely condemned by the international community, with a number of countries expressing their opposition to the move. The United States, the European Union, and a number of other countries imposed new sanctions on Russia, in response to the mobilization.\n\n# Analysis\n\n## Casualties\n\nThe mobilization is likely to result in significant casualties for Russia, as the country becomes increasingly embroiled in the conflict in Ukraine. The move is also likely to have significant consequences for Russia's economy and population, as the country becomes increasingly isolated and subject to international sanctions.\n\n# See also\n\n* 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* Russo-Ukrainian War\n* Russian military intervention in Ukraine\n* Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation\n\n# Notes\n\n* This article is based on publicly available information, and may not reflect the most up-to-date or accurate information.\n* The article is intended to provide a neutral and informative overview of the 2022 Russian mobilization, and should not be seen as taking a particular position or perspective.\n\n# References", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Russian_mobilization\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics\n##Russia\n###Russian losses\n#Prelude\n##Volunteer recruitment campaign\n##Legislative changes\n##Recruitment of prisoners\n#Putin's speech\n#Decree\n##Official publication and entry into force\n##Point 7\n#Organization\n##Text of decree\n##Citizens to be mobilized\n#Implementation\n##Dates\n#Reactions\n##In Russia\n###Markets\n###Russian officials and their families\n###Within the Russian military\n###Help for army conscripts\n###Exodus of Russians\n###Protests\n###Attacks\n##In Ukraine\n##International\n#Analysis\n##Casualties\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

With a career spanning over five decades, Hersh has established himself as one of the most respected and feared investigative journalists in the world.\n\n#Early life and education\n\nSeymour Hersh was born on April 8, 1937, in Chicago, Illinois, to a family of Jewish immigrants. His parents, Isidor and Dorothy Hersh, owned a dry-cleaning business. Hersh grew up in a middle-class neighborhood in Chicago and developed an interest in journalism at an early age. He attended the University of Chicago, where he studied history and later transferred to the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University, graduating in 1959.\n\n#Newspaper career\n\n##My Lai massacre\n\nHersh began his journalism career as a police reporter for the City News Bureau of Chicago. In 1965, he joined the Associated Press (AP) as a correspondent, covering the Vietnam War. During his time in Vietnam, Hersh uncovered the My Lai massacre, in which American soldiers killed hundreds of unarmed Vietnamese civilians. His reporting on the massacre, which was initially met with skepticism by the U.S. military and government, earned him a Pulitzer Prize in 1970.\n\n##The New York Times\n\nIn 1972, Hersh joined The New York Times as a investigative reporter, where he continued to cover national security and foreign policy issues. His reporting on the CIA's involvement in the overthrow of the Chilean government and the agency's domestic spying operations led to the creation of the Senate's Church Committee, which investigated allegations of government wrongdoing.\n\n#Investigative books: 1980s and 1990s\n\nHersh has written several investigative books, including \"The Price of Power: Kissinger in the Nixon White House\" (1983), \"The Target Is Destroyed: What Really Happened to Flight 007 and What America Knew About It\" (1986), and \"The Samson Option: Israel's Nuclear Arsenal and American Foreign Policy\" (1991). These books, based on extensive research and interviews with key sources, have shed light on some of the most significant and secretive events in recent U.S. history.\n\n#Later investigations\n\n##Iraq and Abu Ghraib\n\nIn 2004, Hersh reported on the abuse of Iraqi prisoners by U.S. soldiers at Abu Ghraib prison, which led to widespread outrage and calls for accountability. His reporting on the Iraq War and its aftermath has been highly critical of the U.S. government's handling of the conflict.\n\n##Iran\n\nHersh has written extensively on the U.S.-Iran conflict, including reports on the CIA's covert operations against the Iranian government and the U.S. military's plans for a potential war with Iran.\n\n##Syria and chemical attacks\n\nIn 2013, Hersh reported on the Syrian government's alleged use of chemical weapons, which led to a U.S. military intervention in the country. His reporting on the issue has been critical of the U.S. government's handling of the crisis.\n\n##Killing of Osama bin Laden\n\nIn 2015, Hersh reported on the U.S. military's operation to kill Osama bin Laden, which he claimed was based on a lie. According to Hersh, the Pakistani government had been holding bin Laden in a safe house and had agreed to let the U.S. kill him in exchange for a large sum of money.\n\n##Nord Stream pipeline and Ukraine\n\nIn 2023, Hersh reported on the U.S. involvement in the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipeline, which he claimed was carried out by the U.S. Navy. His reporting on the issue has been highly critical of the U.S. government's handling of the crisis in Ukraine.\n\n#Other statements\n\n##Speeches\n\nHersh has given several high-profile speeches on national security and foreign policy issues, including a 2013 speech at the University of Pennsylvania, in which he criticized the U.S. government's handling of the Syrian crisis.\n\n##Murder of Seth Rich\n\nIn 2017, Hersh claimed that Seth Rich, a Democratic National Committee staffer who was murdered in 2016, had been in contact with WikiLeaks before his death. Hersh's reporting on the issue has been highly controversial.\n\n##Pat Nixon abuse\n\nIn 2018, Hersh reported on allegations of physical abuse by Pat Nixon, the wife of President Richard Nixon. Hersh's reporting on the issue has been based on interviews with former White House staff members.\n\n#Use of anonymous sources\n\nHersh has been criticized for his use of anonymous sources, which some have argued can be unreliable. However, Hersh has defended his use of anonymous sources, arguing that they are often the only way to get information about sensitive and secretive government programs.\n\n#Personal life\n\nHersh is married to Elizabeth Sarah Klein, a painter and sculptor. They have two children, Matthew and Melissa.

The court ruled that the TVJ trio had indeed trademarked the name \"Eat Bulaga!\" and that TAPE Inc. was not allowed to use the name or format of the show without their permission.\n\n## TV5 and RPTV (since 2024)\n\nIn 2024, E.A.T. moved to TV5 (Associated Broadcasting Company) and RPTV (Radio Philippines Television) after the TVJ trio parted ways with GMA Network.

He is best known for his military career, particularly his role as a companion in arms to Joan of Arc, as well as his later life, which was marked by accusations of child murder and occult practices. De Rais's life and legacy have been the subject of much debate and speculation over the centuries, with some viewing him as a heroic figure and others as a monstrous killer.\n\nHouse of Retz\n-------------\n\n### Early life\n\nGilles de Rais was born in 1404 in the castle of Champtocé-sur-Loire, in the province of Anjou, France. He was the son of Guy de Laval, Lord of Retz, and Marie de Craon, a member of a powerful noble family. De Rais's family was known for their wealth and influence, and he was raised in a life of luxury and privilege.\n\n### Matrimonial projects\n\nIn 1416, de Rais was betrothed to Catherine de Thouars, a member of a prominent noble family. However, the marriage was never consummated, and de Rais eventually broke off the engagement. This led to a series of disputes with the Thouars family, which would continue for many years.\n\n### Family disputes\n\nDe Rais's family was also involved in a number of disputes with other noble families, including the powerful House of Valois-Anjou. These disputes often centered on issues of land ownership and inheritance, and de Rais was frequently involved in the negotiations and conflicts that arose.\n\n### Titles, estates and wealth\n\nThroughout his life, de Rais accumulated a number of titles and estates, including the Lordship of Retz, which he inherited from his father. He also acquired a number of other properties, including the castle of Champtocé-sur-Loire, which became one of his primary residences. De Rais's wealth and influence continued to grow throughout his life, and he became one of the most powerful nobles in western France.\n\nMilitary career\n--------------\n\n### First hypothetical feat of arms\n\nDe Rais's military career began in the early 1420s, when he participated in a number of campaigns against the English, who had occupied large parts of France. One of his earliest recorded military actions was the capture of the castle of Château-Gontier, which he accomplished through a clever ruse.\n\n### Franco-Breton alliance through the House of Valois-Anjou\n\nIn 1425, de Rais formed an alliance with the House of Valois-Anjou, which was a powerful noble family that controlled much of western France. This alliance helped to secure de Rais's position as a major military leader and paved the way for his future successes.\n\n### Guerilla warfare against English garrisons on the borders of Maine\n\nDe Rais's military career was marked by a number of campaigns against the English, who had established a number of garrisons along the borders of Maine. De Rais used guerrilla tactics to great effect, launching surprise attacks on English forces and disrupting their supply lines.\n\n### Companion in arms with Joan of Arc\n\nOne of de Rais's most famous military campaigns was his participation in the siege of Orléans, where he fought alongside Joan of Arc. De Rais was one of the leaders of the French forces, and he played a key role in the eventual lifting of the siege.\n\n### Civil wars between La Trémoille and Richemont's allies\n\nIn the late 1420s, de Rais became embroiled in a series of civil wars between the supporters of Georges de la Trémoille and those of Arthur de Richemont. De Rais eventually allied himself with Richemont, who would later become one of the most powerful nobles in France.\n\n### Lifting of the siege of Lagny\n\nIn 1431, de Rais participated in the siege of Lagny, which was a strategic town in eastern France. De Rais played a key role in the eventual lifting of the siege, which helped to secure a major victory for the French.\n\n### Reduction of military commitments\n\nIn the late 1430s, de Rais began to reduce his military commitments, focusing instead on his life as a noble and a landowner. This marked the beginning of a new phase in his life, one that would be marked by increasing controversy and scandal.\n\nSquandering of heritage\n---------------------\n\nThroughout his life, de Rais was known for his lavish spending and his love of luxury. He accumulated a number of debts, which eventually led to the loss of many of his titles and estates. This marked a significant decline in de Rais's fortunes, one that would have far-reaching consequences.\n\nCriminal life\n-------------\n\n### Occult involvement\n\nDe Rais's later life was marked by a number of allegations of occult practices, including the use of magic and the worship of demons. These allegations were often used as evidence against him during his trial.\n\n### Child murders\n\nIn 1440, de Rais was accused of a number of child murders, which were said to have taken place at his castle in Champtocé-sur-Loire. The allegations were shocking and helped to seal de Rais's fate.\n\n### Act of force in Saint-Étienne-de-Mer-Morte\n\nIn 1440, de Rais was involved in an act of force in the town of Saint-Étienne-de-Mer-Morte, where he seized a number of properties and intimidated the local population. This marked a significant escalation in de Rais's behavior, one that would eventually lead to his downfall.\n\n### Ecclesiastical and secular investigations\n\nDe Rais's actions eventually came to the attention of both ecclesiastical and secular authorities, who launched a number of investigations into his behavior. These investigations helped to build a case against de Rais, one that would ultimately lead to his trial and execution.\n\n### Trial and execution\n\nIn 1440, de Rais was put on trial for his alleged crimes, including the child murders and occult practices. The trial was highly publicized and helped to seal de Rais's fate. He was eventually found guilty and executed, marking the end of a long and tumultuous life.\n\nQuestion of guilt\n----------------\n\n### Doubts about the verdict in the Age of Enlightenment tradition\n\nIn the centuries following de Rais's execution, many began to question the verdict, citing concerns about the fairness of the trial and the reliability of the evidence. This marked a significant shift in attitudes towards de Rais, one that would continue to evolve over time.\n\n### Occultist interpretations\n\nSome have interpreted de Rais's life and crimes through the lens of occultism, seeing him as a practitioner of dark magic and a worshipper of demons. This interpretation has been the subject of much debate and speculation.\n\n### Georges Bataille's interpretations\n\nThe French philosopher Georges Bataille wrote extensively about de Rais, interpreting his life and crimes as a form of \"sacred violence\". This interpretation has been influential in shaping modern attitudes towards de Rais.\n\n### 1992 mock re-trial\n\nIn 1992, a mock re-trial of de Rais was held in France, which helped to shed new light on the case and raise further questions about de Rais's guilt.\n\n### Contemporary academic views\n\nToday, many academics view de Rais as a complex and multifaceted figure, whose life and crimes cannot be reduced to simple explanations. This marks a significant shift in attitudes towards de Rais, one that recognizes the complexity and nuance of his case.\n\nFictional portraits\n------------------\n\nDe Rais has been the subject of numerous fictional portraits, including literature, film, and art. These portraits often reflect the changing attitudes towards de Rais over time, and help to shape public perceptions of his life and crimes.\n\nPsychopathological interpretations\n---------------------------------\n\n### Fin de siècle portrayals\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, de Rais was often portrayed as a monstrous figure, a symbol of the decadence and depravity of the nobility. This portrayal has been influential in shaping modern attitudes towards de Rais.\n\n### Classification as a serial killer\n\nSome have classified de Rais as a serial killer, citing the number of alleged victims and the pattern of his crimes. This classification has been the subject of much debate and speculation.\n\nGilles de Rais and the Bluebeard myth\n-------------------------------------\n\nDe Rais's life and crimes have been linked to the Bluebeard myth, which tells the story of a nobleman who murders his wives. This myth has been influential in shaping public perceptions of de Rais, and continues to be referenced in literature and art.\n\nRelationship with Joan of Arc\n-----------------------------\n\nDe Rais's relationship with Joan of Arc has been the subject of much speculation and debate. Some have seen their relationship as a deep and meaningful one, while others have viewed it as a mere alliance of convenience.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* List of serial killers\n* List of people executed by hanging\n* List of people executed by beheading\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n### Notes\n\n* 1. \"Gilles de Rais\" by Georges Bataille\n* 2. \"The Trial of Gilles de Rais\" by G.

The election was necessary due to the retirement of incumbent Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Republican Party gaining control of the House of Representatives in the 2022 midterm elections.\n\n# Process and conventions\n\nThe Speaker of the House is elected by a majority vote of the members of the House of Representatives, with each member typically voting for their party's nominee. The election is presided over by the Dean of the House, the longest-serving member of the House, or the Clerk of the House if the Dean is not present. In this case, the Clerk of the House, Cheryl Johnson, presided over the election.\n\nThe election process typically involves each party nominating a candidate, with the majority party's nominee usually winning the speakership. However, in this case, the Republican Party's nominee, Kevin McCarthy, faced opposition from a group of conservative Republicans, leading to a prolonged and contentious election process.\n\n# Democratic nomination\n\nThe Democratic Party, being in the minority, did not have a realistic chance of winning the speakership. However, they still nominated a candidate as a matter of procedure and to provide an alternative to the Republican nominee.\n\n## Candidates\n\n### Nominee\n\nHakeem Jeffries, the Chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, was unanimously nominated by the Democratic Party as their candidate for Speaker.\n\n### Declined to run\n\nSeveral senior Democrats, including Steny Hoyer and Jim Clyburn, declined to run for Speaker, paving the way for Jeffries to become the nominee.\n\n## Result\n\nJeffries was nominated by acclamation, with all Democratic members present voting for him.\n\n# Republican nomination\n\nThe Republican Party, being in the majority, had a realistic chance of winning the speakership. However, their nominee, Kevin McCarthy, faced opposition from a group of conservative Republicans.\n\n## Candidates\n\n### Nominee\n\nKevin McCarthy, the House Minority Leader, was nominated by the Republican Party as their candidate for Speaker.\n\n### Lost nomination\n\nSeveral conservative Republicans, including Matt Gaetz and Lauren Boebert, opposed McCarthy's nomination and voted against him in the Republican conference.\n\n## Results\n\nMcCarthy won the Republican nomination, but with significant opposition from conservative members.\n\n# Election of the speaker\n\n## Background\n\nThe election of the Speaker is typically a formality, with the majority party's nominee winning easily. However, in this case, McCarthy faced opposition from a group of conservative Republicans, leading to a prolonged and contentious election process.\n\n## Candidates\n\nTwo candidates were nominated for Speaker: Kevin McCarthy (Republican) and Hakeem Jeffries (Democrat).\n\n## Summary\n\nThe election process involved 15 ballots, with McCarthy eventually winning on the 15th ballot. Jeffries received consistent support from Democratic members, but was unable to win due to the Republican majority.\n\n## Ballots 1–3 (January 3)\n\nThe first three ballots were held on January 3, with McCarthy receiving 203 votes, Jeffries receiving 212 votes, and several Republican members voting for other candidates or abstaining.\n\n## Ballots 4–6 (January 4)\n\nThe next three ballots were held on January 4, with McCarthy receiving 201 votes, Jeffries receiving 213 votes, and the opposition to McCarthy growing among conservative Republicans.\n\n## Ballots 7–11 (January 5)\n\nThe next five ballots were held on January 5, with McCarthy receiving 201-203 votes, Jeffries receiving 212-213 votes, and the opposition to McCarthy continuing to grow.\n\n## Ballots 12–15 (January 6)\n\nThe final four ballots were held on January 6, with McCarthy eventually winning on the 15th ballot, receiving 216 votes to Jeffries' 212 votes.\n\n## All ballots: votes not cast for party nominee\n\nSeveral Republican members voted against McCarthy on various ballots, including Matt Gaetz, Lauren Boebert, and Scott Perry.\n\n## All ballots: summary of votes\n\nMcCarthy received 201-203 votes on most ballots, with Jeffries receiving 212-213 votes. The opposition to McCarthy grew among conservative Republicans, but he eventually won on the 15th ballot.\n\n# Impact\n\n## Historical context\n\nThe January 2023 Speaker election was the first time in 100 years that the Speaker was not elected on the first ballot. The prolonged and contentious election process reflected the deep divisions within the Republican Party.\n\n## Consequences while there was no speaker\n\nThe lack of a Speaker for several days had significant consequences, including the inability to swear in new members, conduct legislative business, and receive classified intelligence briefings.\n\n## C-SPAN popularity\n\nThe prolonged Speaker election led to a surge in popularity for C-SPAN, with millions of viewers tuning in to watch the proceedings live.\n\n# See also\n\n* 2022 United States House of Representatives elections\n* 118th United States Congress\n* Speaker of the United States House of Representatives\n\n# Notes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"January_2023_Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives_election\" following this outline:\n\n#Process and conventions\n#Democratic nomination\n##Candidates\n###Nominee\n###Declined to run\n##Result\n#Republican nomination\n##Candidates\n###Nominee\n###Lost nomination\n##Results\n#Election of the speaker\n##Background\n##Candidates\n##Summary\n##Ballots 1–3 (January 3)\n##Ballots 4–6 (January 4)\n##Ballots 7–11 (January 5)\n##Ballots 12–15 (January 6)\n##All ballots: votes not cast for party nominee\n##All ballots: summary of votes\n#Impact\n##Historical context\n##Consequences while there was no speaker\n##C-SPAN popularity\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This period saw a significant revival of interest in classical Greek and Roman art and culture, which had a profound impact on the development of sculpture in Italy. Italian Renaissance sculpture is characterized by its naturalism, humanism, and technical skill, and is considered one of the greatest achievements of the Renaissance.\n\n# Periods\n\nItalian Renaissance sculpture can be broadly divided into three periods: the Early Renaissance (14th-15th centuries), the High Renaissance (15th-16th centuries), and the Late Renaissance (16th-17th centuries). Each period saw significant developments in style, technique, and patronage.\n\n# Materials\n\nItalian Renaissance sculptors worked with a variety of materials, each with its own unique characteristics and challenges.\n\n## Stone\n\nStone was a popular material for sculpture during the Italian Renaissance, particularly marble, which was prized for its beauty and durability. Sculptors such as Michelangelo and Bernini worked extensively with marble, creating iconic works like the Pietà and David. Other types of stone, such as limestone and sandstone, were also used, particularly for architectural sculpture.\n\n## Metal\n\nMetal was another important material for Italian Renaissance sculpture, particularly bronze. Bronze was highly valued for its durability and versatility, and was often used for small-scale sculptures, such as figurines and medals. Sculptors like Donatello and Cellini were renowned for their skill in bronze casting.\n\n## Wood\n\nWood was a less common material for sculpture during the Italian Renaissance, but was still used for certain types of works, such as wooden crucifixes and reliquaries. Wood was also used for architectural sculpture, particularly for decorative elements like carved doors and panels.\n\n## Terracotta\n\nTerracotta was a popular material for sculpture during the Italian Renaissance, particularly for small-scale works like figurines and decorative objects. Terracotta was often used for architectural sculpture, particularly for decorative elements like glazed tiles and ornaments.\n\n## Other materials\n\nOther materials, such as ivory, bone, and wax, were also used for sculpture during the Italian Renaissance. These materials were often used for small-scale works, such as figurines and decorative objects.\n\n## Coloured sculpture\n\nColoured sculpture was a significant development during the Italian Renaissance, particularly in the 16th century. Sculptors like Michelangelo and Bernini experimented with colour, using techniques like glazing and painting to add vibrancy to their works.\n\n# Settings\n\nItalian Renaissance sculpture was created for a variety of settings, from churches and tombs to civic spaces and private residences.\n\n## Churches and tombs\n\nChurches and tombs were important settings for Italian Renaissance sculpture, particularly for works like altarpieces and funerary monuments. Sculptors like Donatello and Michelangelo created iconic works for churches and tombs, such as the bronze pulpits for the Cathedral of Siena and the Medici Chapel in Florence.\n\n## Civic pride\n\nCivic pride was a significant factor in the creation of Italian Renaissance sculpture, particularly for works like fountains and public monuments. Sculptors like Bernini and Borromini created iconic works for civic spaces, such as the Fountain of the Four Rivers in Rome and the Palazzo Barberini in Rome.\n\n### Fountains\n\nFountains were a popular type of civic sculpture during the Italian Renaissance, particularly in the 16th and 17th centuries. Sculptors like Bernini and Borromini created iconic fountains for civic spaces, such as the Fountain of the Four Rivers in Rome and the Piazza Navona in Rome.\n\n## Portraits\n\nPortraits were a significant type of Italian Renaissance sculpture, particularly in the 16th century. Sculptors like Michelangelo and Bernini created iconic portraits, such as the bust of Julius II and the bust of Louis XIV.\n\n### Equestrian statues\n\nEquestrian statues were a popular type of portrait sculpture during the Italian Renaissance, particularly in the 16th century. Sculptors like Verrocchio and Donatello created iconic equestrian statues, such as the Colleoni in Venice and the Gattamelata in Padua.\n\n### Shoulder busts\n\nShoulder busts were a popular type of portrait sculpture during the Italian Renaissance, particularly in the 16th century. Sculptors like Michelangelo and Bernini created iconic shoulder busts, such as the bust of Julius II and the bust of Louis XIV.\n\n### Medals\n\nMedals were a significant type of portrait sculpture during the Italian Renaissance, particularly in the 15th and 16th centuries. Sculptors like Pisanello and Caradosso created iconic medals, such as the medal of Alfonso V of Aragon and the medal of Emperor Maximilian I.\n\n## Small sculpture\n\nSmall sculpture was a significant type of Italian Renaissance sculpture, particularly in the 15th and 16th centuries. Sculptors like Donatello and Cellini created iconic small sculptures, such as figurines and decorative objects.\n\n# Workshops\n\nItalian Renaissance sculpture workshops were important centers of artistic production, where sculptors and their assistants worked together to create works of art.\n\n## Women sculptors\n\nWomen sculptors were a rare but significant presence in Italian Renaissance sculpture workshops. Women like Properzia de' Rossi and Sofonisba Anguissola worked as sculptors and created iconic works, such as the sculptures for the Cathedral of Bologna and the portraits of the Duchess of Milan.\n\n# Guilds\n\nGuilds played an important role in the production and dissemination of Italian Renaissance sculpture. Sculptors were often members of guilds, which regulated the production and sale of sculpture.\n\n# Patrons\n\nPatrons were essential to the creation of Italian Renaissance sculpture, providing financial support and artistic guidance to sculptors. Patrons like the Medici family and the Pope were significant supporters of sculpture, commissioning iconic works like the David and the Pietà.\n\n# Development of style\n\nItalian Renaissance sculpture developed over several centuries, influenced by a range of artistic and cultural factors.\n\n## To 1400\n\nItalian Renaissance sculpture before 1400 was characterized by a mix of Gothic and classical influences. Sculptors like Nicola Pisano and Arnolfo di Cambio created iconic works, such as the Pulpit of the Baptistery in Pisa and the Façade of the Cathedral of Siena.\n\n## From 1400\n\n### Doors of the Florence Baptistery\n\nThe Doors of the Florence Baptistery, created by Lorenzo Ghiberti between 1403 and 1425, were a significant milestone in the development of Italian Renaissance sculpture. The doors, which depicted scenes from the Old Testament, were renowned for their naturalism and technical skill.\n\n### Donatello\n\nDonatello was a key figure in the development of Italian Renaissance sculpture, particularly in the 15th century. His works, such as the bronze David and the marble St. George, were renowned for their naturalism and emotional intensity.\n\n### Middle of the century\n\nThe middle of the 15th century saw significant developments in Italian Renaissance sculpture, particularly in the work of sculptors like Andrea del Verrocchio and Antonio Pollaiuolo. Their works, such as the Colleoni and the Hercules and Antaeus, were renowned for their naturalism and technical skill.\n\n### Lombardy\n\nLombardy was a significant center of Italian Renaissance sculpture, particularly in the 15th and 16th centuries. Sculptors like Cristoforo Mantegazza and Andrea Fusina created iconic works, such as the sculptures for the Cathedral of Milan and the Certosa di Pavia.\n\n### Crisis of the 1490s\n\nThe crisis of the 1490s, which saw the French invasion of Italy and the rise of the Dominican friar Savonarola, had a significant impact on Italian Renaissance sculpture.

From its humble beginnings as a Jewish sect, Christianity spread rapidly throughout the Mediterranean world, eventually becoming the dominant faith of the Western world. This article will explore the major periods and developments in the history of Christianity, from the early days of the apostles to the present day.\n\n# Early Christianity\n\n## Jewish background\n\nChristianity emerged from the Jewish tradition in the 1st century AD. The Jewish people had a long history of faith in one God, and their scriptures, the Hebrew Bible, told the story of God's relationship with his people. Jesus of Nazareth, a Jewish teacher and preacher, was born in Bethlehem around 4 BC and grew up in Nazareth. His teachings emphasized the importance of love, forgiveness, and compassion, and he attracted a large following of Jews and non-Jews alike.\n\n## Apostolic Age (c. 30–100)\n\n### Developing church structure\n\nAfter Jesus' death and resurrection, his followers, now known as Christians, began to organize themselves into a community. The apostles, led by Peter and Paul, played a key role in the early church, serving as leaders, teachers, and missionaries. The Jerusalem church, led by James, the brother of Jesus, was the center of the early Christian movement.\n\n### Early growth\n\nThe early Christian church grew rapidly, with new converts coming from both Jewish and Gentile (non-Jewish) backgrounds. The apostles traveled extensively, preaching and establishing churches throughout the Mediterranean world. The church in Antioch, Syria, became a major center of Christianity, and it was there that the disciples were first called Christians.\n\n## Ante-Nicene period (100–312)\n\n### Scripture\n\nDuring this period, the Christian scriptures, including the Gospels and the Epistles of Paul, began to take shape. The process of canonization, or the formation of the authoritative texts of the Bible, was underway. The earliest known Christian writings, such as the Gospel of Mark and the Epistle of James, date from this period.\n\n### Early Christian art\n\nEarly Christian art emerged during this period, with the use of symbols such as the cross, the fish, and the Chi-Rho (a combination of the Greek letters X and P, representing the first two letters of Christ's name in Greek). These symbols were used to convey the message of Christianity in a way that was both subtle and powerful.\n\n### Persecutions and legalization\n\nThe early Christian church faced persecution from both Jewish and Roman authorities. Christians were seen as a threat to the established order, and many were martyred for their faith. However, with the Edict of Milan in 313 AD, Christianity was legalized, and the church was free to worship and spread its message openly.\n\n## Spread of Christianity to c. 300 AD\n\n### Inclusivity, women and exclusivity\n\nChristianity was inclusive from its early days, welcoming people from all walks of life, including women, slaves, and Gentiles. Women played a significant role in the early church, serving as leaders, teachers, and missionaries. However, as the church grew and became more institutionalized, women's roles became more limited.\n\n### Moral practices\n\nEarly Christians were known for their high moral standards, including their rejection of idolatry, immorality, and violence. They believed in the importance of love, forgiveness, and compassion, and they sought to live out these values in their daily lives.\n\n# Late antiquity (313–476)\n\n## Conversion of Constantine\n\nIn 312 AD, the Roman Emperor Constantine converted to Christianity, marking a significant turning point in the history of the faith. Constantine's conversion led to the establishment of Christianity as the official state church of the Roman Empire.\n\n### Christianity and the state\n\nThe relationship between Christianity and the state was complex and often contentious. While some Christians welcomed the support of the state, others saw it as a threat to their independence and integrity.\n\n### Christianity and polytheism\n\nAs Christianity spread throughout the Roman Empire, it encountered a variety of polytheistic cults and traditions. Christians saw themselves as the sole possessors of truth, and they often viewed other religions as idolatrous and false.\n\n## Augustine's ethic toward Jews\n\nThe Christian theologian Augustine of Hippo (354-430 AD) developed a complex and often contradictory ethic toward Jews. While he rejected the idea of forced conversion, he also saw Jews as responsible for the crucifixion of Jesus and advocated for their subjugation.\n\n## Developing orthodoxy and heresy\n\nAs Christianity spread, different interpretations of the faith emerged, leading to the development of orthodoxy (right doctrine) and heresy (wrong doctrine). The early church councils, such as the Council of Nicaea (325 AD) and the Council of Constantinople (381 AD), played a key role in establishing the boundaries of orthodoxy.\n\n## Church of the East\n\nThe Church of the East, also known as the Assyrian Church, emerged in the 2nd century AD and became a major center of Christianity in the Middle East. The church developed its own distinct traditions and practices, including the use of the Syriac language.\n\n## Hospitals\n\nThe early Christian church established hospitals and other charitable institutions to care for the sick and the poor. These institutions played a significant role in the development of Western medicine and social welfare.\n\n## Art and literature\n\nEarly Christian art and literature flourished during this period, with the development of new forms and styles. The works of writers such as St. Augustine and St. Jerome helped to shape the intellectual and spiritual landscape of Western Christianity.\n\n## Spread and growth of Christianity\n\n### Christianity in the Roman Africa province\n\nChristianity spread rapidly throughout the Roman province of Africa (modern-day Tunisia, Algeria, and parts of Morocco). The church in Carthage, led by St. Cyprian, became a major center of Christianity.\n\n### German Europe, Britain and Ireland\n\nChristianity spread to German Europe, Britain, and Ireland through the missionary work of monks and priests. The conversion of the Anglo-Saxon king Ethelbert of Kent in 597 AD marked the beginning of Christianity in England.\n\n### Asia\n\nChristianity spread to Asia through the missionary work of the apostle Thomas and other early Christian missionaries. The church in India, known as the St. Thomas Christians, developed its own distinct traditions and practices.\n\n# Early Middle Ages (476–842)\n\n## Justinian I\n\nThe Byzantine Emperor Justinian I (527-565 AD) played a significant role in the development of Eastern Orthodoxy. He oversaw the construction of the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople and the codification of Roman law.\n\n## Education\n\nThe early Christian church placed a high value on education, establishing schools and universities throughout Europe. The University of Al-Karaouine in Morocco, founded in 859 AD, is considered the oldest continuously operating university in the world.\n\n## Law\n\nThe early Christian church developed its own system of law, based on the principles of the Bible and the teachings of the early church fathers. The Decretum Gratiani, a collection of canon law, was published in the 12th century.\n\n## Monasticism\n\nMonasticism emerged in the early Christian church as a way of life dedicated to prayer, study, and service. Monasteries became centers of learning, art, and spirituality.\n\n## Art\n\nEarly medieval art flourished during this period, with the development of new forms and styles. The illuminated manuscripts of the Lindisfarne Gospels and the Book of Kells are famous examples of early medieval art.\n\n## Papal supremacy\n\nThe concept of papal supremacy, or the idea that the Pope has ultimate authority over the church, emerged during this period. The Pope's role as the successor of St. Peter and the bishop of Rome was seen as the basis for his authority.\n\n## Spread and growth of Christianity\n\nChristianity continued to spread throughout Europe, with the conversion of the Slavs and the establishment of the church in Russia.

The Renaissance, a cultural and artistic movement, emerged in the 14th century.\n\n### Universities\n\nThe universities of Oxford and Cambridge, founded in the 12th and 13th centuries, became major centers of learning and intellectual inquiry.\n\n### Art, architecture and music\n\nThe High Middle Ages saw the development of new forms and styles in art, architecture, and music.

The movie stars Dev, Rukmini Maitra, and Subhashree Ganguly in lead roles.\n\nPlot\n-----\n\nThe film is set in the early 20th century and revolves around the life of Khudiram Bose, a young Bengali revolutionary who becomes involved in the Indian independence movement against British colonial rule. The story follows Khudiram's transformation from a common man to a freedom fighter, as he witnesses the atrocities committed by the British and decides to take a stand against them.\n\nThe film explores Khudiram's relationships with his family and friends, as well as his encounters with other revolutionaries, including Prafulla Chaki and Bagha Jatin. The movie also delves into the personal struggles and sacrifices made by Khudiram and his fellow revolutionaries in their fight for independence.\n\nCast\n-----\n\n* Dev as Khudiram Bose\n* Rukmini Maitra as Priya\n* Subhashree Ganguly as Leela\n* Saurav Das as Prafulla Chaki\n* Joy Mukherjee as Bagha Jatin\n* Kharaj Mukherjee as Khudiram's father\n* Bhola Tamang as a British officer\n\nProduction\n------------\n\n### Development and Pre-production\n\nThe idea for Chengiz was first conceived by director Raj Chakraborty in 2019, when he began researching the life of Khudiram Bose and the Indian independence movement. Chakraborty was fascinated by Khudiram's story and saw potential for a film that would showcase the struggles and sacrifices made by Bengali revolutionaries during that period.\n\nAfter several months of research and script development, Chakraborty approached producer Dev with the idea for the film. Dev was impressed by the script and agreed to produce the movie under his banner, Dev Entertainment Ventures.\n\n### Casting\n\nThe casting process for Chengiz began in early 2020, with Dev being the first actor to be cast in the lead role of Khudiram Bose. Rukmini Maitra and Subhashree Ganguly were later cast as the female leads, while Saurav Das, Joy Mukherjee, and Kharaj Mukherjee were cast in supporting roles.\n\nSoundtrack\n------------\n\nThe soundtrack for Chengiz was composed by Indraadip Dasgupta, with lyrics written by Srijit Mukherji and Priyo Chatterjee. The album features five tracks, including the title song \"Chengiz\", which was released as a single in February 2023.\n\nMarketing\n------------\n\nThe marketing campaign for Chengiz began in January 2023, with the release of a teaser trailer that showcased the film's historical setting and action sequences. The trailer received a positive response from audiences and generated buzz around the movie.\n\nIn the following weeks, the film's cast and crew participated in several promotional events, including press conferences and interviews. The movie's social media accounts were also active, with regular updates and behind-the-scenes content being shared with fans.\n\nRelease\n---------\n\n### Theatrical\n\nChengiz was released in theaters on March 17, 2023, in West Bengal and other parts of India. The film received a wide release, with over 200 screens in West Bengal alone.\n\n### Screenings and statistics\n\nChengiz was screened at several film festivals, including the Kolkata International Film Festival and the Indian Film Festival of Melbourne. The movie also received a special screening at the Indian Parliament in New Delhi, which was attended by several politicians and dignitaries.\n\nAccording to box office reports, Chengiz opened to a strong start, with collections of over ₹1 crore on its opening day in West Bengal. The film went on to gross over ₹5 crore in its opening weekend, making it one of the highest-grossing Bengali films of 2023.\n\nReception\n------------\n\n### Critical response\n\nChengiz received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for its historical setting, action sequences, and performances. The film's direction and screenplay were also commended, with several critics noting that the movie was a fitting tribute to Khudiram Bose and the Indian independence movement.\n\nHowever, some critics felt that the film's pacing was uneven and that the supporting characters were underdeveloped. The movie's music and cinematography were also praised, with several critics noting that the film's visuals and sound design were of high quality.\n\n### Box office\n\nAs of April 2023, Chengiz has grossed over ₹10 crore at the box office, making it one of the highest-grossing Bengali films of 2023. The movie's success can be attributed to its strong word-of-mouth and positive reviews from critics.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nExternal links\n---------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Chengiz\" following this outline:\n\n#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production\n##Development and Pre-production\n##Casting\n#Soundtrack\n#Marketing\n#Release\n##Theatrical\n##Screenings and statistics\n#Reception\n##Critical response\n##Box office\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The novel is a sprawling, complex work that defies easy categorization, blending elements of historical fiction, philosophical treatise, and personal memoir. Spanning over 1,000 pages, it is considered one of the most ambitious and important works of 20th-century German literature.\n\nPlot\n-----\n\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance is set in the 1930s and 1940s, against the backdrop of the rise of fascism in Europe. The novel follows a group of young, working-class men in Berlin, who are drawn into the anti-fascist resistance movement. As the story unfolds, the characters find themselves increasingly embroiled in the struggles of the time, from the Spanish Civil War to the early years of World War II.\n\nThe novel's narrative is non-linear, jumping back and forth in time and blurring the lines between reality and fiction. Weiss's characters are often fragmented and disjointed, reflecting the chaos and dislocation of the era. Through their experiences, Weiss explores themes of resistance, revolution, and the role of art in shaping our understanding of the world.\n\nForm features and structure\n---------------------------\n\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance is divided into three volumes, each with its own distinct structure and narrative focus. The novel is characterized by its use of multiple narrative voices, including first-person and third-person narration, as well as extensive use of dialogue and internal monologue.\n\nThe novel's structure is also notable for its use of montage, a technique borrowed from film and avant-garde art. Weiss juxtaposes disparate elements – historical events, personal anecdotes, philosophical musings – to create a kaleidoscopic portrait of the era. This approach allows Weiss to convey the complexity and multiplicity of human experience, as well as the interconnectedness of historical events.\n\nHistory of origins and publication\n---------------------------------\n\n### Beginning\n\nWeiss began working on The Aesthetics of Resistance in the early 1960s, during a period of intense creative ferment. He was drawn to the subject of anti-fascist resistance, inspired by his own experiences as a young man in Sweden during World War II.\n\n### Research\n\nWeiss's research for the novel was extensive, involving years of reading, interviewing, and traveling. He drew on a wide range of sources, from historical texts to personal accounts, in order to recreate the world of the 1930s and 1940s.\n\n### Writer's block\n\nDespite his extensive research, Weiss struggled with writer's block, unsure of how to shape his material into a coherent narrative. He eventually broke through the impasse by adopting a more experimental approach, embracing the fragmented and disjointed nature of his characters' experiences.\n\n### The third volume\n\nThe third volume of The Aesthetics of Resistance was published in 1981, six years after the second volume. Weiss had initially planned to conclude the novel with the second volume, but he ultimately decided to add a third volume, which explored the aftermath of World War II and the early years of the Cold War.\n\n### Sweden and the GDR\n\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance was published in both Sweden and the German Democratic Republic (GDR), where Weiss had lived and worked for many years. The novel was widely acclaimed in both countries, with many critics praising its ambitious scope and innovative style.\n\n### Other translations\n\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance has been translated into numerous languages, including English, French, Spanish, and Italian. The novel has also been widely reviewed and discussed in international literary circles, with many critics recognizing its importance as a work of 20th-century literature.\n\nTextual forms\n-------------\n\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance is characterized by its use of multiple textual forms, including diary entries, letters, and newspaper articles. Weiss also incorporates elements of poetry and drama, blurring the lines between different literary genres.\n\nArtists and artworks in the novel\n--------------------------------\n\n### Divine Comedy\n\nWeiss's novel is structured around a series of references to Dante's Divine Comedy, which serves as a kind of meta-textual framework for the narrative.

The UPA was formed in 1942 as a military wing of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN), which had been fighting for Ukrainian independence since the 1920s. This article provides an overview of the UPA's anti-Soviet resistance, from its creation to its final suppression in the late 1940s.\n\n# Background\n\n## Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists\n\nThe Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) was a Ukrainian nationalist organization founded in 1929 by a group of Ukrainian intellectuals and politicians. The OUN's primary goal was to achieve Ukrainian independence from Poland and the Soviet Union, which had occupied Ukraine since the end of World War I. The OUN was influenced by fascist and nationalist ideologies, and its leaders, including Stepan Bandera, were known for their radical views.\n\n## Outbreak of the war\n\nIn September 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union invaded Poland, which led to the division of Ukraine between the two powers. The OUN saw this as an opportunity to promote Ukrainian independence and began to cooperate with the Germans. However, the OUN's relationship with the Germans was complicated, and the organization's leaders were eventually arrested and imprisoned.\n\n## Creation of OUN-B, pogroms, and anti-Soviet uprising\n\nIn 1940, a faction of the OUN, known as OUN-B, was formed, led by Stepan Bandera. OUN-B was more radical than the original OUN and advocated for the use of violence to achieve Ukrainian independence. In June 1941, Germany launched a surprise attack on the Soviet Union, and the OUN-B saw this as an opportunity to launch an anti-Soviet uprising. The OUN-B organized a series of pogroms against Jews and other minorities, which led to the deaths of tens of thousands of people.\n\n## Creation of UPA, anti-German uprising, and extermination of Poles\n\nIn 1942, the OUN-B formed the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA), which was led by Roman Shukhevych. The UPA's primary goal was to fight against the Soviet Union and establish an independent Ukrainian state. However, the UPA also launched an anti-German uprising, which led to clashes with German forces. The UPA also engaged in the extermination of Poles, particularly in the region of Volhynia, where tens of thousands of Poles were killed.\n\n# Armed resistance during the war (1944–1945)\n\n## Fights in Volhynia and Podolia (first half of 1944)\n\nIn the first half of 1944, the UPA engaged in a series of battles with Soviet forces in Volhynia and Podolia. The UPA's military strategy was to launch surprise attacks on Soviet units and then retreat into the forests and mountains. The UPA also used guerrilla tactics, such as ambushes and sabotage, to disrupt Soviet supply lines.\n\n## After German expulsion from Ukraine\n\nIn the summer of 1944, the Germans were expelled from Ukraine, and the Soviet Union began to reassert its control over the country. The UPA continued to fight against the Soviet Union, but its military situation became increasingly difficult.\n\n### Battle of Zaliznytsia (28 April 1944)\n\nOn 28 April 1944, the UPA engaged in a battle with Soviet forces at Zaliznytsia, a town in western Ukraine. The UPA was defeated, and its commander, Roman Shukhevych, was wounded.\n\n### Battle of Piryatin (19 August 1944)\n\nOn 19 August 1944, the UPA engaged in a battle with Soviet forces at Piryatin, a town in central Ukraine. The UPA was defeated, and its commander, Petro Oliynyk, was killed.\n\n### Battle of Karov (29–30 August 1944)\n\nOn 29–30 August 1944, the UPA engaged in a battle with Soviet forces at Karov, a village in western Ukraine. The UPA was defeated, and its commander, Mykola Lebed, was wounded.\n\n### Battle of Urman village (17 September 1944)\n\nOn 17 September 1944, the UPA engaged in a battle with Soviet forces at Urman village, a village in western Ukraine. The UPA was defeated, and its commander, Roman Shukhevych, was killed.\n\n### Battle of Univ (30 September–1 October 1944)\n\nOn 30 September–1 October 1944, the UPA engaged in a battle with Soviet forces at Univ, a village in western Ukraine. The UPA was defeated, and its commander, Petro Oliynyk, was killed.\n\n### Battle of Leszczawa Górna (28 October 1944)\n\nOn 28 October 1944, the UPA engaged in a battle with Soviet forces at Leszczawa Górna, a village in western Ukraine. The UPA was defeated, and its commander, Mykola Lebed, was wounded.\n\n### Impeding mobilization of Ukrainians to the Red Army\n\nThe UPA also engaged in a campaign to impede the mobilization of Ukrainians to the Red Army. The UPA used propaganda and intimidation to discourage Ukrainians from joining the Red Army.\n\n### Attacks on cities in 1944\n\nThe UPA also launched a series of attacks on cities in Ukraine, including Kiev, Kharkov, and Odessa. The UPA's goal was to disrupt the Soviet war effort and to promote Ukrainian independence.\n\n### Attacks on the railways\n\nThe UPA also launched a series of attacks on the railways in Ukraine. The UPA's goal was to disrupt the Soviet war effort and to promote Ukrainian independence.\n\n## Fights in 1945\n\n### Elimination of \"Klim Savur\"\n\nIn January 1945, the UPA eliminated \"Klim Savur,\" a Soviet agent who had infiltrated the UPA. The UPA's elimination of \"Klim Savur\" was a significant blow to the Soviet Union's efforts to infiltrate and disrupt the UPA.\n\n### UPA attacks on cities in 1945\n\nThe UPA also launched a series of attacks on cities in Ukraine in 1945. The UPA's goal was to disrupt the Soviet war effort and to promote Ukrainian independence.\n\n# Post-war period\n\n## Contacts with the special services of the West\n\nAfter the war, the UPA maintained contacts with the special services of the West, including the CIA and MI6. The UPA's goal was to promote Ukrainian independence and to disrupt the Soviet war effort.\n\n## Final suppression of the insurgency\n\nIn the late 1940s, the Soviet Union finally suppressed the UPA insurgency. The UPA's leaders were arrested and imprisoned, and the organization was forced to go underground. The UPA's final suppression marked the end of the Ukrainian nationalist movement's armed resistance against the Soviet Union.\n\n# See also\n\n* Ukrainian Insurgent Army\n* Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists\n* Stepan Bandera\n* Roman Shukhevych\n* World War II\n* Soviet Union\n* Ukraine\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is based on a variety of sources, including books, articles, and primary documents.\n\n# References\n\nThis article does not include references.\n\n# Further reading\n\n* Armstrong, John A.

The plot was uncovered in December 2022, leading to a series of arrests and investigations.\n\n# Members\n\nThe group behind the plot consisted of approximately 50 individuals, including former military personnel, police officers, and far-right activists. The alleged ringleader of the group was Heinrich XIII, Prince of Reuss, a 71-year-old businessman and member of the House of Reuss. Other notable members included Rüdiger von Pescatore, a former paratrooper and Birgit Malsack-Winkemann, a former member of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.\n\nThe group was known to have ties to various far-right organizations and networks, including the Reichsbürger movement, which rejects the legitimacy of the German government and advocates for the restoration of the German Reich. Some members of the group were also linked to the QAnon conspiracy theory.\n\n# Ideology and aims\n\nThe group's ideology was rooted in far-right extremism, with a strong anti-government and anti-democratic stance. They believed that the German government was illegitimate and that the country was being controlled by a cabal of corrupt politicians and bureaucrats.\n\nTheir ultimate goal was to overthrow the government and establish a new authoritarian regime, with Heinrich XIII, Prince of Reuss, as the leader. The group planned to use violence and intimidation to achieve their aims, including the assassination of politicians and the takeover of key government buildings.\n\n# Investigations and arrests\n\nThe plot was uncovered in December 2022, after a tip-off from a confidential informant. The Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) launched an investigation, which led to the arrest of 25 individuals, including Heinrich XIII, Prince of Reuss, and Rüdiger von Pescatore.\n\nThe arrests were carried out in a coordinated operation across several states, with police raiding homes and offices to gather evidence. The suspects were charged with treason, sedition, and other serious crimes.\n\nThe investigation is ongoing, with authorities working to uncover the full extent of the plot and identify any other individuals involved.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## Domestic\n\nThe news of the plot sparked widespread shock and outrage in Germany, with politicians and citizens condemning the attempted coup.\n\nThe German government praised the police and intelligence agencies for their swift action in foiling the plot. Chancellor Olaf Scholz vowed to take all necessary measures to protect democracy and the rule of law.\n\nThe opposition parties also condemned the plot, with the AfD party distancing itself from the group and its ideology.\n\n## International\n\nThe international community has expressed concern over the plot, with several countries condemning the attempted coup.\n\nThe European Union has offered its support to the German government, with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen praising the authorities for their swift action.\n\nThe United States has also condemned the plot, with the State Department expressing its support for the German government and the rule of law.\n\n# See also\n\n* Reichsbürger movement\n* QAnon conspiracy theory\n* Alternative for Germany (AfD) party\n* German far-right extremism\n* Coup d'état attempts in Germany", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_German_coup_d'état_plot\" following this outline:\n\n#Members\n#Ideology and aims\n#Investigations and arrests\n#Reactions\n##Domestic\n##International\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Lakota religion is a multifaceted and dynamic system of beliefs, practices, and rituals that have evolved over centuries, shaped by the tribe's experiences, mythology, and interactions with other cultures. This article provides an overview of the key aspects of Lakota religion, including its definition and classification, beliefs, practices, history, demographics, and reception and influence.\n\n# Definition and classification\n\nLakota religion is a form of indigenous spirituality that belongs to the broader category of Native American religions. It is a distinct tradition that has developed among the Lakota people, who are a confederation of seven related tribes: the Oglala, Brule, Hunkpapa, Miniconjou, Sans Arc, Sisseton, and Oohenunpa. Lakota religion is often classified as a form of animism, as it recognizes the presence of spirits and supernatural powers in the natural world.\n\n# Beliefs\n\n## Wakʽą and Wakʽą Tʽąką\n\nAt the heart of Lakota religion is the concept of Wakʽą, which refers to the sacred or mysterious powers that permeate the universe. Wakʽą is often translated as \"sacred\" or \"mysterious,\" but it carries a deeper meaning that encompasses the spiritual, mystical, and supernatural aspects of reality. Wakʽą Tʽąką, or the \"sacred hoop,\" is a symbol of the interconnectedness of all things and the cyclical nature of life.\n\n## Wakʽąpi\n\nWakʽąpi are the spirits that inhabit the natural world, including animals, plants, rocks, and elements. These spirits are believed to possess Wakʽą and are often associated with specific powers, abilities, or characteristics. Wakʽąpi are revered and respected, and the Lakota people believe that they can communicate with them through rituals, offerings, and prayer.\n\n## Cosmogony\n\nLakota cosmogony is rooted in the creation story, which tells of the emergence of the world from the primordial waters. The creation story describes the formation of the earth, the sun, the moon, and the stars, as well as the creation of animals and humans. The story emphasizes the importance of balance, harmony, and reciprocity in the natural world.\n\n## Spirit and afterlife\n\nLakota people believe in a complex afterlife, where the spirit continues to exist after physical death. The spirit is believed to journey to the afterlife, where it is judged by the spirits of the ancestors. The afterlife is seen as a place of continued growth, learning, and spiritual evolution.\n\n## Animism and kinship\n\nLakota people believe in a profound connection with the natural world, which is reflected in their animistic worldview. This connection is based on a deep sense of kinship with all living beings, which are seen as relatives and friends. The Lakota people believe that humans are part of the natural world, not separate from it, and that their actions have consequences for the entire web of life.\n\n### Šicųpi and wašicu\n\nŠicųpi, or \"friend,\" is a term used to describe the close relationships between humans and non-human entities, such as animals or spirits. Wašicu, or \"taker,\" refers to the exploitative and destructive relationships that humans can have with the natural world. The Lakota people strive to maintain a balance between these two modes of relationship, recognizing the importance of reciprocity and respect in their interactions with the natural world.\n\n## Cosmology and the sacred hoop\n\nLakota cosmology is based on the concept of the sacred hoop, which represents the interconnectedness of all things. The hoop is seen as a symbol of the cyclical nature of life, where birth, growth, decay, and renewal are interconnected. The sacred hoop is also seen as a symbol of the balance and harmony that exist in the natural world.\n\n## Morality and gender roles\n\nLakota morality is based on a deep sense of respect, reciprocity, and responsibility towards all living beings. The Lakota people believe in a strong sense of community and shared responsibility, where individuals are expected to contribute to the well-being of the community. Gender roles are not rigidly defined, and individuals are free to choose their own roles and responsibilities.\n\n# Practices\n\n## Prayer and offerings\n\nPrayer and offerings are central to Lakota spirituality, as they provide a means of communicating with the spirits and expressing gratitude and respect. Prayers are often recited in a ritual context, accompanied by offerings of food, tobacco, or other sacred substances.\n\n### Suffering and sacrifice\n\nSuffering and sacrifice are seen as important aspects of spiritual growth and development. The Lakota people believe that individuals must be willing to suffer and sacrifice in order to achieve spiritual power and wisdom.\n\n## The sacred pipe\n\nThe sacred pipe is a central symbol of Lakota spirituality, representing the connection between the physical and spiritual worlds. The pipe is used in rituals and ceremonies to communicate with the spirits and to seal agreements and covenants.\n\n## Sweat lodge\n\nThe sweat lodge is a sacred structure used for purification and spiritual growth. Participants enter the lodge to pray, sing, and seek spiritual guidance, and to purify their bodies and minds.\n\n## Vision quest\n\nThe vision quest is a rite of passage that marks an individual's transition from childhood to adulthood. The individual seeks a vision from the spirits, which provides guidance and direction for their future.\n\n## Sun dance\n\nThe sun dance is a major ceremony that takes place during the summer solstice. The ceremony involves singing, dancing, and offerings to the spirits, and is seen as a way of renewing the balance and harmony of the natural world.\n\n## Further rites\n\nThere are many other rites and ceremonies that are part of Lakota spirituality, including the giveaway ceremony, the naming ceremony, and the funerary rites.\n\n## Healing and cursing\n\nThe Lakota people believe in the power of healing and cursing, which are seen as aspects of spiritual power and wisdom. Healers use their knowledge and skills to cure illnesses and injuries, while cursers use their power to harm or destroy.\n\n## Holy men\n\nHoly men, or spiritual leaders, play an important role in Lakota spirituality. They provide guidance, wisdom, and spiritual direction, and are often called upon to perform rituals and ceremonies.\n\n### Yuwípi and yuwípi wičháša\n\nYuwípi are spiritual leaders who have achieved a high level of spiritual power and wisdom. Yuwípi wičháša are spiritual leaders who have achieved a high level of spiritual power and wisdom, and are recognized as experts in the spiritual traditions of the Lakota people.\n\n### Other specialists\n\nThere are many other specialists who play important roles in Lakota spirituality, including healers, singers, and storytellers.\n\n# History\n\n## Prehistory\n\nThe Lakota people have a rich and complex history that stretches back thousands of years. The earliest inhabitants of the region were hunter-gatherers, who lived in small bands and followed the game.\n\n## Encounters with Christianity and colonialism\n\nThe arrival of European colonizers and Christian missionaries had a profound impact on Lakota spirituality. Many Lakota people converted to Christianity, while others maintained their traditional spiritual practices.\n\n## Revivalism\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, there was a revival of interest in traditional Lakota spirituality. This revival was led by spiritual leaders who sought to preserve and promote the traditional spiritual practices of the Lakota people.\n\n# Demographics\n\nThe Lakota people are a significant population in the United States and Canada.

He has gained notoriety in recent years due to his involvement in far-right politics and conspiracy theories, as well as his alleged involvement in a plot to overthrow the German government.\n\n# Biography\n\n## Personal life and ancestry\n\nHeinrich XIII, Prinz Reuss was born on December 4, 1951, in Gera, East Germany. He is a member of the House of Reuss, a noble family that has played a significant role in German history. The Reuss family ruled over the German states of Reuss-Gera and Reuss-Greiz from the 13th to the 20th century. Heinrich XIII is a descendant of Heinrich XXVII, the last reigning prince of Reuss-Gera, who died in 1928.\n\nHeinrich XIII studied business administration and economics at the University of Göttingen, where he earned a degree in 1976. After completing his studies, he worked in various industries, including finance and real estate.\n\n## Business and family activities\n\nHeinrich XIII has been involved in various business ventures over the years, including real estate development and financial services. He has also been involved in the management of the family's assets, which include several castles and estates in eastern Germany.\n\nIn addition to his business activities, Heinrich XIII is also involved in various cultural and historical organizations. He is a member of the German Nobles' Association and has served as the president of the Reuss Family Association.\n\n## Views and conspiracy theories\n\nHeinrich XIII has expressed far-right and anti-Semitic views on several occasions. He has been known to promote conspiracy theories about the German government and the European Union, and has expressed skepticism about the official narrative of World War II.\n\nIn 2019, Heinrich XIII sparked controversy when he referred to the German government as a \"puppet regime\" and claimed that the country was being controlled by a \"deep state\" of bureaucrats and politicians. He has also expressed support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which has been accused of promoting xenophobic and anti-Semitic views.\n\n## Assault on journalist Peter Hagen\n\nIn 2020, Heinrich XIII was involved in a scandal when he assaulted a journalist who was investigating his business dealings. Peter Hagen, a reporter for the German newspaper Die Zeit, was researching a story about Heinrich XIII's involvement in a real estate development project when he was confronted by the prince.\n\nAccording to Hagen, Heinrich XIII became aggressive and physically assaulted him, causing him to suffer minor injuries. The incident was widely reported in the German media and sparked outrage among journalists and human rights groups.\n\n## Involvement in 2022 German coup plot\n\nIn 2022, Heinrich XIII was accused of being involved in a plot to overthrow the German government. The plot, which was allegedly led by a group of far-right extremists, aimed to establish a new government that would be loyal to the German people rather than the European Union.\n\nHeinrich XIII was reportedly involved in the plot as a key financier and strategist. He was accused of providing funding and logistical support to the plotters, and of using his connections with far-right groups to help recruit new members.\n\nThe plot was foiled by German authorities in December 2022, and several people were arrested and charged with treason. Heinrich XIII was not among those arrested, but he was reportedly questioned by police and his assets were frozen as part of the investigation.\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is based on publicly available information and has not been verified through official sources.\n\n# References\n\nThis article does not include any references or citations.\n\n# External links\n\nThis article does not include any external links.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Heinrich_XIII_Prinz_Reuss\" following this outline:\n\n#Biography\n##Personal life and ancestry\n##Business and family activities\n##Views and conspiracy theories\n##Assault on journalist Peter Hagen\n##Involvement in 2022 German coup plot\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Sun_Belt", "content": "#Migration\n#Definition\n#Projections\n#Politics\n#Environment\n#Major cities\n#See also\n#References\n#Further reading\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Sun Belt\n\nThe Sun Belt is a region in the United States that has experienced significant population growth and economic development since the mid-20th century. Stretching across the southern and southwestern parts of the country, the Sun Belt has become a major driver of the US economy and a hub for various industries, including technology, healthcare, and tourism.\n\n# Migration\n\nThe Sun Belt's growth can be attributed, in part, to the large-scale migration of people from other parts of the country. Many Americans were drawn to the region's warm climate, affordable cost of living, and abundant job opportunities. This migration pattern, which began in the post-World War II era, has continued to shape the demographics and economy of the Sun Belt.\n\n## Domestic Migration\n\nBetween 1950 and 1990, the Sun Belt states experienced a significant influx of migrants from other parts of the country. Many of these migrants came from the Northeast and Midwest, where industries such as manufacturing were declining. The Sun Belt's growing economy, driven by industries like technology and healthcare, offered new opportunities for employment and economic advancement.\n\n## International Migration\n\nIn addition to domestic migration, the Sun Belt has also experienced significant international migration. Many immigrants have been drawn to the region's urban centers, such as Miami, Los Angeles, and Houston, which offer a range of economic and cultural opportunities. The Sun Belt is home to some of the largest Hispanic and Latino populations in the country, with many immigrants coming from countries like Mexico, Cuba, and Puerto Rico.\n\n# Definition\n\nThe Sun Belt is a broad geographic region that encompasses parts of the southern and southwestern United States. While there is no universally accepted definition of the Sun Belt, it is generally considered to include the states of Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Utah.\n\n## Regional Subdivisions\n\nThe Sun Belt can be further subdivided into several regions, each with its own unique cultural and economic characteristics.

According to the US Census Bureau, the Sun Belt states are expected to account for a disproportionate share of the country's population growth between 2020 and 2030.\n\n## Population Growth\n\nThe Sun Belt's population is projected to grow from approximately 140 million in 2020 to over 170 million by 2030. This growth will be driven by a combination of natural increase (births minus deaths) and migration. Many of the Sun Belt states are expected to experience significant population increases, with Texas, Florida, and California leading the way.\n\n## Economic Growth\n\nThe Sun Belt's economy is also expected to continue growing, driven by industries like technology, healthcare, and tourism. The region is home to many of the country's leading technology hubs, including Silicon Valley in California and the Research Triangle in North Carolina. The Sun Belt is also a major center for international trade, with many of its ports and airports serving as critical gateways for global commerce.\n\n# Politics\n\nThe Sun Belt has played an increasingly important role in US politics in recent decades. Many of the region's states are considered swing states, and the Sun Belt has been a key battleground in presidential elections.\n\n## Electoral Politics\n\nThe Sun Belt states have a significant number of electoral votes, making the region a critical component of any presidential campaign. In recent elections, the Sun Belt has been a key battleground, with candidates from both parties competing for votes in states like Florida, Texas, and North Carolina.\n\n## Policy Issues\n\nThe Sun Belt is home to a diverse range of policy issues, reflecting the region's unique cultural and economic characteristics. Some of the key policy issues in the Sun Belt include:\n\n* Immigration reform: The Sun Belt is home to many immigrants, and the region has been at the forefront of the debate over immigration reform.\n* Healthcare: The Sun Belt has been a leader in the development of the healthcare industry, and the region is home to many of the country's top hospitals and medical research centers.\n* Education: The Sun Belt is home to many of the country's top universities, and the region has been a leader in education reform efforts.\n\n# Environment\n\nThe Sun Belt is characterized by a diverse range of environmental ecosystems, including deserts, forests, and coastal regions. The region is also home to many of the country's most significant environmental challenges, including climate change, air and water pollution, and habitat destruction.\n\n## Climate Change\n\nThe Sun Belt is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, including rising temperatures, drought, and extreme weather events. Many of the region's cities are also experiencing significant air and water pollution, which can have serious health impacts for residents.\n\n## Conservation Efforts\n\nThe Sun Belt is home to many conservation efforts, aimed at protecting the region's natural ecosystems and promoting sustainable development. Some of the key conservation efforts in the Sun Belt include:\n\n* The creation of national parks and wildlife refuges: The Sun Belt is home to many of the country's most iconic national parks, including the Grand Canyon and Yellowstone.\n* The protection of endangered species: The Sun Belt is home to many endangered species, including the Florida panther and the California condor.\n\n# Major cities\n\nThe Sun Belt is home to many of the country's largest and most vibrant cities.

From bank robbers and motorcycle clubs to street gangs and crime syndicates, London has been a hub for organized crime in Canada. This article provides an overview of the history of organized crime in London, major events, and notable groups and individuals involved.\n\n# Overview\n\nLondon, Ontario, is a city with a population of approximately 400,000 people, located in southwestern Ontario. The city's strategic location, with access to major highways and the Canada-US border, has made it an attractive location for organized crime groups. London's organized crime scene is diverse, with various groups involved in activities such as extortion, narcotics trafficking, and violent crime.\n\n# Early History\n\n## Bank Robbers\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, London was a popular target for bank robbers. The city's banks were often targeted by notorious robbers, including the infamous Jesse James gang. One notable bank robbery occurred in 1882, when a group of robbers stole $10,000 from the Bank of Toronto.\n\n## Motorcycle Clubs\n\nMotorcycle clubs have a long history in London, dating back to the 1920s. The first motorcycle club in London was the London Motorcycle Club, which was established in 1920. However, it was not until the 1960s and 1970s that motorcycle clubs began to be associated with organized crime. The most notable motorcycle club in London during this period was the Satan's Choice Motorcycle Club, which was established in 1965.\n\n# Major Events\n\n## History of the London Klan\n\nThe Ku Klux Klan (KKK) has a history in London dating back to the 1920s. The London chapter of the KKK was established in 1925 and was known for its white supremacist and anti-Semitic views. The KKK was involved in various violent incidents in London, including the bombing of a synagogue in 1965.\n\n## Ontario Biker War\n\nThe Ontario Biker War was a violent conflict between motorcycle clubs in Ontario that lasted from 1977 to 1984. The conflict involved several motorcycle clubs, including the Satan's Choice, the Outlaws, and the Hells Angels. The war resulted in numerous violent incidents, including bombings, shootings, and stabbings.\n\n## London Conflict\n\nThe London Conflict was a violent conflict between the Hells Angels and the Outlaws motorcycle clubs that took place in London in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

The election was the seventh since the establishment of the Assembly in 1998.\n\n# Background\n\n## Electoral events\n\nThe election was held under the single transferable vote (STV) system, with 18 constituencies each electing five members. The Assembly's term was due to expire on 27 March 2023, but the election was called early due to a political crisis. The previous Assembly election was held in 2017, but the Assembly was suspended for three years due to a dispute between the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn Féin over issues such as same-sex marriage and the Irish language.\n\n## Leadership changes\n\nIn the period leading up to the election, there were significant leadership changes within the main parties. In April 2021, Edwin Poots was elected as the new leader of the DUP, succeeding Arlene Foster. However, Poots resigned as leader after just 21 days, and was succeeded by Jeffrey Donaldson. In November 2021, Mary Lou McDonald announced that she would be stepping down as leader of Sinn Féin in Northern Ireland, and was succeeded by Michelle O'Neill.\n\n## Northern Ireland Protocol\n\nThe Northern Ireland Protocol, which is part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement, was a major issue in the election campaign. The protocol created a customs border in the Irish Sea, which was opposed by unionist parties. The DUP and other unionist parties argued that the protocol undermined the Good Friday Agreement and threatened the Union.\n\n## Calls for early election\n\nIn February 2022, the DUP withdrew its First Minister from the Northern Ireland Executive, citing opposition to the Northern Ireland Protocol. This move triggered a crisis, and there were calls for an early election. On 28 February, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Brandon Lewis, announced that an election would be held on 5 May.\n\n# Candidates\n\nA total of 239 candidates stood in the election, representing 17 parties. The main parties contesting the election were the DUP, Sinn Féin, the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), and the Alliance Party.\n\n# Members not seeking re-election\n\nSeveral high-profile members of the Assembly did not seek re-election, including former DUP leader Arlene Foster, former UUP leader Robin Swann, and former SDLP leader Colum Eastwood.\n\n# Campaign\n\nThe election campaign focused on issues such as the Northern Ireland Protocol, the economy, and healthcare. The DUP and other unionist parties campaigned on a platform of opposition to the protocol, while Sinn Féin and other nationalist parties argued that the protocol was necessary to protect the Good Friday Agreement.\n\n# Opinion polls\n\nOpinion polls suggested that Sinn Féin would emerge as the largest party in the Assembly, with the DUP and Alliance Party also performing well. The polls also suggested that the UUP and SDLP would lose seats.\n\n# Results\n\n## Distribution of seats by constituency\n\nThe results of the election were as follows:\n\n* Belfast East: DUP 2, Alliance 2, UUP 1\n* Belfast North: DUP 2, Sinn Féin 2, SDLP 1\n* Belfast South: DUP 1, Sinn Féin 1, SDLP 1, Alliance 1, Green 1\n* Belfast West: Sinn Féin 4, SDLP 1\n* East Antrim: DUP 2, Alliance 2, UUP 1\n* East Londonderry: DUP 2, Sinn Féin 2, SDLP 1\n* Fermanagh and South Tyrone: Sinn Féin 3, DUP 1, UUP 1\n* Foyle: Sinn Féin 2, SDLP 2, DUP 1\n* Lagan Valley: DUP 2, UUP 2, Alliance 1\n* Mid Ulster: Sinn Féin 3, DUP 1, SDLP 1\n* Newry and Armagh: Sinn Féin 3, DUP 1, SDLP 1\n* North Antrim: DUP 2, TUV 1, Alliance 1, UUP 1\n* North Down: DUP 1, Alliance 2, UUP 1, Green 1\n* South Antrim: DUP 2, UUP 1, Alliance 1, SDLP 1\n* South Down: Sinn Féin 2, SDLP 2, DUP 1\n* Strangford: DUP 2, UUP 1, Alliance 1, SDLP 1\n* Upper Bann: DUP 2, UUP 1, Sinn Féin 1, SDLP 1\n* West Tyrone: Sinn Féin 3, DUP 1, SDLP 1\n\n## Share of first-preference votes\n\nThe share of first-preference votes was as follows:\n\n* Sinn Féin: 29.0%\n* DUP: 21.3%\n* Alliance: 13.5%\n* UUP: 11.2%\n* SDLP: 9.1%\n* TUV: 2.6%\n* Green: 1.9%\n* People Before Profit: 1.4%\n* Aontú: 1.1%\n* Others: 3.8%\n\n## Incumbents defeated\n\nSeveral high-profile incumbents lost their seats in the election, including DUP MLA Christopher Stalford, UUP MLA Andy Allen, and SDLP MLA Colin McGrath.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe election resulted in a significant shift in the balance of power in the Assembly, with Sinn Féin emerging as the largest party. The DUP and Alliance Party also performed well, while the UUP and SDLP lost seats. The results were seen as a significant blow to the DUP, which had been the largest party in the Assembly since 2003.\n\n# See also\n\n* 2017 Northern Ireland Assembly election\n* Northern Ireland Protocol\n* Good Friday Agreement\n* Brexit and the Irish border\n\n# Footnotes\n\n# References\n\n# External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Northern_Ireland_Assembly_election\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Electoral events\n##Leadership changes\n##Northern Ireland Protocol\n##Calls for early election\n#Candidates\n#Members not seeking re-election\n#Campaign\n#Opinion polls\n#Results\n##Distribution of seats by constituency\n##Share of first-preference votes\n##Incumbents defeated\n#Aftermath\n#See also\n#Footnotes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

These storms can bring catastrophic winds, rainfall, and storm surges that can affect millions of people worldwide. The year 2022 saw a significant number of tropical cyclones form across the globe, resulting in loss of life and property damage. This article provides an overview of the global atmospheric and hydrological conditions, a summary of the tropical cyclones that occurred in each basin, and a detailed list of the systems that formed during the year.\n\n# Global atmospheric and hydrological conditions\n\nThe global atmospheric and hydrological conditions in 2022 were influenced by several climate patterns, including the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), and the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO). These patterns can impact the formation and trajectory of tropical cyclones. The ENSO cycle was in a neutral phase during the first half of the year, but transitioned to a weak El Niño event in the second half. The IOD was also in a neutral phase for most of the year, but a positive phase developed in the latter part of the year. The MJO was active throughout the year, with several events occurring in the tropics.\n\n# Summary\n\n## North Atlantic Ocean\n\nThe North Atlantic hurricane season was near average in terms of activity, with 14 named storms, 8 hurricanes, and 2 major hurricanes.

He was best known as a member of the hip-hop trio Migos, alongside Quavo and Offset. Born on June 18, 1994, in Lawrenceville, Georgia, Takeoff's life was marked by a rapid rise to fame, followed by a tragic and untimely death.\n\n#Early life\n\nTakeoff was born to a family of modest means in Lawrenceville, Georgia. His parents, Edna Marshall and Kenneth Ball, raised him and his two siblings in a low-income household. Takeoff's early life was marked by a love for music, particularly hip-hop, which he developed at a young age. He attended Berkmar High School in Lilburn, Georgia, where he met his future Migos group members, Quavo and Offset. The three began rapping together in their teenage years, eventually forming Migos.\n\n#Career\n\n##2008–2018: Early work with Migos\n\nTakeoff's music career began in 2008, when he, Quavo, and Offset formed Migos. The group gained a local following in Atlanta, releasing their debut mixtape, \"Juug Season,\" in 2011. However, it was their 2013 single \"Versace\" that brought them widespread attention, with the song's catchy hook and infectious beat making it a viral hit.\n\nMigos released their debut studio album, \"Yung Rich Nation,\" in 2015, which featured the hit single \"One Time.\" The album received generally positive reviews from critics and helped establish Migos as a rising force in hip-hop. Takeoff's contributions to the album were notable, with his unique vocal style and lyrical ability setting him apart from his group members.\n\nOver the next few years, Migos released a string of successful albums and singles, including \"Culture\" (2017), \"Bad and Boujee\" (2016), and \"Stir Fry\" (2017). Takeoff's role in the group continued to grow, with him becoming an integral part of Migos' sound and image.\n\n##2018–2021: The Last Rocket and later Migos work\n\nIn 2018, Takeoff released his debut solo album, \"The Last Rocket.\" The album was a commercial success, debuting at number four on the US Billboard 200 chart and featuring the hit single \"Last Memory.\" The album received positive reviews from critics, with many praising Takeoff's lyrical ability and unique vocal style.\n\nFollowing the release of \"The Last Rocket,\" Takeoff continued to work with Migos, releasing the album \"Culture II\" in 2018. The album was a commercial success, debuting at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart and featuring the hit singles \"Stir Fry\" and \"Walk It Talk It.\"\n\nIn 2021, Migos released their fourth studio album, \"Culture III.\" The album was a commercial success, debuting at number two on the US Billboard 200 chart and featuring the hit singles \"Need It\" and \"Type Shit.\"\n\n##2022: Friction within Migos and Only Built for Infinity Links\n\nIn 2022, Takeoff and Quavo began to pursue solo projects, with the two releasing the collaborative album \"Only Built for Infinity Links\" in October 2022. The album was a commercial success, debuting at number seven on the US Billboard 200 chart and featuring the hit single \"Hotel Lobby.\"\n\nHowever, the release of \"Only Built for Infinity Links\" was also marked by friction within Migos. In an interview with The Rap Yearbook, Quavo and Takeoff seemed to hint at a rift within the group, with the two stating that they were \"not on the same page\" as Offset.\n\n#Legal issues\n\n##Georgia Southern University incident\n\nIn 2015, Takeoff and Migos were involved in a controversy at Georgia Southern University. The group had been booked to perform at the university's Spring Bling concert, but the show was cut short after a shooting occurred backstage. Takeoff and Migos were subsequently banned from performing at the university.\n\n##Sexual assault allegations\n\nIn 2018, Takeoff was accused of sexual assault by a woman who claimed that he had assaulted her at a party in Los Angeles. Takeoff denied the allegations, stating that they were \"false and baseless.\" The incident was widely reported in the media, with many outlets calling for Takeoff to be dropped by his record label.\n\n#Murder and trial\n\nOn November 1, 2022, Takeoff was shot and killed outside a bowling alley in Houston, Texas. He was 28 years old at the time of his death. The shooting occurred at around 2:30am, with Takeoff and Quavo having been attending a private party at the bowling alley.\n\n##Reactions\n\nTakeoff's death was met with widespread shock and sadness in the music industry, with many artists and celebrities paying tribute to him on social media. Quavo, who was present at the scene of the shooting, was particularly devastated by Takeoff's death, with the two having been close friends and collaborators for many years.\n\n##Investigation and legal proceedings\n\nThe investigation into Takeoff's death is ongoing, with the Houston Police Department working to identify the suspect and motive behind the shooting. In December 2022, a 33-year-old man named Patrick Xavier Clark was arrested and charged with Takeoff's murder.\n\n##Funeral\n\nTakeoff's funeral was held on November 11, 2022, at the State Farm Arena in Atlanta, Georgia. The funeral was attended by many of Takeoff's friends and family, including Quavo and Offset. The service was also live-streamed on YouTube, with many fans and well-wishers paying their respects to Takeoff.\n\n##Commercial impact\n\nTakeoff's death had a significant commercial impact, with his music experiencing a surge in popularity following his passing. His solo album \"The Last Rocket\" re-entered the US Billboard 200 chart, while Migos' albums \"Culture\" and \"Culture II\" also saw a significant increase in sales.\n\n#Discography\n\n* The Last Rocket (2018)\n* Only Built for Infinity Links (with Quavo) (2022)\n\nAs a member of Migos:\n\n* Yung Rich Nation (2015)\n* Culture (2017)\n* Culture II (2018)\n* Culture III (2021)\n\n#See also\n\n* Migos\n* Quavo\n* Offset\n\n#Notes\n\n* Takeoff's real name was Kirshnik Khari Ball.\n* He was born on June 18, 1994, in Lawrenceville, Georgia.\n* Takeoff was a member of the hip-hop trio Migos, alongside Quavo and Offset.\n* He released his debut solo album \"The Last Rocket\" in 2018.\n\n#References\n\n* None cited.\n\n#External links\n\n* Takeoff on Instagram\n* Takeoff on Twitter\n* Takeoff on YouTube", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Takeoff_(rapper)\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n#Career\n##2008–2018: Early work with Migos\n##2018–2021: The Last Rocket and later Migos work\n##2022: Friction within Migos and Only Built for Infinity Links\n#Legal issues\n##Georgia Southern University incident\n##Sexual assault allegations\n#Murder and trial\n##Reactions\n##Investigation and legal proceedings\n##Funeral\n##Commercial impact\n#Discography\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is one of the most common surgical procedures performed worldwide, with millions of operations taking place every year. The goal of cataract surgery is to improve vision by replacing the cloudy lens with an artificial one, known as an intraocular lens (IOL).\n\n# Uses\n\nCataract surgery is primarily used to treat cataracts that are causing significant visual impairment. The procedure is usually recommended for individuals who experience one or more of the following symptoms:\n\n* Blurred or cloudy vision\n* Double vision\n* Sensitivity to light\n* Difficulty reading or watching television\n* Difficulty driving or performing daily activities\n\nCataract surgery is also used to treat other conditions, such as congenital cataracts, which are present at birth, and secondary cataracts, which can develop as a result of other eye conditions or injuries.\n\n# Techniques\n\nThere are several techniques used in cataract surgery, including:\n\n## Phacoemulsification\n\nPhacoemulsification is the most common technique used in cataract surgery. It involves the use of ultrasonic waves to break up the cataract, which is then suctioned out of the eye through a small incision. This technique is minimally invasive and allows for quick recovery.\n\n## Manual Small Incision Cataract Surgery (MSICS)\n\nMSICS is a technique that involves making a small incision in the eye and manually removing the cataract. This technique is often used in cases where phacoemulsification is not possible.\n\n## Extracapsular Cataract Extraction (ECCE)\n\nECCE is a technique that involves making a larger incision in the eye and removing the cataract in one piece. This technique is often used in cases where the cataract is very large or where other complications are present.\n\n# Pre-operative Evaluation\n\nBefore undergoing cataract surgery, patients undergo a comprehensive pre-operative evaluation to determine the best course of treatment.\n\n## Contraindications\n\nThere are several contraindications for cataract surgery, including:\n\n* Active eye infections\n* Uncontrolled diabetes\n* Uncontrolled hypertension\n* Bleeding disorders\n\n## Selection of Intraocular Lenses\n\nThe selection of an intraocular lens (IOL) is an important part of the pre-operative evaluation. IOLs come in different types, including monofocal, multifocal, and toric lenses. The type of IOL used depends on the individual's needs and preferences.\n\n# Operation Procedures\n\nThe operation procedure for cataract surgery typically involves the following steps:\n\n## Preparation\n\nThe patient is prepared for surgery by administering local anesthesia and positioning the patient under the microscope.\n\n## Anaesthesia\n\nLocal anesthesia is used to numb the eye and prevent pain during the procedure.\n\n## Phacoemulsification\n\nThe phacoemulsification procedure involves making a small incision in the eye and inserting a phacoemulsification probe. The probe uses ultrasonic waves to break up the cataract, which is then suctioned out of the eye.\n\n## Manual Small Incision Cataract Surgery (MSICS)\n\nThe MSICS procedure involves making a small incision in the eye and manually removing the cataract.\n\n## Extracapsular Cataract Extraction (ECCE)\n\nThe ECCE procedure involves making a larger incision in the eye and removing the cataract in one piece.\n\n## Converting to ECCE to Manage a Contingency\n\nIn some cases, it may be necessary to convert to ECCE to manage a contingency, such as a complication during the procedure.\n\n## Closing the Wound\n\nThe wound is closed with sutures or a sealant, depending on the type of procedure used.\n\n# Post-operative Care\n\nAfter the procedure, patients receive post-operative care to ensure a smooth recovery.\n\n# Complications\n\nAs with any surgical procedure, there are potential complications associated with cataract surgery.\n\n## During Surgery\n\nComplications that can occur during surgery include:\n\n* Retinal detachment\n* Cataract rupture\n* Infection\n\n## After Surgery\n\nComplications that can occur after surgery include:\n\n* Infection\n* Inflammation\n* Dry eye\n\n## Risk\n\nThe risk of complications depends on several factors, including the type of procedure used, the patient's overall health, and the surgeon's experience.\n\n# Recovery and Rehabilitation\n\nThe recovery and rehabilitation process for cataract surgery typically involves the following steps:\n\n* Resting the eye for a few days\n* Using eye drops to help the eye heal\n* Wearing protective glasses to protect the eye\n* Following up with the surgeon to ensure a smooth recovery\n\n# Outcomes\n\nThe outcomes for cataract surgery are generally excellent, with most patients experiencing significant improvement in their vision.\n\n# History\n\nCataract surgery has a long history, dating back to ancient times. The first recorded cataract surgery was performed in ancient India in the 6th century BC.\n\n# Accessibility\n\nCataract surgery is widely available in many parts of the world.\n\n## Europe\n\nIn Europe, cataract surgery is widely available and is one of the most common surgical procedures performed.\n\n## Asia\n\nIn Asia, cataract surgery is also widely available, with many countries offering high-quality care.\n\n## Africa\n\nIn Africa, access to cataract surgery is limited in some areas, but many countries are working to improve access to care.\n\n## Latin America\n\nIn Latin America, cataract surgery is widely available, with many countries offering high-quality care.\n\n# Social, Economic, and Environmental Relevance\n\nCataract surgery has significant social, economic, and environmental relevance.\n\n# Special Populations\n\nCataract surgery is also used to treat special populations, including:\n\n## Congenital Cataracts\n\nCongenital cataracts are cataracts that are present at birth. Cataract surgery is often used to treat congenital cataracts.\n\n## Higher Risk for Operations on Separate Occasions\n\nIn some cases, patients may be at higher risk for complications if they undergo cataract surgery on separate occasions.\n\n# Other Animals\n\nCataract surgery is also used to treat cataracts in other animals, including dogs and cats.\n\n# See Also\n\n* Cataract\n* Intraocular lens\n* Phacoemulsification\n* Manual small incision cataract surgery\n* Extracapsular cataract extraction\n\n# Notes\n\n* This article is a general overview of cataract surgery and is not intended to be a comprehensive guide.\n* Patients should consult with a qualified healthcare professional to determine the best course of treatment for their individual needs.\n\n# References\n\n* None\n\n# Further Reading\n\n* None\n\n# External Links\n\n* None", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Cataract_surgery\" following this outline:\n\n#Uses\n#Techniques\n#Pre-operative evaluation\n##Contraindications\n##Selection of intraocular lenses\n#Operation procedures\n##Preparation\n##Anaesthesia\n##Phacoemulsification\n##Manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS)\n##Extracapsular cataract extraction\n##Converting to ECCE to manage a contingency\n##Closing the wound\n#Post-operative care\n#Complications\n##During surgery\n##After surgery\n##Risk\n#Recovery and rehabilitation\n#Outcomes\n#History\n#Accessibility\n##Europe\n##Asia\n##Africa\n##Latin America\n#Social, economic and environmental relevance\n#Special populations\n##Congenital cataracts\n##Higher risk for operations on separate occasions\n#Other animals\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

With a history spanning over 100 years, the company has established itself as a leading player in the construction industry, providing a range of services including building, civil engineering, and facilities management.\n\n# History\n\n## Main contractor\n\nThe Shepherd Building Group was founded in 1890 by a Yorkshire-based family. The company started as a small building contractor, undertaking local construction projects. Over the years, the company expanded its operations, taking on larger and more complex projects. In the mid-20th century, the company began to diversify its services, offering civil engineering and facilities management solutions to its clients.\n\n## Manufactured products\n\nIn the 1960s, the Shepherd Building Group began to manufacture its own building products, including prefabricated buildings and structural steelwork. This move allowed the company to exert greater control over the quality of its projects and to reduce its reliance on external suppliers. The company's manufacturing division has since expanded to produce a range of products, including roofing systems, cladding, and glazing.\n\n## Disposal of non-core businesses\n\nIn the 1990s and 2000s, the Shepherd Building Group underwent a period of significant change, disposing of several non-core businesses and focusing on its core construction and manufacturing activities. This process of consolidation allowed the company to streamline its operations, reduce costs, and improve its overall efficiency.\n\n# Notable construction projects\n\nThe Shepherd Building Group has been involved in a number of high-profile construction projects over the years, including the redevelopment of the London Olympic Park, the construction of the Leeds Arena, and the refurbishment of the historic York Minster. These projects demonstrate the company's ability to deliver complex and large-scale construction projects to a high standard.\n\n# Controversies\n\n## Identity behind anonymous emails\n\nIn 2012, the Shepherd Building Group was at the center of a controversy surrounding a series of anonymous emails sent to local residents and businesses in the town of Selby, North Yorkshire. The emails, which were highly critical of the company's plans to develop a new housing estate in the area, were found to have been sent from a computer linked to the Shepherd Building Group. The company denied any involvement in the emails, but the incident raised questions about the company's transparency and accountability.\n\n## Hand tool vibration\n\nIn 2015, the Shepherd Building Group was fined £100,000 by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) after one of its employees was found to have developed a debilitating condition caused by the prolonged use of vibrating hand tools. The incident highlighted the company's failure to properly manage the risks associated with hand tool vibration and to provide adequate training to its employees.\n\n## Domain name disputes\n\nIn 2018, the Shepherd Building Group was involved in a dispute with a rival construction company over the ownership of a domain name. The rival company had registered a domain name that was similar to the Shepherd Building Group's own website, and was using it to direct traffic to its own site. The Shepherd Building Group claimed that the rival company was engaging in \"cyber squatting\" and sought to have the domain name transferred to its own ownership.\n\n## Employment blacklisting\n\nIn 2019, the Shepherd Building Group was accused of being involved in a construction industry blacklisting scandal, in which companies were found to have been secretly sharing information about workers who had been involved in trade union activity or had raised health and safety concerns. The company denied any involvement in the scandal, but the incident raised questions about the company's commitment to fair labor practices.\n\n## Trinity Walk\n\nIn 2020, the Shepherd Building Group was involved in a controversy surrounding the redevelopment of the Trinity Walk shopping center in Wakefield, West Yorkshire. Local residents and businesses had raised concerns about the impact of the development on the local community, including the potential for increased traffic congestion and the loss of small businesses. The company was accused of failing to properly consult with local stakeholders and of prioritizing the interests of its own shareholders over those of the community.\n\n# See also\n\n* Construction industry\n* Building engineering\n* Facilities management\n* Civil engineering\n* Manufacturing\n* Prefabricated buildings\n* Structural steelwork\n* Health and safety\n* Employment law\n* Domain name disputes\n* Cyber squatting\n* Blacklisting\n* Trade unions\n* Labor rights", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Shepherd_Building_Group\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Main contractor\n##Manufactured products\n##Disposal of non core businesses\n#Notable construction projects\n#Controversies\n##Identity behind anonymous emails\n##Hand tool vibration\n##Domain name disputes\n##Employment blacklisting\n##Trinity Walk\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The global economic crisis of 1929 had a significant impact on France, leading to a decline in industrial production, rising unemployment, and increased poverty. The French government responded to the crisis by implementing a series of austerity measures, including price controls and rationing, which further exacerbated the economic situation.\n\n### Fall of France\n\nIn May 1940, Germany launched a surprise attack on France, which led to the country's rapid defeat and occupation. The fall of France had a profound impact on the country's economy, leading to widespread shortages, price increases, and a decline in living standards. The German occupation authorities imposed strict controls on the economy, including rationing, price controls, and censorship, which further restricted the availability of goods and services.\n\n1940-1941\n\n### Origins\n\nThe black market in wartime France emerged as a response to the shortages and restrictions imposed by the German occupation authorities. The black market was characterized by the illicit trade and exchange of goods and services, including food, clothing, and other essential items.\n\n#### Rationing and Price Controls\n\nThe German occupation authorities imposed strict rationing and price controls on the French economy, which led to widespread shortages and price increases. The rationing system was designed to ensure that essential goods were available to the population, but it was often ineffective and corrupt. The price controls, on the other hand, were designed to prevent price gouging, but they often had the opposite effect, leading to shortages and black market activity.\n\n#### Diversion from Official Channels\n\nThe black market emerged as a response to the diversion of goods from official channels. Many French businesses and individuals began to divert goods from the official market to the black market, where they could be sold at higher prices. This diversion of goods was often facilitated by corrupt government officials and businessmen.\n\n#### Clandestine Networks\n\nThe black market in wartime France was characterized by a network of clandestine relationships between buyers and sellers. These networks were often hidden from view, and they involved a range of individuals and organizations, including businessmen, farmers, and ordinary citizens.\n\n#### Hidden Stockpiling\n\nHidden stockpiling was a key feature of the black market in wartime France. Many individuals and businesses began to stockpile goods, including food and other essential items, in secret locations. These stockpiles were often hidden from view, and they were used to supply the black market.\n\n#### Grey Market\n\nThe grey market was a key feature of the black market in wartime France. The grey market referred to the trade in goods that were not strictly illegal but were not officially sanctioned either. The grey market was characterized by the trade in goods such as tobacco, coffee, and chocolate, which were not essential but were highly sought after.\n\n### Users of the Black Market\n\nThe black market in wartime France was used by a range of individuals and organizations, including ordinary citizens, businesses, and government officials.\n\n#### Privileged French\n\nThe privileged French, including businessmen, politicians, and high-ranking officials, were among the main users of the black market. These individuals often had access to goods and services that were not available to the general population, and they used the black market to acquire luxury items and other goods.\n\n#### Occupation Forces\n\nThe German occupation forces were also major users of the black market in wartime France. The occupation forces used the black market to acquire goods and services that were not available through official channels, including food, clothing, and other essential items.\n\n### Public Response\n\nThe public response to the black market in wartime France was complex and multifaceted.\n\n#### Early Condemnation\n\nThe black market was initially condemned by the French public, who saw it as a corrupt and immoral institution. Many French citizens were outraged by the prices and shortages that characterized the black market, and they called for strict measures to be taken against those who participated in it.\n\n#### Participation\n\nDespite the initial condemnation, many French citizens began to participate in the black market as the war dragged on. The black market offered a way for individuals to acquire goods and services that were not available through official channels, and many people saw it as a necessary evil.\n\n#### Housewives' Demonstrations\n\nHousewives' demonstrations were a key feature of the public response to the black market in wartime France. Many housewives, who were responsible for managing the household budget and acquiring goods and services, began to demonstrate against the high prices and shortages that characterized the black market.\n\n#### Suspicions of Hoarding\n\nMany French citizens suspected that the black market was controlled by hoarders and speculators who were profiteering from the shortages and price increases. These suspicions were often fueled by rumors and propaganda, and they contributed to the widespread resentment of the black market.\n\n#### Official Antisemitism\n\nThe French government and occupation authorities often blamed the black market on Jews and other minority groups. This official antisemitism was used to justify strict measures against the black market, including arrests, fines, and other penalties.\n\n#### Public Opinion\n\nPublic opinion on the black market in wartime France was complex and multifaceted. Many French citizens saw the black market as a necessary evil, while others condemned it as corrupt and immoral.\n\n#### Political Opposition\n\nThe black market was also opposed by many politicians and activists, who saw it as a symbol of the corruption and inefficiency of the French government and occupation authorities.\n\n### Response by Authorities\n\nThe response of the authorities to the black market in wartime France was complex and multifaceted.\n\nThe French government and occupation authorities implemented a range of measures to combat the black market, including arrests, fines, and other penalties. However, these measures were often ineffective, and the black market continued to thrive.\n\nWidespread Black Market (Autumn 1941 to 1943)\n\nThe black market in wartime France became widespread and entrenched during the autumn of 1941 and the spring of 1943.\n\n### Agricultural Black Market\n\nThe agricultural black market was a key feature of the widespread black market in wartime France. Many farmers began to sell their produce on the black market, where they could get higher prices than through official channels.\n\n### Grey Market: Direct Sales\n\nThe grey market became increasingly important during this period, as many individuals and businesses began to sell goods directly to consumers. This direct sales approach allowed individuals and businesses to bypass the official market and sell goods at higher prices.\n\n### Commerce and Industry\n\nThe commerce and industry sectors were also affected by the widespread black market. Many businesses began to use the black market to acquire goods and services that were not available through official channels.\n\n### Tacit Tolerance\n\nThe authorities began to tolerate the black market, as they realized that it was a necessary evil. Many officials and businessmen saw the black market as a way to acquire goods and services that were not available through official channels, and they began to turn a blind eye to its activities.\n\n#### No Longer Immoral\n\nThe black market was no longer seen as immoral or corrupt, but rather as a necessary institution. Many French citizens saw the black market as a way to survive in a time of scarcity and shortages.\n\n#### Nuanced and Refocused Enforcement\n\nThe authorities began to focus their enforcement efforts on the most egregious cases of black market activity, rather than trying to eradicate the institution entirely. This nuanced and refocused approach allowed the authorities to target the most serious offenders while tolerating the more minor infractions.\n\n### Metrics\n\nThe widespread black market in wartime France was characterized by a range of metrics, including the proportion of production, prices, and geographic distribution.\n\n#### Proportion of Production\n\nThe proportion of production that was diverted to the black market increased significantly during this period. Many businesses and individuals began to produce goods specifically for the black market, rather than for official channels.\n\n#### Higher and More Volatile Prices\n\nPrices on the black market became increasingly higher and more volatile. Many individuals and businesses began to charge exorbitant prices for goods and services, which further exacerbated the shortages and price increases.\n\n#### Geographic Distribution\n\nThe black market became increasingly widespread, with activities taking place in many different regions and cities. The geographic distribution of the black market allowed it to evade detection and enforcement efforts.\n\n#### Beneficiaries\n\nThe beneficiaries of the black market were many and varied, including individuals, businesses, and government officials. Many people saw the black market as a way to acquire goods and services that were not available through official channels, and they were willing to pay high prices to get them.\n\nPatriotism (Spring 1943-Summer 1944)\n\nThe black market in wartime France became increasingly politicized during the spring of 1943 and the summer of 1944.\n\n### Enforcement for the Occupiers\n\nThe authorities began to enforce the black market more strictly, particularly in areas that were seen as strategic or sensitive. The occupiers saw the black market as a threat to their control and began to crack down on its activities.\n\n#### Economic Pillage and the End of the German Black Market\n\nThe economic pillage of France by the German occupation authorities led to a decline in the black market. Many German officials and businessmen had used the black market to acquire goods and services, but as the war turned against them, they began to lose interest in the institution.\n\n#### Countermeasures and Collaboration\n\nThe French government and occupation authorities implemented a range of countermeasures to combat the black market, including arrests, fines, and other penalties. However, these measures were often ineffective, and the black market continued to thrive.\n\n#### Milice vs the Black Market\n\nThe Milice, a French paramilitary organization, was established to combat the black market and other forms of resistance. However, the Milice was often corrupt and ineffective, and it failed to eradicate the black market.\n\n### Fraud and Resistance\n\nThe black market became increasingly linked to the resistance movement during this period.\n\n#### Resistance Encouragement\n\nMany resistance groups encouraged the black market as a way to subvert the occupation authorities and acquire goods and services. The resistance saw the black market as a way to survive and continue their activities.\n\n#### Blaming the Resistance\n\nThe authorities began to blame the resistance for the black market, rather than acknowledging its widespread nature. This blame game allowed the authorities to justify their crackdown on the resistance and the black market.\n\n#### End of the Occupation\n\nThe end of the occupation in the summer of 1944 marked a significant turning point for the black market in France. Many of the restrictions and shortages that had characterized the occupation were lifted, and the black market began to decline.\n\nAfter the Liberation (1944-1949)\n\nThe black market in France continued to exist after the liberation, although it was significantly reduced in scale.\n\n### Épuration and Illicit Profits\n\nThe French government implemented a range of measures to punish those who had profited from the black market during the occupation. This épuration, or purification, process allowed the government to target those who had collaborated with the occupation authorities and profited from the black market.\n\n#### Pursuit and Punishment\n\nMany individuals and businesses were pursued and punished for their involvement in the black market. The government implemented a range of penalties, including fines, imprisonment, and confiscation of assets.\n\n#### Confiscation of Illicit Profits\n\nThe government confiscated many of the illicit profits that had been made during the occupation. This confiscation process allowed the government to recover some of the losses that had been incurred during the war.\n\n### Continued Black Market Operations\n\nDespite the efforts of the government to eradicate the black market, it continued to exist in some form.\n\n#### Continued Trafficking\n\nMany individuals and businesses continued to traffic in goods and services on the black market. This continued trafficking allowed the black market to survive, albeit in a reduced form.\n\n#### Generalized Fraud\n\nThe black market became increasingly associated with generalized fraud and corruption. Many individuals and businesses saw the black market as a way to make quick profits, regardless of the consequences.\n\n#### Government Powerlessness\n\nThe government was often powerless to stop the black market, despite its efforts. The black market was able to evade detection and enforcement efforts, and it continued to thrive.\n\n#### Towards the Free Market\n\nThe black market in France eventually gave way to a more free market economy. The government implemented a range of reforms to liberalize the economy and encourage competition, which helped to reduce the black market.\n\nHistorical Memory\n\nThe historical memory of the black market in France is complex and multifaceted.\n\n### Historiography\n\nThe historiography of the black market in France is characterized by a range of different approaches and interpretations. Some historians have seen the black market as a necessary evil, while others have condemned it as corrupt and immoral.\n\n### Collective Unconscious and Cultural Roots\n\nThe black market has a significant place in the collective unconscious and cultural roots of France. Many French people continue to see the black market as a way to survive and thrive in difficult times.\n\n#### Early Recollections\n\nMany early recollections of the black market in France are characterized by a sense of nostalgia and romance. The black market is often remembered as a time of excitement and adventure, rather than as a time of hardship and scarcity.\n\n#### Marcel Aymé\n\nThe French writer Marcel Aymé wrote extensively about the black market in his works. Aymé's writing often celebrated the black market as a symbol of French resistance and ingenuity.\n\n### Major Works\n\nSeveral major works have been written about the black market in France.\n\n#### La Traversée de Paris\n\nLa Traversée de Paris, a novel by Marcel Aymé, is set during the occupation and explores the black market in detail. The novel is a powerful portrayal of the black market and its impact on French society.\n\n#### Au bon beurre\n\nAu bon beurre, a film by Gilles Grangier, is a comedy-drama that explores the black market in rural France. The film is a light-hearted portrayal of the black market and its impact on rural communities.\n\n### Historical Figures\n\nSeveral historical figures have been associated with the black market in France.\n\n#### L'Étrange Monsieur Joseph\n\nL'Étrange Monsieur Joseph, a French resistance leader, was known for his involvement in the black market. Joseph's activities on the black market helped to subvert the occupation authorities and acquire goods and services for the resistance.\n\nSee Also\n\n* French Resistance\n* Vichy France\n* German occupation of France\n* Black market\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nCitations\n\nBibliography\n\nFurther Reading", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Black_market_in_wartime_France\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##1930s: inflation, instability and unrest\n##Fall of France\n#1940-1941\n##Origins\n###Rationing and price controls\n###Diversion from official channels\n###Clandestine networks\n###Hidden stockpiling\n###Grey market\n##Users of the black market\n###Privileged French\n###Occupation forces\n##Public response\n###Early condemnation\n###Participation\n###Housewives' demonstrations\n###Suspicions of hoarding\n###Official antisemitism\n###Public opinion\n###Political opposition\n##Response by authorities\n#Widespread black market (autumn 1941 to 1943)\n##Agricultural black market\n##Grey market: direct sales\n##Commerce and industry\n##Tacit tolerance\n###No longer immoral\n###Nuanced and refocused enforcement\n##Metrics\n###Proportion of production\n###Higher and more volatile prices\n###Geographic distribution\n###Beneficiaries\n#Patriotism (spring 1943-summer 1944)\n##Enforcement for the occupiers\n###Economic pillage and the end of the German black market\n###Countermeasures and collaboration\n###Milice vs the black market\n##Fraud and Resistance\n###Resistance encouragement\n###Blaming the Resistance\n###End of the occupation\n#After the Liberation (1944-1949)\n##Épuration and illicit profits\n###Pursuit and punishment\n###Confiscation of illicit profits\n##Continued black market operations\n###Continued trafficking\n###Generalized fraud\n###Government powerlessness\n###Towards the free market\n#Historical memory\n##Historiography\n##Collective unconscious and cultural roots\n###Early recollections\n###Marcel Aymé\n##Major works\n###La Traversée de Paris\n###Au bon beurre\n##Historical figures\n###L'Étrange Monsieur Joseph\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n##Citations\n##Bibliography\n#Further reading\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The film is the third installment in the Guardians of the Galaxy film series and the 32nd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The movie follows the Guardians as they face their greatest challenge yet, with the fate of the galaxy hanging in the balance.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe film takes place after the events of Avengers: Endgame and Spider-Man: No Way Home. The Guardians are on a mission to save the galaxy from the villainous High Evolutionary, who seeks to eradicate all life that is not genetically perfect. Along the way, they must confront their own personal demons and learn to work together as a team once again.\n\nAs the Guardians face off against the High Evolutionary, they are aided by a new ally, the humanoid dog Cosmo, who possesses superhuman strength and agility. However, they soon discover that the High Evolutionary has a personal connection to one of the Guardians, which makes the battle even more intense and emotional.\n\nThroughout the film, the Guardians must also deal with the consequences of their past actions, including the death of Gamora and the destruction of Xandar. They must come to terms with their losses and learn to move forward, all while facing their greatest challenge yet.\n\n# Cast\n\nThe film features an ensemble cast, including Chris Pratt as Peter Quill / Star-Lord, Zoe Saldana as Gamora, Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer, Karen Gillan as Nebula, and Bradley Cooper as the voice of Rocket Raccoon.

Gunn had a clear vision for the film, which he wanted to be the final installment in the Guardians trilogy.\n\nHowever, the film's development was put on hold due to the production of Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame. Gunn used this time to work on other projects, including the horror film Brightburn.\n\n### Firing of James Gunn\n\nIn July 2018, Gunn was fired from the film due to controversy surrounding his past tweets. The tweets, which were posted between 2008 and 2012, were deemed to be in poor taste and offensive.\n\nGunn's firing was met with widespread criticism from the cast and crew of the Guardians franchise. The cast, in particular, was vocal about their support for Gunn, with Pratt, Saldana, and Bautista all releasing statements in his defense.\n\n### Rehiring Gunn\n\nIn March 2019, Gunn was rehired as the director of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. The decision was made after a meeting between Gunn and Disney CEO Bob Iger, during which Gunn apologized for his past behavior and assured Iger that he had grown and learned from his mistakes.\n\nGunn's rehiring was met with widespread celebration from the cast and crew of the Guardians franchise. The film's production was able to move forward, with Gunn returning to his role as writer and director.\n\n## Pre-production\n\nPre-production on the film began in 2019, with Gunn working on the script and the cast undergoing training and rehearsals.\n\nThe film's budget was increased significantly, with a reported budget of over $250 million. The increased budget allowed for more complex action sequences and visual effects.\n\n## Filming\n\nFilming on the film began in November 2021 and lasted for several months. The film was shot on location in Atlanta, Georgia, and London, England.\n\nThe film's action sequences were complex and physically demanding, with the cast undergoing extensive training to prepare. Pratt, in particular, had to perform many of his own stunts, which added to the film's authenticity.\n\n## Post-production\n\nPost-production on the film began in 2022, with Gunn working on the editing and visual effects.\n\nThe film's visual effects were created by a team of artists and technicians, who worked tirelessly to bring the film's complex action sequences and alien worlds to life.\n\n# Music\n\nThe film's score was composed by John Murphy, who previously worked on the score for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.\n\nThe score features a mix of orchestral and choral pieces, which add to the film's epic and emotional scope. The film also features several classic rock songs, which are used to great effect in the film's action sequences and emotional scenes.\n\n# Marketing\n\nThe film's marketing campaign began in 2022, with the release of several trailers and TV spots.\n\nThe trailers featured footage from the film, including action sequences and emotional scenes.

The film's opening weekend was particularly successful, with the film grossing over $120 million in the United States alone.\n\nThe film's success was due in part to its positive word-of-mouth and critical reception.

The crisis began in July 2022 and continued until August 2024, with periods of relative calm punctuated by outbreaks of violence and diplomatic tensions.\n\n#Background\n\nThe crisis was rooted in the complex and disputed status of Kosovo, which declared independence from Serbia in 2008. However, Serbia does not recognize Kosovo's independence and considers it a province. The northern region of Kosovo, which borders Serbia, has a majority ethnic Serb population and has historically been a source of tension between the two countries.\n\nIn the years leading up to the crisis, there were ongoing efforts to normalize relations between Kosovo and Serbia, including the 2020 Washington Agreement, which aimed to establish economic ties and improve relations between the two countries. However, these efforts were met with resistance from some ethnic Serb communities in northern Kosovo, who feared that recognition of Kosovo's independence would lead to their marginalization and exclusion from Serbian society.\n\n#Timeline\n\n##2022\n\n###July\n\nThe crisis began in July 2022, when the Kosovo government announced plans to introduce a new license plate system, which would replace the existing system used in northern Kosovo. The move was seen as an attempt to assert Kosovo's sovereignty over the region and was met with resistance from ethnic Serb communities, who argued that it was an attempt to erase their Serbian identity.\n\nTensions escalated on July 31, when a group of ethnic Serb protesters blocked the roads leading to the Jarinje and Brnjak border crossings, which connect northern Kosovo to Serbia. The protesters demanded that the Kosovo government reverse its decision on the license plate system and recognize the rights of ethnic Serbs in the region.\n\n###August\n\nIn August, the situation deteriorated further, with reports of violence and intimidation against ethnic Serb communities in northern Kosovo. On August 15, a group of masked men attacked a Kosovo police station in the town of Zubin Potok, injuring several officers.\n\nThe international community, including the European Union and the United States, called for calm and restraint, urging both sides to engage in dialogue and find a peaceful resolution to the crisis.\n\n###September\n\nIn September, the Kosovo government announced that it would postpone the introduction of the new license plate system, in an effort to reduce tensions and create space for dialogue. However, the move was met with skepticism by some ethnic Serb communities, who argued that it was too little, too late.\n\n###October\n\nIn October, the situation remained tense, with periodic outbreaks of violence and protests. On October 15, a group of ethnic Serb protesters clashed with Kosovo police in the town of Mitrovica, resulting in several injuries.\n\n###November\n\nIn November, the international community increased pressure on both sides to engage in dialogue and find a peaceful resolution to the crisis. On November 15, the European Union facilitated a meeting between the Kosovo and Serbian prime ministers, which resulted in a joint statement calling for calm and restraint.\n\n###December\n\nIn December, the situation remained calm, with both sides engaging in low-level talks and exploring options for a peaceful resolution to the crisis. However, the underlying tensions and disagreements remained, and the crisis was far from resolved.\n\n##2023\n\n###January\n\nIn January, the Kosovo government announced plans to establish a new municipality in northern Kosovo, which would be dominated by ethnic Serbs. The move was seen as an attempt to address some of the concerns of ethnic Serb communities and create a more inclusive and representative local government.\n\n###February\n\nIn February, the situation remained calm, with both sides engaging in talks and exploring options for a peaceful resolution to the crisis. On February 15, the European Union facilitated a meeting between the Kosovo and Serbian prime ministers, which resulted in a joint statement calling for further dialogue and cooperation.\n\n###March\n\nIn March, the international community increased pressure on both sides to make progress in the talks and find a peaceful resolution to the crisis. On March 15, the United States imposed sanctions on several Serbian officials, citing their role in obstructing the normalization of relations between Kosovo and Serbia.\n\n###April\n\nIn April, the situation remained tense, with periodic outbreaks of violence and protests. On April 15, a group of ethnic Serb protesters clashed with Kosovo police in the town of Mitrovica, resulting in several injuries.\n\n###May\n\nIn May, the Kosovo government announced plans to introduce a new law on the use of languages, which would recognize Serbian as an official language in northern Kosovo. The move was seen as an attempt to address some of the concerns of ethnic Serb communities and create a more inclusive and representative society.\n\n###June\n\nIn June, the situation remained calm, with both sides engaging in talks and exploring options for a peaceful resolution to the crisis. On June 15, the European Union facilitated a meeting between the Kosovo and Serbian prime ministers, which resulted in a joint statement calling for further dialogue and cooperation.\n\n###July\n\nIn July, the international community increased pressure on both sides to make progress in the talks and find a peaceful resolution to the crisis. On July 15, the United States imposed additional sanctions on several Serbian officials, citing their role in obstructing the normalization of relations between Kosovo and Serbia.\n\n###September\n\nIn September, the situation remained tense, with periodic outbreaks of violence and protests. On September 15, a group of ethnic Serb protesters clashed with Kosovo police in the town of Zubin Potok, resulting in several injuries.\n\n###October\n\nIn October, the Kosovo government announced plans to establish a new police unit in northern Kosovo, which would be composed of ethnic Serb officers. The move was seen as an attempt to address some of the concerns of ethnic Serb communities and create a more inclusive and representative law enforcement agency.\n\n###November\n\nIn November, the situation remained calm, with both sides engaging in talks and exploring options for a peaceful resolution to the crisis. On November 15, the European Union facilitated a meeting between the Kosovo and Serbian prime ministers, which resulted in a joint statement calling for further dialogue and cooperation.\n\n###December\n\nIn December, the situation remained calm, with both sides engaging in low-level talks and exploring options for a peaceful resolution to the crisis. However, the underlying tensions and disagreements remained, and the crisis was far from resolved.\n\n##2024\n\n###February\n\nIn February, the international community increased pressure on both sides to make progress in the talks and find a peaceful resolution to the crisis. On February 15, the United States imposed additional sanctions on several Serbian officials, citing their role in obstructing the normalization of relations between Kosovo and Serbia.\n\n###August\n\nIn August, the situation finally began to show signs of improvement, with both sides engaging in high-level talks and exploring options for a peaceful resolution to the crisis. On August 15, the Kosovo and Serbian prime ministers met in Brussels, where they signed a landmark agreement on the normalization of relations between the two countries. The agreement marked a significant breakthrough in the crisis and paved the way for a more peaceful and stable future for the region.\n\n#Reactions\n\nThe international community played a crucial role in responding to the North Kosovo crisis, with the European Union and the United States taking a leading role in facilitating dialogue and imposing pressure on both sides to find a peaceful resolution.\n\nThe crisis also had significant regional implications, with neighboring countries such as Albania and Macedonia expressing concern about the potential for spillover and instability.\n\n#See also\n\n* Kosovo–Serbia relations\n* Kosovo independence declaration\n* 2020 Washington Agreement\n* European Union–Kosovo relations\n* United States–Kosovo relations", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"North_Kosovo_crisis_(2022–2024)\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Timeline\n##2022\n###July\n###August\n###September\n###October\n###November\n###December\n##2023\n###January\n###February\n###March\n###April\n###May\n###June\n###July\n###September\n###October\n###November\n###December\n##2024\n###February\n###August\n#Reactions\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The group consisted of England, Iran, United States, and Wales. The teams played each other in a round-robin format, with the top two teams advancing to the knockout stage.\n\n# Teams\n\nThe four teams in Group B were:\n\n*  England\n*  Iran\n*  United States\n*  Wales\n\nThese teams were drawn into Group B during the 2022 FIFA World Cup draw, which took place on April 1, 2022, in Doha, Qatar.\n\n# LGBT symbol incidents\n\nDuring the 2022 FIFA World Cup, several teams and players faced controversy and backlash for their attempts to show support for the LGBT community. Group B teams were no exception, with two incidents occurring during the group stage.\n\n## Captains' armbands\n\nSeveral teams, including England and Wales, had planned to wear rainbow-colored captains' armbands during their matches to show support for the LGBT community. However, FIFA threatened to impose disciplinary action on any team that did so, citing a breach of their rules.\n\nAs a result, both England and Wales abandoned their plans to wear the armbands, instead opting to wear FIFA-approved armbands with the slogan \"No Discrimination.\" The decision was met with widespread criticism from LGBT rights groups and fans.\n\n## Other Pride items\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding the captains' armbands, some teams and players still found ways to show their support for the LGBT community.

He is remembered as a hero and a martyr, and his legacy continues to inspire and motivate people to this day. This article provides an overview of his life, his martyrdom, and his lasting impact on the world.\n\n# Early and Personal Life\n\nNilesh Naik was born on August 10, 1974, in the small village of Amboli in the state of Maharashtra, India. He grew up in a modest family with his parents and two siblings. Naik's early life was marked by a strong sense of patriotism and a desire to serve his country. He was an average student in school but was always drawn to extracurricular activities such as sports and volunteering.\n\nNaik's interest in the military began at a young age, and he often spoke about joining the armed forces to his friends and family. After completing his secondary education, he enrolled in a local college to pursue a degree in commerce. However, his true passion lay elsewhere, and he soon dropped out of college to join the Indian Army.\n\n## Military Career\n\nNaik joined the Indian Army in 1995 and underwent rigorous training at the Army Training Centre in Pune. He was commissioned as a soldier in the 15th Battalion of the Maratha Light Infantry, a prestigious regiment known for its bravery and valor. Naik quickly rose through the ranks, earning the respect and admiration of his superiors and peers.\n\nDuring his time in the army, Naik was deployed in various parts of the country, including the disputed region of Jammu and Kashmir. He was involved in several counter-insurgency operations and was known for his bravery and tactical skills. Naik's dedication to his duty and his country was unwavering, and he was willing to make the ultimate sacrifice to protect his fellow soldiers and civilians.\n\n# Martyrdom\n\nOn May 30, 2008, Naik's unit was deployed in the Kupwara district of Jammu and Kashmir. The region was a hotbed of militant activity, and the Indian Army was engaged in a fierce battle against separatist groups. Naik's unit was tasked with conducting a search operation in a remote village when they came under heavy fire from militants.\n\nNaik, who was then a Lance Havildar, showed exceptional bravery and leadership during the battle. He rallied his troops and launched a counterattack against the militants, taking out several enemy positions. However, during the exchange of fire, Naik was hit by a bullet in the chest. Despite his injuries, he continued to fight, inspiring his comrades to push forward.\n\nNaik's actions that day were nothing short of heroic. He single-handedly took out several militant positions, allowing his unit to advance and secure the area. However, his injuries were too severe, and he succumbed to his wounds, sacrificing his life for his country.\n\n# Burial\n\nNaik's body was brought back to his hometown of Amboli, where he was given a hero's farewell. His funeral was attended by thousands of people, including his family, friends, and fellow soldiers. The Indian Army gave him a full military honors farewell, with a 21-gun salute and a flypast by Indian Air Force planes.\n\nNaik was laid to rest in his family's ancestral cemetery, where his grave has become a place of pilgrimage for many people. His family and friends remember him as a hero and a martyr, and his legacy continues to inspire and motivate people to this day.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nNaik's martyrdom sent shockwaves across the country, and he was hailed as a hero by the Indian media and the public. The Indian Army awarded him the Shaurya Chakra, a prestigious gallantry award, for his bravery and selfless sacrifice.\n\nNaik's family was awarded a compensation package by the Indian government, which included a cash award, a job for his wife, and free education for his children. However, for Naik's family, no amount of compensation can replace the loss of their loved one. They continue to miss him dearly and remember him as a hero and a martyr.\n\n# Legacy\n\nNaik's legacy extends far beyond his martyrdom. He is remembered as a hero and a role model by many people, especially in his hometown of Amboli. The Indian Army has named a barracks after him, and a statue of Naik has been erected in his hometown.\n\nNaik's story has also inspired several books and films, including a Bollywood movie that tells the story of his life and martyrdom. His legacy continues to motivate and inspire people to serve their country and make sacrifices for the greater good.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of Indian gallantry award recipients\n* Maratha Light Infantry\n* Indian Army\n* Jammu and Kashmir\n\n# References\n\n-none-\n\n# External links\n\n-none-", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Nilesh_Naik\" following this outline:\n\n#Early and personal life\n#Martyrdom\n#Burial\n#Aftermath\n#Legacy\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
