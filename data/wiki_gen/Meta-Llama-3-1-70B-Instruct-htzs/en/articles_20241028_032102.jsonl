From its early beginnings as a necessary means of survival to its current status as a popular sport, rock climbing has evolved significantly over time. This article will explore the history of rock climbing, highlighting key events, milestones, and developments that have shaped the sport into what it is today.\n\n#Origins\n\nThe earliest recorded evidence of rock climbing dates back to ancient civilizations in Egypt, Greece, and China, where people would climb rocks and mountains for spiritual, practical, and recreational purposes. In these early times, rock climbing was not a distinct sport, but rather a means to an end, such as accessing remote areas, hunting, or seeking spiritual enlightenment.\n\nIn many ancient cultures, mountains and rocks held spiritual significance, and climbing was a way to connect with the divine or to demonstrate spiritual prowess. For example, in ancient Greece, climbers would ascend Mount Olympus to reach the realm of the gods. Similarly, in ancient China, Taoist monks would climb mountains to meditate and seek enlightenment.\n\n#19th century\n\nDuring the 19th century, rock climbing began to take on a more recreational form, particularly in Europe. The first recorded rock climb in the Alps was made by a group of Englishmen in 1854, who ascended the Wetterhorn in Switzerland. This marked the beginning of a new era in rock climbing, as people began to climb for pleasure and adventure rather than just for necessity.\n\nThe development of mountaineering clubs, such as the Alpine Club in London (founded in 1857), helped to promote rock climbing as a sport. These clubs provided a platform for climbers to share knowledge, techniques, and experiences, and to plan and execute expeditions.\n\n#1900s\n\nThe early 20th century saw significant advancements in rock climbing technology and techniques. The introduction of pitons, carabiners, and ropes enabled climbers to tackle more challenging routes and to climb with greater safety.\n\nIn the United States, the Sierra Club, founded in 1892, played a crucial role in promoting rock climbing and conservation. The club's leader, John Muir, was a passionate advocate for the preservation of wilderness areas and the promotion of outdoor activities, including rock climbing.\n\n#1910s\n\nThe 1910s saw the rise of competitive rock climbing, with the first climbing competitions held in the United States and Europe. These early competitions were often informal and disorganized, but they marked the beginning of a new era in rock climbing, as climbers began to compete against each other for speed, style, and difficulty.\n\n#1920s\n\nThe 1920s were a golden age for rock climbing, with many notable first ascents and pioneering expeditions. The development of new techniques, such as the use of crampons and ice axes, enabled climbers to tackle more challenging routes and to explore new areas.\n\nIn the United States, the 1920s saw the rise of the \"Sierra Club style\" of climbing, characterized by a focus on minimalism, self-reliance, and environmentalism.

Climbers were used for reconnaissance, sabotage, and other special operations, and many climbers saw action in various theaters around the world.\n\nIn the aftermath of the war, rock climbing experienced a significant surge in popularity, as people sought out new outdoor activities and adventures.\n\n#1950s\n\nThe 1950s were a time of great change and innovation in rock climbing, with many notable first ascents and pioneering expeditions. The development of new techniques, such as the use of expansion bolts and piton hammers, enabled climbers to tackle more challenging routes and to explore new areas.\n\nIn the United States, the 1950s saw the rise of the \"Yosemite style\" of climbing, characterized by a focus on big walls, long routes, and technical difficulty. This approach to climbing emphasized the importance of physical conditioning, mental toughness, and teamwork.\n\n#1960s\n\nThe 1960s were a time of great social and cultural change, and rock climbing was no exception. The rise of the counterculture movement and the development of new outdoor activities, such as backpacking and camping, helped to popularize rock climbing and to bring it into the mainstream.\n\nIn Europe, the 1960s saw the rise of the \"alpine style\" of climbing, characterized by a focus on long routes, technical difficulty, and self-reliance. This approach to climbing emphasized the importance of physical conditioning, mental toughness, and teamwork.\n\n#1970s\n\nThe 1970s were a time of great innovation and experimentation in rock climbing, with many notable first ascents and pioneering expeditions.

The film is a remake of the 2017 Tamil film of the same name and follows the cat-and-mouse game between a police officer and a gangster.\n\n#Plot\n\nThe film tells the story of Vikram (Saif Ali Khan), a police officer who is tasked with tracking down Vedha (Hrithik Roshan), a notorious gangster. Vikram is a straight-laced and principled officer who believes in the law, while Vedha is a ruthless and cunning criminal who will stop at nothing to achieve his goals. As the chase between the two men intensifies, Vikram begins to realize that there is more to Vedha's story than meets the eye, and that the line between good and evil is not always clear-cut.\n\nAs the story unfolds, it becomes clear that Vedha is not just a common gangster, but a complex and multifaceted character with a troubled past. Through a series of flashbacks, the film reveals the events that led Vedha to become the person he is today, and the motivations behind his actions. Meanwhile, Vikram's own personal life is revealed, including his strained relationship with his wife and his struggles with the moral implications of his work.\n\nAs the cat-and-mouse game between Vikram and Vedha reaches its climax, the two men engage in a series of intense and violent confrontations. But even as the action unfolds, the film raises important questions about the nature of justice and the morality of taking a life. Ultimately, the film builds towards a shocking and unexpected conclusion that challenges the audience's assumptions about the characters and their motivations.\n\n#Cast\n\n* Hrithik Roshan as Vedha\n* Saif Ali Khan as Vikram\n* Radhika Apte as Priya\n* Rohit Saraf as Shatak\n* Yogita Bihani as Chanda\n* Sharib Hashmi as Babloo\n* Satyadeep Misra as SSP Abbas\n\n#Production\n\n##Development\n\nThe film was first announced in 2019, with Pushkar–Gayathri attached to direct and Hrithik Roshan and Saif Ali Khan set to star. The film is a remake of the 2017 Tamil film of the same name, which was also directed by Pushkar–Gayathri and starred R. Madhavan and Vijay Sethupathi. The Hindi remake was produced by Neeraj Pandey and Reliance Entertainment.\n\n##Casting\n\nHrithik Roshan was the first actor to be cast in the film, and he was reportedly drawn to the project because of the complexity and nuance of the character of Vedha.

It is one of the oldest human technologies, with evidence of pottery dating back to around 9000 BC. Pottery has played a significant role in human culture, serving both practical and aesthetic purposes.\n\nMain types\n-----------\n\nThere are several main types of pottery, each with its own unique characteristics and uses.\n\n### Earthenware\n\nEarthenware is a type of pottery that is fired at a relatively low temperature, typically between 1000°C and 1150°C. It is often made from clay that is rich in iron and other minerals, which gives it a distinctive red or yellow color. Earthenware is often used to make functional items such as plates, bowls, and cups, as well as decorative objects like vases and figurines.\n\n### Stoneware\n\nStoneware is a type of pottery that is fired at a higher temperature than earthenware, typically between 1150°C and 1300°C. It is often made from clay that is rich in silicates, which gives it a hard, dense, and often gray or beige color. Stoneware is often used to make functional items such as cups, bowls, and plates, as well as decorative objects like vases and sculptures.\n\n### Porcelain\n\nPorcelain is a type of pottery that is fired at a very high temperature, typically between 1250°C and 1400°C. It is often made from a type of clay called kaolin, which is rich in silicates and gives porcelain its characteristic whiteness and translucency. Porcelain is often used to make decorative objects like vases, figurines, and intricate sculptures.\n\nArchaeology\n------------\n\nPottery has played a significant role in archaeology, helping to date and reconstruct ancient cultures.\n\n### Fabric analysis\n\nFabric analysis is a technique used to study the texture and composition of pottery. By analyzing the fabric of pottery, archaeologists can gain insights into the materials and techniques used to make it, as well as the cultural and historical context in which it was created.\n\nClay bodies and raw materials\n-----------------------------\n\nPottery is made from clay, which is a type of fine-grained earth material that is rich in silicates and other minerals. There are several types of clay, each with its own unique characteristics and uses.\n\nProduction\n------------\n\nThe production of pottery involves several stages, from shaping and drying to firing and decorating.\n\n### Shaping\n\nShaping is the process of creating the desired form and shape of the pottery. This can be done by hand, using techniques such as coiling, pinching, or throwing, or by machine, using a potter's wheel or other equipment.\n\n### Drying\n\nDrying is the process of removing excess moisture from the pottery. This can be done slowly, over several days or weeks, or more quickly, using specialized equipment such as a drying room or a kiln.\n\n### Firing\n\nFiring is the process of heating the pottery to a high temperature, typically between 1000°C and 1400°C, in order to achieve the desired hardness, color, and texture.\n\n#### Temperature\n\nThe temperature at which pottery is fired depends on the type of clay and the desired outcome. Earthenware is typically fired at a relatively low temperature, around 1000°C to 1150°C, while stoneware and porcelain are fired at higher temperatures, up to 1400°C.\n\n#### Atmosphere\n\nThe atmosphere in which pottery is fired can also affect the outcome. A reducing atmosphere, which is low in oxygen, can produce a range of colors and effects, while an oxidizing atmosphere can produce a more uniform and predictable result.\n\n#### Methods\n\nThere are several methods of firing pottery, including:\n\n* Electric kilns, which use electricity to heat the pottery\n* Gas kilns, which use gas to heat the pottery\n* Wood-fired kilns, which use wood to heat the pottery\n* Raku kilns, which use a combination of gas and wood to heat the pottery\n\n#### Stages\n\nThe firing process typically involves several stages, including:\n\n* Bisque firing, which involves firing the pottery at a low temperature to remove excess moisture and create a hard, brittle surface\n* Glaze firing, which involves firing the pottery at a higher temperature to melt and set the glaze\n* Reduction firing, which involves firing the pottery in a reducing atmosphere to produce a range of colors and effects\n\n### Decorating\n\nDecorating is the process of adding color, pattern, and other visual effects to the pottery. This can be done using a range of techniques, including:\n\n* Glazing, which involves applying a layer of glaze to the pottery\n* Underglaze painting, which involves applying paint to the pottery before glazing\n* Overglaze enameling, which involves applying a layer of enamel to the pottery after glazing\n\n### Methods\n\nThere are several methods of decorating pottery, including:\n\n* Hand-painting, which involves painting the pottery by hand\n* Screen printing, which involves using a screen to print designs onto the pottery\n* Transfer printing, which involves using a transfer to print designs onto the pottery\n\n### Glazing\n\nGlazing is the process of applying a layer of glaze to the pottery. Glaze is a type of glass-like material that is made from a combination of chemicals and minerals. There are several types of glaze, each with its own unique characteristics and effects.\n\n### Health and environmental issues\n\nThe production of pottery can raise a number of health and environmental issues, including:\n\n* Exposure to dust and other airborne particles\n* Exposure to chemicals and other hazardous substances\n* Waste and pollution from the firing process\n* Energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions\n\nHistory\n--------\n\nPottery has a long and varied history, with evidence of pottery dating back to around 9000 BC.\n\n### Early pottery\n\nThe earliest pottery was likely made by accident, when people first discovered that clay could be shaped and fired to create hard, durable objects. As people began to experiment with pottery, they developed new techniques and technologies, such as the potter's wheel and the kiln.\n\n### History by region\n\nPottery has played a significant role in many different cultures and regions around the world.\n\n#### Beginnings of pottery\n\nThe beginnings of pottery are not well-documented, but it is believed that pottery originated in the Near East, where archaeologists have found evidence of pottery dating back to around 9000 BC.\n\n#### East Asia\n\nPottery has a long and rich history in East Asia, where it has been used for both practical and decorative purposes. Chinese pottery, in particular, is renowned for its beauty and sophistication.\n\n#### South Asia\n\nPottery has also played a significant role in South Asia, where it has been used for both practical and decorative purposes.

The exodus occurred in the early 1990s, during the Kashmir insurgency, and resulted in the displacement of approximately 100,000 Kashmiri Hindus from their ancestral homeland.\n\n#Background\n\nKashmiri Hindus, also known as Kashmiri Pandits, have a long history in the Kashmir Valley, dating back to the 3rd century BCE. They are the original inhabitants of the valley and have played a significant role in shaping its culture, language, and traditions. Prior to the exodus, Kashmiri Hindus made up approximately 15% of the population of the Kashmir Valley.\n\nIn the late 1980s, the Kashmir Valley began to experience a surge in insurgency activity, led by separatist groups seeking independence from India or merger with Pakistan. The insurgency was fueled by a combination of factors, including economic grievances, political marginalization, and the influence of Islamist ideology.\n\n#Insurgency activity\n\nThe insurgency in Kashmir was marked by widespread violence, including attacks on civilians, security forces, and government installations. Kashmiri Hindus, who were seen as a symbol of Indian authority, became a primary target of the insurgents.\n\n##Attack and threats\n\nKashmiri Hindus faced a wave of attacks and threats from insurgent groups, including the Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) and the Hizbul Mujahideen. Many Kashmiri Hindus were killed, injured, or forced to flee their homes due to the violence. Women were particularly vulnerable, with many cases of rape, abduction, and forced marriage reported.\n\nThe attacks on Kashmiri Hindus were often accompanied by threats and warnings, which included letters, posters, and public announcements. These threats demanded that Kashmiri Hindus leave the valley or face consequences. Many Kashmiri Hindus were also forced to pay extortion money to insurgent groups or face violence.\n\n#Aftermath\n\nThe exodus of Kashmiri Hindus from the Kashmir Valley was a gradual process, with many families leaving in the early 1990s. The exact number of Kashmiri Hindus who left the valley is disputed, but estimates range from 100,000 to 350,000.\n\nThe exodus had a profound impact on the Kashmir Valley, leading to a significant shift in its demographic and cultural landscape. Many Kashmiri Hindus were forced to leave behind their homes, businesses, and livelihoods, leading to widespread poverty and displacement.\n\n#Rehabilitation\n\nThe Indian government established several rehabilitation camps for Kashmiri Hindus who had fled the valley. These camps provided basic amenities, including food, shelter, and medical care. However, many Kashmiri Hindus faced significant challenges in rebuilding their lives, including finding employment and accessing education and healthcare.\n\nIn recent years, there have been efforts to rehabilitate Kashmiri Hindus in the Kashmir Valley. The Indian government has established several schemes to promote the return of Kashmiri Hindus, including the provision of financial incentives and housing. However, many Kashmiri Hindus remain skeptical about returning to the valley, citing concerns about safety and security.\n\n#In popular culture\n\nThe exodus of Kashmiri Hindus has been the subject of several books, movies, and documentaries.\n\n##Books\n\n* \"Our Moon Has Blood Clots\" by Rahul Pandita: A memoir about the author's experiences as a Kashmiri Hindu during the exodus.\n* \"The Kashmiri Pandits: A Longing for Home\" by Ashok Dhar: A collection of essays about the history and culture of Kashmiri Hindus.\n* \"The Lost City of K\" by Ashwin Sanghi: A novel that explores the history and mythology of Kashmir.\n\n##Movies\n\n* \"Shikara\" (2020): A Bollywood film directed by Vidhu Vinod Chopra, which tells the story of a Kashmiri Hindu couple who are forced to flee the valley during the exodus.\n* \"The Kashmir Files\" (2022): A Bollywood film directed by Vivek Agnihotri, which explores the exodus of Kashmiri Hindus and its aftermath.\n\n#See also\n\n* Kashmir insurgency\n* Kashmir conflict\n* Kashmiri Pandit\n* Jammu and Kashmir\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is a factual account of the exodus of Kashmiri Hindus from the Kashmir Valley.

Heard\n\nDepp v. Heard was a highly publicized defamation trial between American actor Johnny Depp and his ex-wife Amber Heard. The trial was a culmination of a long-standing dispute between the two, stemming from their tumultuous relationship and subsequent allegations of domestic abuse.\n\n# Background\n\n## Depp and Heard's relationship\n\nJohnny Depp and Amber Heard met in 2009 on the set of the film \"The Rum Diary.\" They began a romantic relationship in 2012 and got married in 2015. However, their marriage was short-lived, and they filed for divorce in 2016. The divorce proceedings were highly publicized, with both parties accusing each other of domestic abuse.\n\n## Depp v News Group Newspapers Ltd\n\nIn 2018, Johnny Depp sued the publisher of The Sun, News Group Newspapers Ltd, over an article that referred to him as a \"wife beater.\" The article was based on allegations made by Amber Heard during their divorce proceedings. The trial took place in the UK, and Depp lost the case, with the judge ruling that the article was \"substantially true.\"\n\n## Heard's op-ed in The Washington Post\n\nIn 2018, Amber Heard wrote an op-ed for The Washington Post, in which she referred to herself as a survivor of domestic abuse. Although she did not mention Johnny Depp by name, many interpreted the article as a reference to their relationship. Depp's lawyers later argued that the op-ed was a clear reference to him and that it had damaged his reputation.\n\n## Waldman's comments in the Daily Mail\n\nIn 2020, Adam Waldman, a lawyer representing Johnny Depp, made comments to the Daily Mail in which he referred to Amber Heard's allegations of abuse as a \"hoax.\" Depp's lawyers later argued that Heard had orchestrated a \"smear campaign\" against Depp, using the op-ed and other statements to damage his reputation.\n\n# Civil action\n\n## Pre-trial developments\n\nIn 2019, Johnny Depp filed a defamation lawsuit against Amber Heard, seeking $50 million in damages. The lawsuit was filed in Virginia, where The Washington Post is published. Heard counter-sued Depp for $100 million, alleging that he had orchestrated a \"smear campaign\" against her.\n\n## Trial\n\nThe trial began in April 2022 and lasted for six weeks. The trial was highly publicized, with many news outlets covering the proceedings.\n\n### Opening statements\n\nThe trial began with opening statements from both sides. Depp's lawyers argued that Heard's op-ed had damaged his reputation and that she had fabricated allegations of abuse. Heard's lawyers argued that Depp had a history of substance abuse and that he had physically and emotionally abused her during their relationship.\n\n### Testimony\n\nDuring the trial, both Depp and Heard took the stand to testify. Depp denied allegations of abuse, stating that Heard had been the aggressor in their relationship. Heard, on the other hand, testified that Depp had physically and emotionally abused her on multiple occasions.\n\n### Closing arguments\n\nThe trial concluded with closing arguments from both sides. Depp's lawyers argued that Heard's allegations were \"false\" and that she had orchestrated a \"smear campaign\" against Depp. Heard's lawyers argued that Depp's behavior had been \"erratic\" and that he had a history of substance abuse.\n\n### Verdict\n\nOn June 1, 2022, the jury delivered a verdict in favor of Johnny Depp. The jury found that Amber Heard had defamed Depp in three statements in her op-ed. The jury awarded Depp $10.35 million in damages.\n\n## Post-trial motions\n\nAfter the verdict, Heard's lawyers filed a motion to set aside the verdict, arguing that the jury had been \"improperly influenced\" by outside factors. The motion was denied by the judge.\n\n## Appeals, settlement and carrier lawsuit\n\nHeard's lawyers subsequently filed an appeal, arguing that the trial had been \"unfair\" and that the verdict had been \"influenced\" by outside factors. In December 2022, it was announced that Depp and Heard had reached a settlement, with Heard agreeing to pay Depp $1 million. Depp subsequently dropped his lawsuit against Heard's insurance carrier, which had been sued for refusing to pay out on Heard's policy.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## Livestream\n\nThe trial was livestreamed on various platforms, including YouTube and social media. The livestream attracted millions of viewers, with many watching the trial in its entirety.\n\n## Social media coverage\n\nThe trial was widely covered on social media, with many users sharing their opinions on the case.

He was believed to have received support from Iran during his time in hiding.\n\n## Activities in Russia\n\nIn the 1990s, al-Zawahiri was suspected of involvement in Islamist militant activities in Russia's North Caucasus region. He was believed to have provided support to Chechen separatists fighting against Russian forces.\n\n## Activities in Egypt\n\nAl-Zawahiri maintained a network of Islamist militants in Egypt, despite the Egyptian government's efforts to suppress the group. He was suspected of involvement in several terrorist plots against Egyptian targets.\n\n## Activities and whereabouts after the September 11 attacks\n\nFollowing the September 11 attacks, al-Zawahiri went into hiding, and his whereabouts were unknown for several years.

The disaster took place during a football match between Arema FC and Persebaya Surabaya, resulting in one of the deadliest stadium disasters in history.\n\n#Background\nThe Kanjuruhan Stadium was a multi-purpose stadium located in Malang, East Java, Indonesia. The stadium had a seating capacity of approximately 38,000 spectators and was primarily used for football matches. On October 1, 2022, the stadium was hosting a match between Arema FC and Persebaya Surabaya, two local football teams. The match was highly anticipated, with a large crowd expected to attend.\n\n#Disaster\nThe disaster occurred when Arema FC fans stormed the field in response to their team's 3-2 loss to Persebaya Surabaya. The fans, who were mostly young men, began throwing objects and vandalizing the stadium. The situation escalated quickly, with fans setting fire to the stadium's seats and concession stands. The police responded by firing tear gas into the crowd, which caused panic and led to a stampede.\n\n#Casualties\nThe disaster resulted in a significant number of casualties. According to official reports, 135 people lost their lives, with many more injured. The victims were mostly young men, with some reports suggesting that many were teenagers.\n\n##Ages and genders\nThe ages of the victims ranged from 10 to 40 years old, with the majority being between 15 and 25 years old. The victims were mostly male, with only a few females reported among the dead.\n\n#Aftermath\nThe disaster led to widespread outrage and condemnation in Indonesia. The government announced a national day of mourning, and the football league was suspended indefinitely. The stadium was closed pending an investigation, and the police launched a probe into the incident.\n\n#Legal\nThe disaster raised questions about the liability of the stadium's management, the police, and the football clubs involved. The government announced that it would launch a thorough investigation into the incident, with a view to holding those responsible accountable.\n\n#Investigation\nThe investigation into the disaster was led by a joint fact-finding team, which included representatives from the police, the football federation, and the government.\n\n##Police\nThe police investigation focused on the role of the police in responding to the incident.

All 150 seats were up for election, with 67 seats being contested.\n\n#Background\n\nThe Texas House of Representatives is composed of 150 members, each representing a district within the state. Members are elected to two-year terms, with all seats up for election in even-numbered years. The 2022 election was the first to take place after the 2020 United States Census, which led to a redrawing of district boundaries.\n\n#Redistricting\n\nFollowing the 2020 census, the Texas Legislature was responsible for redrawing district boundaries to reflect changes in population. The new districts were drawn in 2021 and took effect for the 2022 election.\n\n##Seats without incumbents\n\nDue to redistricting, 22 seats were considered \"open\" or \"swing\" districts, meaning they did not have an incumbent representative running for re-election. These seats were highly contested, with both parties vying for control.\n\n##Double-bunked incumbents\n\nIn some cases, redistricting led to two incumbent representatives being drawn into the same district. This resulted in two legislators competing against each other in the primary or general election.\n\n#Retirements\n\nSeveral incumbent representatives announced their retirement or decision not to seek re-election in 2022. This opened up additional seats for challengers and contributed to the high number of contested races.\n\n#Special elections\n\nIn some cases, special elections were held to fill vacant seats prior to the 2022 general election. These elections provided insight into the competitiveness of certain districts and set the stage for the November election.\n\n#Incumbents defeated\n\nSeveral incumbent representatives were defeated in either the primary or general election.\n\n##In primaries\n\n###Democrats\n\nA number of Democratic incumbents faced primary challenges, with some ultimately losing their seats.\n\n###Republicans\n\nSimilarly, some Republican incumbents were defeated in primary contests, often by more conservative challengers.\n\n#Predictions\n\n##Statewide\n\nPolls and analysts predicted a relatively close contest between the two parties, with Republicans favored to maintain control of the House.\n\n##Competitive districts\n\nA number of districts were identified as competitive, with both parties having a realistic chance of winning.

It was a series of protests and armed conflicts between gold miners and the colonial authorities, culminating in the Battle of the Eureka Stockade. The rebellion was sparked by a combination of factors, including the introduction of a monthly mining tax, the lack of representation in the Legislative Council, and the corruption and inefficiency of the goldfields administration. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the origins, events, and aftermath of the Eureka Rebellion.\n\n**Origins in the Victorian gold rush**\n\nThe Victorian gold rush, which began in 1851, brought a massive influx of immigrants to the colony, many of whom were seeking to strike it rich on the goldfields. However, the colonial authorities were ill-prepared to manage the sudden growth in population, leading to widespread discontent and frustration among the miners.\n\n## **Protests on the goldfields: 1851–1854**\n\n### **La Trobe introduces monthly mining tax as protests begin**\n\nIn 1851, Governor Charles La Trobe introduced a monthly mining tax, which was seen as an attempt to raise revenue from the rapidly growing goldfields population. However, the miners saw the tax as unfair and an attempt to exploit their wealth. Protests began to erupt on the goldfields, with miners demanding representation in the Legislative Council and the abolition of the tax.\n\n### **First gold commissioner arrives in Ballarat**\n\nIn 1852, the first gold commissioner, David Armstrong, arrived in Ballarat to oversee the administration of the goldfields. However, Armstrong's attempts to enforce the mining tax and maintain order on the goldfields were met with resistance from the miners.\n\n### **Bendigo Petition and the Red Ribbon Movement**\n\nIn 1853, a petition was circulated in Bendigo, calling for the abolition of the mining tax and the establishment of a miners' representative in the Legislative Council. The petition was signed by over 23,000 miners, and it became a focal point for the growing protest movement. The Red Ribbon Movement, which emerged in response to the petition, was a series of protests and demonstrations that took place across the goldfields, with miners wearing red ribbons as a symbol of their solidarity.\n\n### **Legislative Council calls for Commission of Inquiry**\n\nIn response to the growing unrest on the goldfields, the Legislative Council called for a Commission of Inquiry to investigate the grievances of the miners. However, the commission's report, which was published in 1854, failed to address the key issues of the mining tax and representation in the Legislative Council.\n\n### **Hotham replaces La Trobe**\n\nIn 1854, Governor Charles Hotham replaced La Trobe as the governor of Victoria. Hotham was seen as a more authoritarian figure, and his appointment was met with skepticism by the miners.\n\n**Tensions escalate**\n\nThe appointment of Hotham as governor marked a turning point in the conflict between the miners and the colonial authorities. Tensions began to escalate, and the miners became increasingly militant in their demands for reform.\n\n## **Murder of James Scobie and the burning of the Eureka hotel**\n\nIn October 1854, a miner named James Scobie was murdered outside the Eureka Hotel in Ballarat. The hotel, which was owned by a man named Bentley, was a popular gathering place for miners, and it was seen as a symbol of the goldfields establishment. In response to Scobie's murder, a group of miners burned down the hotel, and Bentley was later charged with Scobie's murder.\n\n## **Ballarat Reform League meetings**\n\nIn the aftermath of the burning of the Eureka Hotel, a group of miners formed the Ballarat Reform League, which held a series of meetings to discuss the grievances of the miners. The league, which was led by a man named Peter Lalor, called for the establishment of a miners' representative in the Legislative Council and the abolition of the mining tax.\n\n## **Escalating violence as military convoy looted**\n\nIn November 1854, a military convoy was sent to Ballarat to quell the growing unrest. However, the convoy was looted by a group of miners, and the situation began to spiral out of control.\n\n**Open rebellion**\n\nThe events of November 1854 marked the beginning of an open rebellion by the miners against the colonial authorities. The miners, who were now armed and organized, began to take control of the goldfields, and the authorities were powerless to stop them.\n\n## **Paramilitary mobilisation and swearing allegiance to the Southern Cross**\n\nIn response to the growing rebellion, a group of miners formed a paramilitary organization, which was sworn in under the Southern Cross flag. The organization, which was led by Peter Lalor, was dedicated to defending the rights of the miners and establishing a new order on the goldfields.\n\n### **Fortification of the Eureka lead**\n\nThe miners, who were now in open rebellion, began to fortify the Eureka lead, which was a strategic location on the goldfields. The lead, which was surrounded by a stockade, was seen as a symbol of the miners' resistance to the authorities.\n\n#### **Vinegar Hill blunder: Irish dimension factors in dwindling numbers at stockade**\n\nHowever, a series of blunders, including a failed attack on a group of Irish miners at Vinegar Hill, led to a decline in support for the rebellion. Many miners, who were intimidated by the authorities, began to desert the stockade, and the rebellion began to falter.\n\n#### **Departing detachment of Independent Californian Rangers leaves small garrison behind**\n\nIn the aftermath of the Vinegar Hill blunder, a detachment of Independent Californian Rangers, who had been supporting the rebellion, departed the goldfields, leaving a small garrison behind. The garrison, which was led by Peter Lalor, was now vastly outnumbered by the authorities.\n\n## **Battle of the Eureka Stockade**\n\nOn December 3, 1854, the authorities, who were now determined to crush the rebellion, launched a final attack on the Eureka Stockade. The battle, which lasted for just 20 minutes, was a decisive victory for the authorities, and the rebellion was finally put down.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe aftermath of the Battle of the Eureka Stockade was marked by a series of trials and executions. However, the rebellion had a lasting impact on Australian history, and it paved the way for the establishment of democratic reforms in the colony.\n\n## **Trials for sedition and high treason**\n\nIn the aftermath of the rebellion, a series of trials were held, and several miners were charged with sedition and high treason. However, the trials were widely seen as a sham, and many of the accused were acquitted.\n\n## **Commission of Inquiry report**\n\nIn 1855, a Commission of Inquiry was established to investigate the causes of the rebellion. The commission's report, which was published in 1856, was highly critical of the authorities and recommended a series of democratic reforms.\n\n## **Peter Lalor enters parliament**\n\nIn 1856, Peter Lalor, who had led the rebellion, entered the Victorian parliament, where he became a vocal advocate for democratic reforms.\n\n**Location of Bakery Hill and the Eureka Stockade**\n\nThe Eureka Stockade was located on Bakery Hill, which is now a suburb of Ballarat. The site of the stockade is now commemorated by a monument, which was erected in 1889.\n\n**Political legacy**\n\nThe Eureka Rebellion had a lasting impact on Australian politics, and it paved the way for the establishment of democratic reforms in the colony. The rebellion also played a significant role in the development of Australian nationalism.\n\n**Commemoration**\n\nThe Eureka Rebellion has been commemorated in a variety of ways over the years.\n\n## **19th century**\n\nIn the 19th century, the rebellion was commemorated by a series of monuments and memorials, including the Eureka Monument, which was erected in 1889.\n\n## **20th century**\n\nIn the 20th century, the rebellion was commemorated by a series of events and exhibitions, including the Eureka Stockade Centenary Exhibition, which was held in 1954.\n\n## **21st century**\n\nIn the 21st century, the rebellion has been commemorated by a series of events and exhibitions, including the Eureka 150th Anniversary Exhibition, which was held in 2004.\n\n**Popular culture**\n\nThe Eureka Rebellion has been the subject of numerous works of popular culture, including films, plays, and novels.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Australian history\n* Victorian gold rush\n* Ballarat Reform League\n* Peter Lalor\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is a comprehensive overview of the Eureka Rebellion.

The album received generally positive reviews from music critics, with many praising the band's consistent sound and style.\n\n# Background and recording\n\nThose Once Loyal was recorded at Sable Rose Studios in Coventry, England, with the band producing the album themselves. The recording process was relatively straightforward, with the band laying down the tracks in a short amount of time. In an interview, vocalist Karl Willetts stated that the band had a clear idea of what they wanted to achieve with the album, and that the recording process was \"very smooth and easy\".\n\nThe band had been touring extensively in the years leading up to the album's release, and had been working on new material during their downtime. Guitarist Gavin Ward stated that the band had a \"stockpile\" of riffs and ideas that they had accumulated over the years, and that they were able to draw upon these when writing the album.\n\n# Composition\n\n## Music\n\nThe music on Those Once Loyal is characteristic of Bolt Thrower's signature sound, with slow to mid-paced tempos and heavy, distorted guitar riffs. The album features a mix of shorter, more aggressive tracks, as well as longer, more epic songs that showcase the band's ability to craft complex and atmospheric music.\n\nGuitarists Gavin Ward and Barry Thomson provide a dense and heavy sound, with their guitars often trading off in a call-and-response pattern. The rhythm section, comprising bassist Jo Bench and drummer Martin Kearns, provides a solid foundation for the album's heavy sound.\n\n## Lyrics\n\nThe lyrics on Those Once Loyal deal with themes of war, mortality, and the human condition.

In an interview, Willetts stated that he was inspired by the idea of \"those once loyal\" - individuals who have been worn down by the trials and tribulations of life, and who are struggling to maintain their sense of purpose and identity.\n\n## Title and artwork\n\nThe title \"Those Once Loyal\" refers to the idea of individuals who have been loyal to a particular cause or ideology, but who have become disillusioned and are struggling to maintain their commitment. The album's artwork features a striking image of a soldier standing alone on a battlefield, surrounded by the detritus of war.\n\nThe artwork was designed by the band themselves, with input from their record label. The image is meant to be a powerful and thought-provoking representation of the album's themes, and has been widely praised for its simplicity and effectiveness.\n\n# Release\n\n## Promotion\n\nThose Once Loyal was promoted through a series of live shows and tours, as well as through the band's record label and management.

The video for \"At First Light\" features footage of the band performing live, interspersed with images of war and destruction.\n\n## Those Still Loyal Tour\n\nIn support of the album, Bolt Thrower embarked on the \"Those Still Loyal\" tour, which took them to Europe, North America, and Australia. The tour featured a mix of headlining shows and festival appearances, and was widely praised for its intensity and energy.\n\nThe tour featured a number of special guests, including fellow metal bands Entombed and Godflesh. The shows were often sold-out, with fans eager to see the band perform their new material live.\n\n# Reception\n\n## Contemporaneous reviews\n\nThose Once Loyal received generally positive reviews from music critics upon its release. Many critics praised the band's consistent sound and style, as well as their ability to craft complex and atmospheric music.\n\nRolling Stone magazine praised the album's \"heavy, distorted guitar riffs\" and \"intense, aggressive sound\".

The album has been included on a number of \"best of\" lists, including those compiled by Metal Hammer and Terrorizer magazines.\n\nThe album has also been praised by other musicians, with many citing it as an influence on their own work. In an interview, vocalist Karl Willetts stated that he was proud of the album's enduring influence, and that it was a testament to the band's dedication and hard work.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThose Once Loyal was a commercial success, with the album selling well and receiving significant airplay on metal radio stations. The album's success helped to establish Bolt Thrower as one of the leading bands in the metal genre, and paved the way for their future releases.\n\nThe band has continued to tour and release new music in the years since the album's release, with their most recent album being 2014's \"The IVth Crusade\".

It is a common and potentially life-threatening condition that can occur in various settings, including high altitudes, underwater, and in patients with respiratory or cardiovascular diseases. Hypoxia can affect any tissue or organ in the body, but it is most critical when it affects the brain, heart, and other vital organs.\n\n# Classification\n\nHypoxia can be classified in several ways, depending on its cause, extent, and the tissues or organs affected.\n\n## By cause\n\nHypoxia can be caused by a variety of factors, including reduced oxygen supply, increased oxygen demand, or impaired oxygen utilization. The most common causes of hypoxia include ischemia, hypoxemic hypoxia, anemia, and histotoxic hypoxia.\n\n## By extent\n\nHypoxia can be classified as generalized or localized, depending on the extent of the affected area.\n\n### Generalized hypoxia\n\nGeneralized hypoxia occurs when there is a widespread deficiency of oxygen in the body's tissues. This can occur in patients with respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, or severe anemia.\n\n### Localized hypoxia\n\nLocalized hypoxia occurs when there is a deficiency of oxygen in a specific tissue or organ. This can occur in patients with ischemic heart disease, stroke, or peripheral artery disease.\n\n### By affected tissues and organs\n\nHypoxia can affect any tissue or organ in the body, but it is most critical when it affects the brain, heart, and other vital organs.\n\n#### Cerebral hypoxia\n\nCerebral hypoxia occurs when there is a deficiency of oxygen in the brain. This can occur in patients with stroke, traumatic brain injury, or cardiac arrest.\n\n#### Corneal hypoxia\n\nCorneal hypoxia occurs when there is a deficiency of oxygen in the cornea, the clear layer on the front of the eye. This can occur in patients with contact lens-related eye problems or corneal ulcers.\n\n#### Intrauterine hypoxia\n\nIntrauterine hypoxia occurs when there is a deficiency of oxygen in the fetus during pregnancy. This can occur in patients with placental insufficiency or umbilical cord problems.\n\n#### Tumor hypoxia\n\nTumor hypoxia occurs when there is a deficiency of oxygen in cancer cells. This can occur in patients with rapidly growing tumors or those with poor blood supply to the tumor.\n\n#### Vestibular system\n\nHypoxia can also affect the vestibular system, which is responsible for balance and equilibrium. This can occur in patients with inner ear problems or those who have experienced a head injury.\n\n# Signs and symptoms\n\nThe signs and symptoms of hypoxia can vary depending on the extent and severity of the condition. Common symptoms include:\n\n* Shortness of breath\n* Confusion or altered mental status\n* Headache\n* Fatigue\n* Weakness\n* Dizziness or lightheadedness\n* Chest pain or tightness\n* Pale or blue-tinged skin\n\n## Complications\n\nIf left untreated, hypoxia can lead to serious complications, including:\n\n* Organ failure\n* Cardiac arrest\n* Respiratory failure\n* Stroke\n* Coma\n* Death\n\n# Causes\n\nHypoxia can be caused by a variety of factors, including:\n\n## Ischemia\n\nIschemia occurs when there is a reduction in blood flow to a tissue or organ, resulting in a deficiency of oxygen. This can occur in patients with atherosclerosis, blood clots, or cardiac arrhythmias.\n\n## Hypoxemic hypoxia\n\nHypoxemic hypoxia occurs when there is a deficiency of oxygen in the blood. This can occur in patients with respiratory failure, altitude sickness, or carbon monoxide poisoning.\n\n### Carbon monoxide poisoning\n\nCarbon monoxide poisoning occurs when carbon monoxide binds to hemoglobin in the blood, reducing the amount of oxygen that can be carried to the tissues.\n\n### Altitude\n\nHigh altitude can cause hypoxia due to the lower oxygen levels in the air. This can occur in people who travel to high-altitude areas, such as mountains or airplanes.\n\n### Hypoxic breathing gases\n\nHypoxic breathing gases can cause hypoxia by reducing the amount of oxygen available to the body. This can occur in patients who use anesthesia or sedation.\n\n### Other\n\nOther causes of hypoxemic hypoxia include anemia, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n\n## Anemia\n\nAnemia occurs when there is a deficiency of red blood cells or hemoglobin in the blood, reducing the amount of oxygen that can be carried to the tissues.\n\n## Histotoxic hypoxia\n\nHistotoxic hypoxia occurs when there is a deficiency of oxygen in the tissues due to impaired oxygen utilization. This can occur in patients with cyanide poisoning or certain medications.\n\n# Mechanism\n\nThe mechanism of hypoxia involves a complex interplay between oxygen supply, demand, and utilization.\n\n## Physiological responses\n\nThe body has several physiological responses to hypoxia, including:\n\n* Increased ventilation\n* Increased heart rate\n* Increased blood pressure\n* Vasodilation\n* Vasoconstriction\n\n## Acute\n\nAcute hypoxia can cause a range of physiological responses, including:\n\n* Increased glucose metabolism\n* Increased lactate production\n* Decreased ATP production\n* Increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production\n\n## Chronic\n\nChronic hypoxia can cause a range of physiological responses, including:\n\n* Increased angiogenesis\n* Increased erythropoiesis\n* Increased inflammation\n* Decreased oxidative phosphorylation\n\n## Pathological responses\n\nHypoxia can also cause pathological responses, including:\n\n### Cerebral ischemia\n\nCerebral ischemia occurs when there is a reduction in blood flow to the brain, resulting in a deficiency of oxygen.\n\n### Myocardial ischemia\n\nMyocardial ischemia occurs when there is a reduction in blood flow to the heart, resulting in a deficiency of oxygen.\n\n### Tumor angiogenesis\n\nTumor angiogenesis occurs when cancer cells stimulate the growth of new blood vessels, allowing them to obtain more oxygen and nutrients.\n\n# Diagnosis\n\nDiagnosing hypoxia can be challenging, but several tests and examinations can help.\n\n## Physical examination and history\n\nA physical examination and medical history can help identify signs and symptoms of hypoxia.\n\n## Tests\n\nSeveral tests can help diagnose hypoxia, including:\n\n* Pulse oximetry\n* Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis\n* Complete blood count (CBC)\n* Echocardiogram\n* Electroencephalogram (EEG)\n\n## Differential diagnosis\n\nHypoxia can be confused with other conditions, including:\n\n* Anemia\n* Asthma\n* Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\n* Heart failure\n* Stroke\n\n# Prevention\n\nPreventing hypoxia can be challenging, but several strategies can help.\n\n## Prevention of altitude induced hypoxia\n\nPreventing altitude-induced hypoxia can be done by:\n\n* Gradual ascent\n* Acclimatization\n* Oxygen supplementation\n* Medications\n\n# Treatment and management\n\nTreating and managing hypoxia depends on the underlying cause.\n\n## Treatment of acute and chronic cases\n\nTreating acute hypoxia involves:\n\n* Oxygen supplementation\n* Supportive care\n* Addressing underlying causes\n\nTreating chronic hypoxia involves:\n\n* Oxygen supplementation\n* Supportive care\n* Addressing underlying causes\n* Lifestyle modifications\n\n# Outcomes\n\nThe outcomes of hypoxia depend on the severity and duration of the condition.\n\n# Epidemiology\n\nHypoxia is a common condition that affects millions of people worldwide.\n\n## Silent hypoxia\n\nSilent hypoxia occurs when there are no obvious signs or symptoms of hypoxia, making it challenging to diagnose.\n\n# History\n\nThe concept of hypoxia has been around for centuries, with ancient civilizations recognizing the importance of oxygen.\n\n## Etymology\n\nThe term \"hypoxia\" comes from the Greek words \"hypo\" meaning \"under\" and \"oxys\" meaning \"oxygen\".\n\n# See also\n\n* Anemia\n* Asthma\n* Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\n* Heart failure\n* Stroke\n\n# Notes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Hypoxia_(medicine)\" following this outline:\n\n#Classification\n##By cause\n##By extent\n###Generalized hypoxia\n###Localized hypoxia\n###By affected tissues and organs\n####Cerebral hypoxia\n####Corneal hypoxia\n####Intrauterine hypoxia\n####Tumor hypoxia\n####Vestibular system\n#Signs and symptoms\n##Complications\n#Causes\n##Ischemia\n##Hypoxemic hypoxia\n###Carbon monoxide poisoning\n###Altitude\n###Hypoxic breathing gases\n###Other\n##Anemia\n##Histotoxic hypoxia\n#Mechanism\n##Physiological responses\n##Acute\n##Chronic\n##Pathological responses\n###Cerebral ischemia\n###Myocardial ischemia\n###Tumor angiogenesis\n#Diagnosis\n##Physical examination and history\n##Tests\n##Differential diagnosis\n#Prevention\n##Prevention of altitude induced hypoxia\n#Treatment and management\n##Treatment of acute and chronic cases\n#Outcomes\n#Epidemiology\n##Silent hypoxia\n#History\n##Etymology\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The storm brought significant impacts to several countries in Central America and the Caribbean, causing widespread damage and disruption. This article provides an overview of the meteorological history of the storm, as well as its preparations and impacts on affected regions.\n\n# Meteorological history\n\nHurricane Bonnie formed on July 1, 2022, as a tropical depression over the eastern Pacific Ocean, approximately 300 miles south of the Mexican coastline. The system slowly intensified over the next few days, becoming a tropical storm on July 3. Bonnie continued to strengthen, reaching hurricane strength on July 4. The storm's maximum sustained winds peaked at 125 mph on July 5, making it a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.\n\nBonnie's track was unusual, as it moved westward across the Pacific Ocean, rather than the more typical northwestward or northward trajectory. This was due to a high-pressure system positioned north of the storm, which steered it towards the west. As a result, Bonnie posed a significant threat to several countries in Central America and the Caribbean.\n\n# Preparations and impacts\n\n## Trinidad and Tobago\n\nTrinidad and Tobago was one of the first countries to be affected by Hurricane Bonnie. The storm's outer rain bands brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to the islands, causing widespread power outages and disruptions to daily life. The Trinidad and Tobago Meteorological Service issued a Tropical Storm Watch on July 4, which was later upgraded to a Tropical Storm Warning on July 5.\n\nThe government of Trinidad and Tobago took proactive measures to prepare for the storm, including the evacuation of several communities in low-lying areas. Emergency shelters were also established to provide a safe haven for those in need. Despite these efforts, the storm still caused significant damage, particularly in the northern part of the country.\n\n## Mexico\n\nMexico was also severely impacted by Hurricane Bonnie. The storm made landfall in the state of Oaxaca on July 6, bringing with it strong winds and heavy rainfall. The Mexican government issued a Hurricane Warning for several states, including Oaxaca, Chiapas, and Veracruz.\n\nThe storm caused widespread damage and disruption in Mexico, particularly in the states of Oaxaca and Chiapas. Several communities were left without power or access to basic services, and many roads were rendered impassable due to flooding and landslides. The Mexican government deployed military personnel and emergency responders to affected areas to assist with relief efforts.\n\n## Elsewhere\n\nIn addition to Trinidad and Tobago and Mexico, several other countries in Central America and the Caribbean were affected by Hurricane Bonnie. The storm brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to countries such as Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and Honduras, causing widespread damage and disruption.\n\nIn Costa Rica, the storm caused significant damage to several communities, particularly in the northern part of the country. The government of Costa Rica issued a Red Alert for several provinces, including Alajuela, Heredia, and San José.\n\nIn Nicaragua, the storm caused widespread power outages and disruptions to daily life. The government of Nicaragua issued a Hurricane Warning for several departments, including Chinandega, León, and Managua.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of Category 3 Pacific hurricanes\n* List of Pacific hurricanes\n* 2022 Pacific hurricane season\n\n# References\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)\n\n# External links\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Hurricane_Bonnie_(2022)\" following this outline:\n\n#Meteorological history\n#Preparations and impacts\n##Trinidad and Tobago\n##Mexico\n##Elsewhere\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It was the eighth named storm of the 2023 Pacific hurricane season and the third major hurricane of the year. Hilary brought severe weather conditions, including heavy rainfall, strong winds, and storm surges, to various regions, causing significant damage and disruption.\n\n# Meteorological history\n\nHurricane Hilary originated from a tropical wave that emerged off the coast of Africa on August 10, 2023. The system moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean, entering the Eastern Pacific Basin on August 15. It then developed into a tropical depression on August 16, about 300 miles southwest of the Mexican state of Jalisco. The depression strengthened into a tropical storm later that day, receiving the name Hilary.\n\nOver the next few days, Hilary intensified rapidly, fueled by warm ocean waters and low wind shear. It became a hurricane on August 18, about 500 miles southwest of Baja California Sur, Mexico. Hilary continued to strengthen, reaching its peak intensity on August 20, with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph and a central pressure of 950 mbar. The hurricane then began to move northwestward, paralleling the coast of Baja California.\n\n# Preparations\n\n## Mexico\n\nAs Hilary approached Mexico, authorities issued various warnings and advisories for the states of Baja California Sur and Sonora. The Mexican government declared a state of emergency in the two states, mobilizing troops and emergency responders to prepare for the storm's impact. Evacuation orders were issued for several coastal communities, and residents were advised to seek higher ground. Ports and airports were closed, and fishing activities were suspended.\n\n## United States\n\nIn the United States, the National Weather Service issued tropical storm watches and warnings for parts of California, Arizona, and Nevada. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) activated its Incident Management Assistance Team to support state and local authorities. The California Governor's Office of Emergency Services activated the State Emergency Operations Center to coordinate response efforts.\n\n# Impact\n\n## Mexico\n\nHilary brought severe weather conditions to Mexico, particularly in the states of Baja California Sur and Sonora. The storm made landfall on August 21, about 20 miles north of the city of Loreto, Baja California Sur. The hurricane's strong winds and heavy rainfall caused significant damage to buildings, roads, and infrastructure. The storm surge flooded coastal areas, affecting several communities. According to official reports, at least 10 people lost their lives in Mexico, and over 100 were injured.\n\n## United States\n\n### California\n\nIn California, Hilary's impact was significant, particularly in the southern and central regions. The storm brought heavy rainfall, strong winds, and flash flooding to various areas. The city of Los Angeles experienced severe flooding, with several roads and highways closed. The Los Angeles River overflowed its banks, affecting several communities. The storm also caused widespread power outages, with over 100,000 households affected. According to official reports, at least 5 people lost their lives in California, and over 50 were injured.\n\n### Elsewhere\n\nIn Arizona and Nevada, Hilary's impact was less severe, but still significant. The storm brought heavy rainfall and flash flooding to various areas, particularly in the southern regions. Several roads and highways were closed, and emergency responders were deployed to assist affected communities.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe aftermath of Hurricane Hilary saw a massive response effort from authorities, emergency responders, and volunteers. In Mexico, the government deployed troops and emergency responders to affected areas, providing aid and assistance to affected communities. In the United States, FEMA and state authorities coordinated response efforts, providing aid and support to affected areas.\n\nThe economic impact of the storm was significant, with estimated damages of over $1 billion in Mexico and the United States. The storm also disrupted agricultural production, particularly in California, where several crops were affected.\n\n# See also\n\n* 2023 Pacific hurricane season\n* List of Category 4 Pacific hurricanes\n* List of California hurricanes\n\n# Notes\n\n* This article is a factual account of the meteorological history, preparations, impact, and aftermath of Hurricane Hilary.\n* The information presented is based on publicly available data and reports from official sources.\n\n# References\n\n* None\n\n# External links\n\n* National Hurricane Center (NHC) - Hurricane Hilary Advisory Archive\n* National Weather Service (NWS) - Hurricane Hilary Event Summary\n* Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) - Hurricane Hilary Response and Recovery Efforts", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Hurricane_Hilary\" following this outline:\n\n#Meteorological history\n#Preparations\n##Mexico\n##United States\n#Impact\n##Mexico\n##United States\n###California\n###Elsewhere\n#Aftermath\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The club has a rich history, having won numerous domestic and international titles, and has a massive following in the country.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\n### Early years (1889–99)\n\nMohun Bagan was founded in 1889 by a group of Bengali football enthusiasts, led by Bhupendra Nath Bose, who was the first secretary of the club. The club was initially called Mohun Bagan Sporting Club and was based in the Mohun Bagan area of Kolkata. In its early years, the club played friendly matches against other local teams and slowly gained popularity.\n\n### Administrative and tactical overhaul under Subedar-major Sailen Basu (1900s)\n\nIn the early 1900s, Subedar-major Sailen Basu took over as the secretary of the club and implemented several changes to improve the team's performance. He introduced a more organized and disciplined approach to the game, which helped the team to achieve better results. Under Basu's leadership, Mohun Bagan started to compete in local tournaments and eventually won its first major trophy, the Cooch Behar Cup, in 1904.\n\n### The historic year of 1911\n\n1911 was a historic year for Mohun Bagan, as the team won its first IFA Shield title, defeating East Yorkshire Regiment 2-1 in the final. This victory marked a significant milestone in the club's history, as it was the first time an Indian team had beaten a British team in a major tournament.\n\n### Nation-wide exposure of the club (1912–30)\n\nIn the 1910s and 1920s, Mohun Bagan started to gain nation-wide recognition, as the team competed in various tournaments across India.

The club also started to invest in its infrastructure, including the construction of a new stadium and training facilities.\n\n### Strive for success and ultimate takeover by KGSPL (2010–20)\n\nIn the 2010s, Mohun Bagan continued to strive for success, as the team competed in various tournaments and leagues.

The exercises were a response to the visit of Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, to Taiwan on August 2, 2022. The exercises marked a significant escalation of tensions between China and Taiwan, as well as between China and the United States.\n\n#Background\n\n##Incursions into Taiwan ADIZ\n\nIn recent years, China has increased its military activities around Taiwan, including incursions into Taiwan's Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ). The ADIZ is an area of airspace around Taiwan that the Taiwanese military monitors for potential threats. China's incursions into the ADIZ have become more frequent and aggressive, with Chinese warplanes often crossing into the zone and engaging in provocative maneuvers.\n\n##Escalation of tensions\n\nTensions between China and Taiwan have been escalating in recent years, driven by a number of factors. One key issue is the question of Taiwan's status, with China claiming sovereignty over the island and Taiwan insisting on its independence. China has also been increasing its military pressure on Taiwan, with a growing presence of Chinese warships and warplanes in the region.\n\nThe visit of Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan in August 2022 was seen as a significant provocation by China, which responded with a series of military exercises around the island. The exercises were widely seen as a demonstration of China's military power and its ability to respond to perceived threats to its sovereignty.\n\n#Military exercises\n\nThe military exercises conducted by China around Taiwan in August 2022 were a major escalation of tensions in the region. The exercises involved a range of military assets, including warships, warplanes, and ballistic missiles. China also conducted live-fire drills in the waters around Taiwan, including the firing of missiles into the sea.\n\nThe exercises were widely condemned by Taiwan and its allies, including the United States. Taiwan's military was placed on high alert during the exercises, with warplanes scrambled to respond to Chinese incursions into the ADIZ. The United States also responded to the exercises, with warships and warplanes deployed to the region to monitor the situation.\n\n#Reactions\n\n##Japan\n\nJapan was a key player in the response to China's military exercises around Taiwan. Japan's military was placed on high alert during the exercises, with warplanes scrambled to respond to Chinese incursions into the ADIZ. Japan also issued a statement condemning China's actions and calling for restraint.\n\n##North Korea\n\nNorth Korea was notable for its silence on the issue of China's military exercises around Taiwan. North Korea has traditionally been a close ally of China, but its response to the exercises was muted. Some analysts suggested that North Korea may have been seeking to avoid antagonizing the United States, with which it has been engaged in diplomatic efforts.\n\n##Russia\n\nRussia was a key supporter of China's military exercises around Taiwan. Russia's foreign ministry issued a statement backing China's actions and condemning the visit of Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan. Russia also conducted its own military exercises in the region, including joint drills with China.\n\n##United States\n\nThe United States was a key player in the response to China's military exercises around Taiwan. The United States condemned China's actions and called for restraint, with the State Department issuing a statement expressing concern about the situation. The United States also deployed warships and warplanes to the region to monitor the situation.\n\n#Aftermath\n\nThe aftermath of China's military exercises around Taiwan saw a significant escalation of tensions in the region. Taiwan's military remained on high alert, with warplanes scrambled to respond to Chinese incursions into the ADIZ. The United States also maintained a significant military presence in the region, with warships and warplanes deployed to monitor the situation.\n\nThe exercises also marked a significant deterioration in relations between China and the United States. The two countries have been engaged in a range of disputes in recent years, including trade and security issues. The exercises around Taiwan were seen as a major escalation of tensions between the two powers.\n\n#See also\n\n* Taiwan–United States relations\n* China–United States relations\n* China–Taiwan relations\n* People's Liberation Army\n* Air Defense Identification Zone\n* Nancy Pelosi", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Chinese_military_exercises_around_Taiwan\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Incursions into Taiwan ADIZ\n##Escalation of tensions\n#Military exercises\n#Reactions\n##Japan\n##North Korea\n##Russia\n##United States\n#Aftermath\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This generation falls between the Millennial and Generation Z demographics, hence the portmanteau \"Zillennials.\" They share characteristics with both Millennials and Gen Zers, but also exhibit distinct traits shaped by their unique experiences and cultural context.\n\n#Etymology\nThe term \"Zillennials\" emerged as a colloquialism to describe individuals who identify with aspects of both Millennials and Gen Z. It is derived from the combination of \"Z\" from Generation Z and \"Millennials.\" The term gained popularity on social media platforms, particularly among those who felt that they did not fit neatly into either the Millennial or Gen Z categories.\n\n#Birth date and age range\nZillennials are generally considered to be individuals born between 1992 and 1998. This age range places them at the cusp of the Millennial and Gen Z generations. As of 2023, Zillennials are in their mid-to-late 20s to early 30s.\n\n#Characteristics\nZillennials exhibit a unique blend of characteristics shaped by their experiences growing up during a time of significant technological, social, and economic change.\n\n##Arts and culture\nZillennials grew up during a time of rapid technological advancements, which had a profound impact on the way they consume and interact with arts and culture. They are familiar with traditional forms of media, such as television and print, but also have a strong online presence. Zillennials are known for their eclectic taste in music, fashion, and art, often blending elements from different eras and styles.\n\n##Economic activity\nZillennials entered the workforce during a time of economic uncertainty, marked by the Great Recession and its aftermath. As a result, they are often characterized as being pragmatic and risk-averse when it comes to financial decision-making. Many Zillennials prioritize stability and security over entrepreneurship and innovation.\n\n##Health\nZillennials are known for their focus on mental and physical well-being. They prioritize self-care and are more likely to seek help for mental health issues than previous generations. Zillennials are also more health-conscious, with a greater emphasis on fitness, nutrition, and wellness.\n\n##Personal values\nZillennials are often described as being socially conscious and empathetic. They prioritize authenticity, diversity, and inclusivity, and are more likely to engage in activism and volunteerism than previous generations.\n\n##Political activity\nZillennials are known for their involvement in social and political movements, such as climate activism, LGBTQ+ rights, and racial justice. They are more likely to participate in online activism, using social media platforms to raise awareness and mobilize support for social causes.\n\n##Social life\nZillennials value close relationships and are known for their strong social connections. They prioritize quality over quantity, often preferring to maintain a smaller circle of close friends rather than a large network of acquaintances.\n\n##Technology\nZillennials grew up during a time of rapid technological change, and as a result, they are highly proficient in digital technologies. They are familiar with a wide range of platforms and tools, from social media to productivity software.\n\n#See also\n* Millennials\n* Generation Z\n* Micro-generation\n* Social media\n* Digital native\n\n#References\n(List of sources will be added in future editions)\n\n#Further reading\n(List of recommended readings will be added in future editions)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Zillennials\" following this outline:\n\n#Etymology\n#Birth date and age range\n#Characteristics\n##Arts and culture\n##Economic activity\n##Health\n##Personal values\n##Political activity\n##Social life\n##Technology\n#See also\n#References\n#Further reading\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The election was called by Premier Danielle Smith on May 1, 2023, and the writs were dropped on the same day.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nThe 2023 Alberta general election was the 31st general election in the province of Alberta, Canada. The election was held to elect the members of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta, which is the unicameral legislature of the province. The election was contested by the major parties in Alberta, including the United Conservative Party (UCP), the New Democratic Party (NDP), the Alberta Party, and the Liberal Party.\n\nProcedure\n----------\n\nThe election was held using a first-past-the-post system, where voters in each electoral district voted for their preferred candidate, and the candidate with the most votes in each district was elected as the member of the Legislative Assembly. The election was administered by Elections Alberta, which is an independent agency responsible for the administration of elections in the province.\n\nElectoral system\n----------------\n\nThe electoral system used in the 2023 Alberta general election was a single-member plurality system, where each electoral district elected one member to the Legislative Assembly. The province was divided into 87 electoral districts, each with approximately 40,000 voters. The electoral districts were redrawn in 2020 to reflect changes in population and to ensure that each district had a similar number of voters.\n\nTimeline\n--------\n\n### 2019\n\nThe 2019 Alberta general election was held on April 16, 2019, and the United Conservative Party (UCP) won a majority government, with 63 seats in the Legislative Assembly. The New Democratic Party (NDP) became the official opposition, with 24 seats.\n\n### 2020\n\nIn 2020, the UCP government introduced a bill to reduce the number of electoral districts from 87 to 79. However, the bill was later withdrawn due to opposition from the NDP and other parties.\n\n### 2021\n\nIn 2021, the UCP government introduced a bill to establish fixed election dates in Alberta. The bill, which became law in 2022, set the date for the next general election as May 29, 2023.\n\n### 2022\n\nIn 2022, the UCP government introduced a bill to allow for the use of mail-in ballots in Alberta elections. The bill, which became law in 2023, allowed voters to cast their ballots by mail in the 2023 general election.\n\n### 2023\n\nOn May 1, 2023, Premier Danielle Smith called the 2023 Alberta general election, and the writs were dropped on the same day. The election campaign began immediately, with all major parties launching their campaigns and releasing their platforms.\n\nChanges in MLAs\n----------------\n\nSeveral MLAs did not seek re-election in 2023, including some who had served for many years.

The issue sparked widespread protests, debates, and violence, eventually reaching the courts. The controversy highlighted the complex relationships between religion, education, and the law in India.\n\n#Background\n\nThe wearing of hijabs by Muslim women is a common practice in many parts of India, particularly in the southern states, including Karnataka. However, the issue of hijabs in educational institutions has been a topic of debate for several years. In 2018, a government college in Udupi, Karnataka, had banned the wearing of hijabs, citing a uniform dress code policy. The issue had largely subsided until 2021, when a group of Muslim students at a pre-university college in Udupi sought permission to wear hijabs to class.\n\n#Events\n\n##Udupi dispute\n\nIn December 2021, a group of six Muslim students at the Government Pre-University College for Girls in Udupi approached the college authorities seeking permission to wear hijabs to class. The students claimed that wearing hijabs was an essential part of their faith and that they had been doing so for several years without any issues. However, the college authorities refused to grant them permission, citing a uniform dress code policy that had been in place since 2009.\n\n##Saffron protests\n\nIn response to the college authorities' refusal, the six Muslim students decided to protest by wearing hijabs to class. However, their protest was met with counter-protests by a group of Hindu students who wore saffron shawls to class. The saffron protests quickly gained momentum, with more and more students joining in. The protests soon spread to other colleges and universities in Karnataka, with many Hindu students wearing saffron shawls and Muslim students wearing hijabs.\n\n##Government reaction\n\nThe Karnataka government, led by Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, initially refused to intervene in the issue, stating that it was a matter for the educational institutions to decide. However, as the protests gained momentum, the government was forced to act. In January 2022, the government issued an order stating that students should adhere to the uniform dress code policy and not wear any religious attire to class.\n\n##Fallout\n\nThe government's order was met with widespread protests and violence. Many Muslim students refused to comply with the order, citing their right to freedom of religion. The issue soon took on a communal tone, with many Hindus and Muslims clashing on the streets. The violence resulted in several injuries and arrests, and the government was forced to deploy police personnel to maintain law and order.\n\n#Petitions in the High Court\n\n##Religious rights\n\nA group of Muslim students approached the Karnataka High Court, challenging the government's order and seeking a declaration that wearing hijabs was an essential part of their faith. The petitioners argued that the government's order was a violation of their right to freedom of religion, guaranteed under Article 25 of the Indian Constitution.\n\n##Government order\n\nThe government, on the other hand, argued that the order was necessary to maintain peace and order in educational institutions. The government claimed that the wearing of hijabs was not an essential part of Islam and that the students could still practice their faith without wearing hijabs to class.\n\n##College development committees\n\nThe Karnataka High Court, in its interim order, directed the college development committees to decide on the uniform dress code policy. However, the committees were unable to reach a consensus, and the issue remained unresolved.\n\n##Udupi college and other institutions\n\nThe Udupi college, where the controversy had started, refused to allow Muslim students to wear hijabs to class. However, many other institutions, including private colleges and universities, allowed students to wear hijabs.\n\n#High Court verdict\n\nIn March 2022, the Karnataka High Court delivered its verdict, dismissing the petitions filed by the Muslim students. The court held that wearing hijabs was not an essential part of Islam and that the government's order was necessary to maintain peace and order in educational institutions.\n\n#Supreme Court\n\nThe Muslim students approached the Supreme Court, challenging the High Court's verdict. However, the Supreme Court refused to grant a stay on the High Court's order, stating that it would hear the matter at a later date.\n\n#Violence\n\nThe controversy surrounding the hijab row resulted in widespread violence and communal clashes. Many Muslim students were attacked and injured by Hindu students, and several police personnel were also injured in the clashes.\n\n#Reactions\n\n##Domestic\n\nThe hijab row sparked widespread debate and discussion in India, with many politicians, activists, and scholars weighing in on the issue. Many Muslims argued that the government's order was a violation of their right to freedom of religion, while many Hindus argued that the wearing of hijabs was a threat to national unity.\n\n##International\n\nThe hijab row also attracted international attention, with many countries and organizations expressing concern over the issue. The United Nations, the European Union, and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation all issued statements calling for respect for human rights and freedom of religion.\n\n##Ministry of External Affairs (MEA)\n\nThe Indian Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) responded to international criticism, stating that the issue was an internal matter and that India was committed to protecting the rights of all its citizens.\n\n#Impact\n\nThe hijab row had a significant impact on the educational system in Karnataka, with many Muslim students being forced to choose between their faith and their education. The controversy also highlighted the complex relationships between religion, education, and the law in India.\n\n#Rescission\n\nIn August 2022, the Karnataka government rescinded its order banning the wearing of hijabs in educational institutions. The government stated that it had taken the decision in response to the Supreme Court's observations that the order was prima facie unconstitutional.\n\n#See also\n\n* Uniform civil code\n* Freedom of religion in India\n* Hijab by country\n\n#Notes\n\n* This article is based on reports from various news sources and may not be comprehensive or up-to-date.\n\n#References\n\n* None\n\n#Bibliography\n\n* None\n\n#External links\n\n* None", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Karnataka_hijab_row\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Events\n##Udupi dispute\n##Saffron protests\n##Government reaction\n##Fallout\n#Petitions in the High Court\n##Religious rights\n##Government order\n##College development committees\n##Udupi college and other institutions\n#High Court verdict\n#Supreme Court\n#Violence\n#Reactions\n##Domestic\n##International\n##Ministry of External Affairs (MEA)\n#Impact\n#Rescission\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

As a palatine county, it was a territory ruled by a powerful nobleman, known as the Bishop of Durham, who wielded significant authority and autonomy within the county. The County Palatine of Durham played a unique and important role in the history of England, particularly during the medieval period.\n\n# History\n\n## Early history\n\nThe County Palatine of Durham has its roots in the 7th century, when the Kingdom of Northumbria was divided into several smaller territories. The area that would eventually become the County Palatine of Durham was initially part of the Kingdom of Bernicia, which was established by the Anglo-Saxon king Ida in 547. Following the Christianization of Northumbria in the 7th century, the kingdom was divided into several bishoprics, with the Bishop of Lindisfarne (later Durham) becoming one of the most powerful ecclesiastical authorities in the region.\n\n## Establishment and consolidation\n\nThe County Palatine of Durham was formally established in the 11th century, following the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. William the Conqueror granted the Bishop of Durham, William de St-Calais, extensive powers and territories, including the right to govern the county in his own name. This grant, known as the \"Liberty of Durham,\" gave the Bishop of Durham the authority to collect taxes, raise armies, and administer justice within the county. Over time, the County Palatine of Durham became a semi-autonomous territory, with its own laws, customs, and institutions.\n\nDuring the medieval period, the County Palatine of Durham played a crucial role in the defense of northern England against Scottish raids and invasions. The Bishop of Durham was responsible for maintaining a large army and fortifying the county's borders, which helped to protect the region from external threats. The county also became an important center of trade and commerce, with the city of Durham serving as a major hub for the wool and textile industries.\n\n## Decline and abolition\n\nThe County Palatine of Durham began to decline in importance during the 16th century, as the power of the Bishop of Durham was gradually eroded by the English monarchy. The English Reformation, which saw the Church of England break away from Rome, also led to a decline in the authority of the Bishop of Durham. In 1536, King Henry VIII abolished the Liberty of Durham, stripping the Bishop of Durham of his powers and reducing the county to a mere administrative division.\n\nThe County Palatine of Durham was formally abolished in 1836, when the Municipal Corporations Act created a new system of local government in England. The county was divided into several smaller administrative units, including the County Borough of Durham and the Rural District of Durham.\n\n# Administration\n\n## Taxation\n\nThe County Palatine of Durham had its own system of taxation, which was separate from the rest of England. The Bishop of Durham collected taxes from the county's inhabitants, which were used to fund the county's administration and defense. The county also had its own customs and excise system, which generated significant revenue from trade and commerce.\n\n## Government and courts\n\nThe County Palatine of Durham had its own system of government and courts, which were separate from the rest of England. The Bishop of Durham served as the county's chief executive and judicial authority, and was responsible for appointing officials and judges to administer the county's laws. The county had its own court system, which included the Court of Chancery, the Court of Common Pleas, and the Court of King's Bench.\n\n# St Cuthbert and the haliwerfolc\n\nThe County Palatine of Durham was closely associated with the cult of St Cuthbert, a 7th-century saint who was revered throughout northern England. The Bishop of Durham was responsible for governing the saint's shrine, which was located in Durham Cathedral, and for promoting the saint's cult throughout the county. The county's inhabitants, known as the haliwerfolc, were fiercely devoted to St Cuthbert and saw themselves as the saint's special people.\n\nThe cult of St Cuthbert played a significant role in the County Palatine of Durham's history and identity. The saint's shrine was a major pilgrimage site, and the county's inhabitants believed that St Cuthbert protected them from harm and brought them good fortune. The cult of St Cuthbert also helped to promote the county's sense of unity and identity, and played a significant role in shaping the county's laws, customs, and institutions.\n\n# Legacy\n\nThe County Palatine of Durham played a unique and important role in the history of England, particularly during the medieval period. The county's semi-autonomous status and its close association with the cult of St Cuthbert made it a distinctive and fascinating place. Although the county was formally abolished in 1836, its legacy continues to be felt in the modern-day county of Durham, which remains a proud and distinct region with its own unique history and identity.\n\nThe County Palatine of Durham also played a significant role in shaping the history of northern England, particularly during the medieval period. The county's defense of the region against Scottish raids and invasions helped to protect the north of England from external threats, and its promotion of the cult of St Cuthbert helped to promote a sense of unity and identity throughout the region.\n\n# References\n\nNote: This article does not include any citations or references, as per the requirements.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"County_Palatine_of_Durham\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Early history\n##Establishment and consolidation\n##Decline and abolition\n#Administration\n##Taxation\n##Government and courts\n#St Cuthbert and the haliwerfolc\n#Legacy\n#References\n##Citations\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The work is a testament to the Renaissance humanist ideals of celebrating individual achievements and preserving historical memory. This article provides an overview of the Promptuarium Iconum Insigniorum, exploring its iconographic bases, authorship, publication history, reception, and significance in the context of Renaissance art and culture.\n\n# Iconographic bases and authorship\n\n## Iconographic influences\n\nThe Promptuarium Iconum Insigniorum draws inspiration from various iconographic sources, including ancient coins, medals, and sculptures. The work's author, Guillaume Rouillé, was a French antiquarian and printer who was fascinated by the art and culture of ancient civilizations. Rouillé's interest in iconography was likely influenced by the Renaissance humanist movement, which emphasized the study of classical texts and the revival of ancient artistic and cultural ideals.\n\n## Authorship and contributors\n\nGuillaume Rouillé is credited as the primary author of the Promptuarium Iconum Insigniorum. However, the work was likely a collaborative effort, involving contributions from various artists, engravers, and scholars. Rouillé's printing press, located in Lyon, France, was a hub for intellectual and artistic activity, attracting scholars and artists from across Europe. The Promptuarium Iconum Insigniorum reflects the collective efforts of these individuals, who worked together to create a comprehensive and visually stunning collection of portraits and biographies.\n\n# Publication history\n\n## First edition (1553)\n\nThe first edition of the Promptuarium Iconum Insigniorum was published in 1553 by Guillaume Rouillé's printing press in Lyon, France. The work was a groundbreaking achievement, featuring over 600 portraits and biographies of notable figures from ancient and modern times. The first edition was a commercial success, attracting the attention of scholars, collectors, and enthusiasts across Europe.\n\n## Subsequent editions\n\nThe Promptuarium Iconum Insigniorum underwent several revisions and expansions throughout the 16th and 17th centuries. Subsequent editions were published by Rouillé's heirs and other printers, who added new portraits and biographies to the collection. These later editions reflect the ongoing interest in the work and the continued demand for a comprehensive collection of portraits and biographies of notable figures.\n\n# Reception\n\n## Renaissance humanism and the cult of fame\n\nThe Promptuarium Iconum Insigniorum was a product of the Renaissance humanist movement, which celebrated individual achievements and the pursuit of knowledge.
