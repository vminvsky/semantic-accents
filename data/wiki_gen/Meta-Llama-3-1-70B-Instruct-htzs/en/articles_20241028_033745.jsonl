He developed a range of innovative devices, including airships and dirigibles, and even designed a system for navigating airships using gyroscopes.\n\n##Radio control: the Telekino\n\nIn 1903, Torres Quevedo developed the Telekino, a system for controlling machines remotely using radio signals. The Telekino was a pioneering achievement in the field of robotics, and laid the foundation for modern radio control systems.\n\n##Formal language\n\nTorres Quevedo was also interested in the development of formal languages, which are used to describe the syntax and semantics of programming languages. He developed a range of formal languages, including one that was used to describe the behavior of his analogue calculating machines.\n\n##Laboratory of Automation\n\nIn 1912, Torres Quevedo established the Laboratory of Automation in Madrid, which became a hub for research and development in automation and robotics. The laboratory was equipped with a range of innovative devices, including robots, automated machines, and analogue calculating machines.\n\n##Chess automaton: El Ajedrecista\n\nIn 1912, Torres Quevedo developed El Ajedrecista, a chess-playing automaton that could play a game of chess against a human opponent. El Ajedrecista was a pioneering achievement in the field of artificial intelligence, and demonstrated the potential of machines to perform complex tasks.\n\n##Essays on Automatics\n\nTorres Quevedo wrote a range of essays on automatics, which were published in various journals and books. His essays covered topics such as the history of automation, the development of analogue calculating machines, and the potential applications of automation in industry and society.\n\n###Analytical machines\n\nTorres Quevedo was particularly interested in the development of analytical machines, which were designed to perform complex mathematical calculations. He developed a range of analytical machines, including ones that could solve differential equations and perform arithmetic operations.\n\n##Naval projects\n\nTorres Quevedo also worked on various naval projects, including the design and construction of submarines and torpedoes. He developed a range of innovative solutions to the technical challenges involved, including the use of gyroscopes and radio control systems.\n\n##Other inventions and miscellaneous activities\n\nTorres Quevedo was a prolific inventor and developed a range of other innovative devices and systems, including a machine that could transmit images over wires, a system for navigating ships using gyroscopes, and a range of medical devices.\n\n###Esperantist\n\nTorres Quevedo was also an Esperantist, and believed that the Esperanto language could be used as a universal language for international communication. He wrote several articles and books on Esperanto, and even developed a range of Esperanto-language teaching materials.\n\n###Spanish-American Technological Dictionary\n\nTorres Quevedo also compiled the Spanish-American Technological Dictionary, which was a comprehensive dictionary of technical terms used in industry and engineering.\n\n#Distinctions\n\nTorres Quevedo received a range of distinctions and awards for his contributions to science and technology. He was elected to the Spanish Royal Academy of Sciences in 1901, and received the Grand Cross of the Order of Isabella the Catholic in 1920.\n\n#Personal life, religious beliefs and death\n\nTorres Quevedo was a devout Catholic, and believed that his work in science and technology was a way of serving God. He was married to Maria de los Ángeles González, and had five children. He died on December 18, 1936, at the age of 83, and was buried in the Cementerio de la Almudena in Madrid.\n\n#Legacy\n\nTorres Quevedo's legacy is a testament to his innovative spirit and his contributions to science and technology. He is remembered as one of the pioneers of modern robotics and artificial intelligence, and his work continues to inspire new generations of scientists and engineers.\n\n#In fiction\n\nTorres Quevedo has been the subject of several works of fiction, including a novel by the Spanish author, Javier Benet. The novel, \" Torres Quevedo: El inventor de la era moderna\", tells the story of Torres Quevedo's life and work, and explores the themes of science, technology, and innovation.\n\n#Selected works\n\n* \"Essays on Automatics\" (1912)\n* \"The Analytical Machine\" (1915)\n* \"The Telekino: A System for Controlling Machines Remotely\" (1903)\n* \"El Ajedrecista: A Chess-Playing Automaton\" (1912)\n* \"The Spanish-American Technological Dictionary\" (1920)\n\n#See also\n\n* Robotics\n* Artificial intelligence\n* Analogue computing\n* Automation\n* Esperanto\n\n#References\n\n##Notes\n\n##Bibliography\n\n#External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Leonardo_Torres_Quevedo\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and education\n#Career\n##Cableways\n##Analogue calculating machines\n##Aerostatics\n##Radio control: the Telekino\n##Formal language\n##Laboratory of Automation\n##Chess automaton: El Ajedrecista\n##Essays on Automatics\n###Analytical machines\n##Naval projects\n##Other inventions and miscellaneous activities\n###Esperantist\n###Spanish-American Technological Dictionary\n#Distinctions\n#Personal life, religious beliefs and death\n#Legacy\n#In fiction\n#Selected works\n#See also\n#References\n##Notes\n##Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The valley is surrounded by the Himalayan mountain range, with steep cliffs and deep gorges. The terrain is rugged, with rocky outcrops, snow-capped peaks, and alpine meadows. The valley floor is narrow, with a few villages and hamlets scattered along the riverbanks.\n\nThe economy of the Aryan Valley is primarily based on agriculture and animal husbandry. The region is known for its high-quality wool, which is obtained from the local sheep and goats. The valley is also home to a variety of crops, including barley, wheat, and potatoes. The region's harsh climate and limited connectivity make it difficult to access markets and sell products, resulting in a relatively subsistence-based economy.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\nThe Aryan Valley has a rich and diverse history, with various cultures and empires vying for control over the region. The valley has been inhabited by the Brokpa community, an indigenous tribe with a unique culture and language.\n\n### Brokpas\n\nThe Brokpas are an ancient tribe that inhabits the Aryan Valley. They are believed to be the descendants of the Dard people, who lived in the region thousands of years ago. The Brokpas have a unique culture, language, and customs, which are distinct from the rest of the Indian subcontinent. They are predominantly Buddhist, with a strong emphasis on Tibetan Buddhism.\n\nThe Brokpas have a rich tradition of storytelling, music, and dance. They are skilled craftsmen, known for their expertise in woolen products, such as shawls, hats, and socks. The Brokpas are also expert farmers, with a deep understanding of the local soil and climate.\n\n### Aryan Association and Neologism\n\nIn recent years, the term \"Aryan\" has been associated with the valley, leading to a neologism that has sparked controversy and debate. The term \"Aryan\" is derived from the Sanskrit word \"arya,\" meaning \"noble\" or \"exalted.\" The term has been used to describe the Indo-European people who migrated to the Indian subcontinent thousands of years ago.\n\nHowever, the association of the term \"Aryan\" with the valley is a relatively recent phenomenon, dating back to the early 20th century. Some scholars argue that the term was used to describe the valley's unique cultural and linguistic heritage, while others argue that it was used to promote a nationalist and racial agenda.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the term \"Aryan\" has led to a reevaluation of the valley's history and cultural identity. Many scholars argue that the term is a misnomer, and that the valley's unique culture and language are better described by the term \"Brokpa.\"\n\nSee Also\n--------\n\n* Kargil district\n* Jammu and Kashmir\n* Himalayas\n* Tibetan Buddhism\n* Brokpa language\n* Dard people\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nThe Aryan Valley is a relatively remote and inaccessible region, with limited connectivity to the rest of the world. The valley is surrounded by the Himalayan mountain range, with steep cliffs and deep gorges. The terrain is rugged, with rocky outcrops, snow-capped peaks, and alpine meadows.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n(This section is intentionally left blank)\n\nBibliography\n------------\n\n(This section is intentionally left blank)\n\nExternal Links\n---------------\n\n(This section is intentionally left blank)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Aryan_Valley\" following this outline:\n\n#Geography and economy\n#History\n##Brokpas\n##Aryan association and neologism\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

His father was a Buddhist priest, and his mother was a homemaker. Tsuburaya's early life was marked by a love of animals and the outdoors, which would later influence his filmmaking style. He attended local schools and developed an interest in photography and filmmaking.\n\n### Early career and marriage (1919–1934)\n\nIn 1919, Tsuburaya moved to Tokyo to pursue a career in filmmaking. He began working as a cinematographer's assistant at the Nikkatsu film studio, where he met his future wife, Masano Araki.

The monastery is situated on a hill overlooking the Dnieper River and is one of the city's most iconic landmarks. The monastery has a rich history dating back to the 12th century and has played a significant role in the development of Ukrainian culture and spirituality.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\n### Early years\n\nThe monastery was founded in 1108-1113 by Sviatopolk II Iziaslavich, the Grand Prince of Kiev, who built the first wooden church on the site. The church was dedicated to the Archangel Michael, the patron saint of Kiev. The monastery quickly gained prominence as a center of learning, art, and spirituality, attracting monks and pilgrims from all over Eastern Europe.\n\n### 16th–17th centuries\n\nDuring the 16th and 17th centuries, the monastery underwent significant transformations. In 1496, the monastery was rebuilt in stone, and the iconic golden domes were added to the church. The monastery became a major center of Ukrainian Orthodox culture, producing many prominent scholars, artists, and theologians. The monastery's scriptorium was renowned for its illuminated manuscripts, and its workshops produced intricate icons and frescoes.\n\n### 18th century\n\nIn the 18th century, the monastery experienced a period of decline, due in part to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth's attempts to suppress Ukrainian culture. However, the monastery continued to play an important role in Ukrainian society, serving as a center of education and a symbol of national identity.\n\n### 19th century\n\nDuring the 19th century, the monastery underwent significant restoration work, including the rebuilding of the church's golden domes. The monastery also became a major center of Ukrainian nationalism, with many prominent writers, artists, and politicians drawn to its cultural and spiritual significance.\n\n### 20th century\n\nIn the early 20th century, the monastery was nationalized by the Soviet government, and its monks were forced to flee or go into hiding. The monastery's buildings were converted into a museum, and many of its artworks and artifacts were sold or destroyed. In 1935, the Soviet government demolished the monastery's church, citing its \"decadent\" and \"reactionary\" architecture.\n\n### Demolition and aftermath\n\nThe demolition of the monastery's church was a devastating blow to Ukrainian culture and identity. Many of the monastery's artworks and artifacts were lost or destroyed, and the site was left abandoned and neglected. However, the monastery's legacy continued to inspire Ukrainian nationalists and dissidents, who saw it as a symbol of resistance against Soviet oppression.\n\n### Restoration\n\nIn the late 1980s, with the advent of glasnost and perestroika, the Ukrainian government began to restore the monastery. The restoration project was a massive undertaking, involving the rebuilding of the church, the refectory, and other buildings.\n\n#### Plans and preparatory work\n\nThe restoration project began with a thorough examination of the site and the remaining buildings. Archaeologists and historians worked to reconstruct the monastery's original layout and architecture, using historical records and surviving artifacts.\n\n#### Rebuilding the monastery\n\nThe rebuilding of the monastery began in the early 1990s, with the construction of the new church. The church was designed to replicate the original 11th-century structure, using traditional materials and techniques. The golden domes were rebuilt, and the interior was adorned with intricate frescoes and mosaics.\n\n#### Metropolitan see\n\nIn 1999, the monastery was designated as the metropolitan see of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate). The monastery's abbot, Metropolitan Onuphrius, was enthroned as the primate of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.\n\nArchitecture\n------------\n\n### Dates, styles and architects\n\nThe monastery's architecture reflects its complex and evolving history. The original 11th-century church was built in the Byzantine style, with a central dome and four smaller domes. The 16th-century rebuilding of the church introduced Renaissance elements, including the iconic golden domes. The 19th-century restoration work added Neoclassical elements, including the refectory's facade.\n\n### Cathedral (11th–20th century structure)\n\nThe original 11th-century church was a small, single-domed structure. Over the centuries, the church was expanded and modified, with the addition of new domes and chapels. The church's interior was adorned with intricate frescoes and mosaics, including a famous 12th-century mosaic of the Archangel Michael.\n\n### Rebuilt cathedral\n\nThe rebuilt cathedral is a faithful replica of the original 11th-century structure, with some modifications to accommodate modern needs. The church's exterior is adorned with intricate stone carvings and ornate metalwork.\n\n#### Exterior\n\nThe church's exterior is dominated by the five golden domes, which are topped with ornate metalwork and finials. The facade is adorned with intricate stone carvings, including a famous 19th-century relief of the Archangel Michael.\n\n#### Interior\n\nThe church's interior is adorned with intricate frescoes and mosaics, including a famous 12th-century mosaic of the Archangel Michael.

This phenomenon has occurred throughout history, often as a result of war, revolution, or regime change. In such cases, the embassy may continue to provide services to its citizens, engage in diplomatic activities, and even represent the interests of the defunct government.\n\n# History\n\n## Russia (1917–1925)\n\nThe Russian Revolution of 1917 led to the overthrow of the Romanov dynasty and the establishment of the Soviet Union. However, the diplomatic missions of the Russian Empire continued to operate abroad, albeit in a state of limbo.\n\n### Diplomatic missions after 1917\n\nFollowing the revolution, many Russian diplomats abroad refused to recognize the new Soviet government, instead opting to continue representing the interests of the deposed monarchy. This led to a situation where multiple Russian diplomatic missions coexisted, each claiming to represent the legitimate government of Russia. The Soviet government, meanwhile, established its own diplomatic missions, which gradually gained recognition from other countries.\n\nThe most notable example of an embassy without a government during this period was the Russian Embassy in Paris, which continued to operate under the auspices of the deposed monarchy. The embassy's staff, led by Ambassador Vasily Maklakov, refused to recognize the Soviet government and instead maintained ties with the Russian émigré community. The embassy's activities were tolerated by the French government, which saw it as a means of maintaining relations with the Russian people, even if not with the Soviet government.\n\n### Dissolution of the Soviet Union\n\nThe situation was eventually resolved with the establishment of formal diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and other countries. The Russian Embassy in Paris, along with other diplomatic missions representing the deposed monarchy, was gradually dismantled, and its staff either retired or defected to the Soviet government.\n\n## Spain (1939–1977)\n\nThe Spanish Civil War led to the establishment of a fascist dictatorship under General Francisco Franco, which lasted until his death in 1975. During this period, the Second Spanish Republic, which had been overthrown by Franco's forces, maintained a diplomatic mission in exile.\n\n### Diplomatic missions after 1939\n\nThe government-in-exile, led by President Manuel Azaña, established a network of diplomatic missions abroad, which continued to represent the interests of the deposed republic. These missions operated in a state of limbo, as they were not recognized by the Franco regime or by most other countries. Despite this, the missions continued to provide services to Spanish citizens abroad and engaged in diplomatic activities, including efforts to isolate the Franco regime.\n\nThe most notable example of an embassy without a government during this period was the Spanish Embassy in Mexico City, which served as the de facto capital of the government-in-exile. The embassy's staff, led by Ambassador Félix Gordón Ordás, maintained close ties with the Mexican government, which provided significant support to the Republican cause.\n\n## Poland (1939–1990)\n\nThe invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in 1939 led to the establishment of a Polish government-in-exile, which operated in London and later in Paris.\n\n### Diplomatic missions after 1939\n\nThe government-in-exile established a network of diplomatic missions abroad, which continued to represent the interests of Poland despite the absence of a recognized Polish government. These missions operated in a state of limbo, as they were not recognized by the occupying powers or by many other countries. Despite this, the missions continued to provide services to Polish citizens abroad and engaged in diplomatic activities, including efforts to secure support for the Polish resistance.\n\nThe most notable example of an embassy without a government during this period was the Polish Embassy in Washington, D.C., which served as a key center for Polish-American relations. The embassy's staff, led by Ambassador Jan Ciechanowski, maintained close ties with the U.S. government, which provided significant support to the Polish cause.\n\n## Afghanistan (2021–present)\n\nThe Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan in August 2021 led to the collapse of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, which had been established in 2001.\n\n### Diplomatic missions after 2021\n\nThe diplomatic missions of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan continued to operate abroad, despite the absence of a recognized government. These missions, including the Afghan Embassy in Washington, D.C., have maintained ties with the international community and continued to provide services to Afghan citizens abroad. However, the Taliban's takeover has led to a situation where multiple Afghan diplomatic missions coexist, each claiming to represent the legitimate government of Afghanistan.\n\nThe international community has been slow to recognize the Taliban's government, and many countries have instead maintained ties with the diplomatic missions of the deposed Islamic Republic. This has led to a situation where the Afghan Embassy in Washington, D.C., continues to operate under the auspices of the deposed government, even as the Taliban's government seeks to establish its own diplomatic presence abroad.\n\n# See also\n\n* Diplomatic recognition\n* Government-in-exile\n* Embassy\n\n# Notes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Embassy_without_a_government\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Russia (1917–1925)\n###Diplomatic missions after 1917\n###Dissolution of the Soviet Union\n##Spain (1939–1977)\n###Diplomatic missions after 1939\n##Poland (1939–1990)\n###Diplomatic missions after 1939\n##Afghanistan (2021–present)\n###Diplomatic missions after 2021\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

FTX was known for its innovative products, high liquidity, and celebrity endorsements, but its rapid growth and success ultimately led to a catastrophic crisis that sent shockwaves throughout the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\nFTX was founded in 2019 by Sam Bankman-Fried, a young entrepreneur and trader who had previously worked at Jane Street, a quantitative trading firm. Bankman-Fried, also known as SBF, had a vision to create a cryptocurrency exchange that would offer more advanced trading products and better liquidity than existing exchanges. He assembled a team of experienced traders and developers, and FTX quickly gained popularity among professional traders and institutions.\n\nIn 2020, FTX raised $8 million in funding from investors, including Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world. The investment helped FTX expand its operations and develop new products, including perpetual swaps and options. FTX also launched a series of high-profile partnerships with sports teams and celebrities, including the Miami Heat and the NFL's Tom Brady.\n\nNovember 2022 Crisis and Bankruptcy\n------------------------------------\n\n### Background: FTX and Alameda, Binance, and CoinDesk report\n\nIn November 2022, a series of events led to the collapse of FTX and its affiliated companies. On November 2, CoinDesk, a cryptocurrency news outlet, published a report that revealed close ties between FTX and Alameda Research, a trading firm also founded by Sam Bankman-Fried. The report raised concerns about the potential for conflicts of interest and the lack of transparency between the two companies.\n\n### Crisis begins: Binance FTT sale, sell-off, and withdrawn rescue bid\n\nOn November 6, Binance, FTX's largest investor, announced that it would sell its entire stake in FTX, citing concerns about the company's financial health. The news triggered a massive sell-off of FTX's native token, FTT, which lost over 70% of its value in a matter of hours. As FTT's price plummeted, FTX's liquidity crisis deepened, and the company's ability to meet its obligations to customers and creditors began to deteriorate.\n\nIn an effort to rescue FTX, Binance announced on November 8 that it would acquire the company, pending due diligence. However, just 24 hours later, Binance pulled out of the deal, citing concerns about FTX's financial condition and potential regulatory issues.\n\n### Bankruptcy and unauthorized transactions\n\nOn November 11, FTX filed for bankruptcy in the United States, along with its affiliated companies, including Alameda Research and FTX.us.

The siege, which lasted from February 24 to May 20, 2022, was one of the most intense and devastating battles of the conflict.\n\n#Background\n\nMariupol, a strategic port city in the Donetsk region of Ukraine, had been a major industrial and cultural center in the country. With a pre-war population of over 450,000 people, it was a significant urban center and a key target for Russian forces seeking to capture Ukraine's coastline along the Sea of Azov.\n\nIn the months leading up to the invasion, tensions between Ukraine and Russia had escalated, with Russian forces massing along the border. Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, had warned of an impending attack, but the international community had struggled to respond effectively.\n\n#Advances to Mariupol\n\n##Preliminary shelling and advance on the city\n\nOn February 24, 2022, Russian forces launched a surprise invasion of Ukraine, with artillery and missile strikes hitting targets across the country. Mariupol was among the first cities to be shelled, with Russian forces seeking to soften up Ukrainian defenses before advancing on the city.\n\nOver the next several days, Russian forces made steady gains, pushing Ukrainian troops back towards Mariupol. The city's defenses were weakened by a series of intense artillery bombardments, which destroyed homes, businesses, and critical infrastructure.\n\n##Mariupol surrounded\n\nBy March 1, 2022, Russian forces had encircled Mariupol, cutting off the city's supply lines and trapping thousands of civilians inside. The city's defenders, a mix of Ukrainian army units, territorial defense forces, and volunteer militias, prepared for a prolonged siege.\n\n#Urban advances\n\n##Russian push into the city\n\nOn March 3, 2022, Russian forces launched a direct assault on Mariupol, pushing into the city's outskirts and sparking intense street fighting. Ukrainian defenders fought back, but Russian forces made steady gains, slowly pushing deeper into the city.\n\nAs the battle raged on, civilians were caught in the crossfire, with many trapped in their homes or forced to flee. The city's hospitals were quickly overwhelmed, with medical staff struggling to treat the wounded.\n\n##Final pockets of resistance\n\nBy mid-March, Russian forces had captured much of Mariupol, but Ukrainian defenders continued to hold out in a few key areas. The city's defenders were vastly outnumbered and outgunned, but they refused to surrender.\n\n#Resistance in the Azovstal steel plant\n\n##Withdrawal to Azovstal\n\nAs Russian forces closed in, Ukrainian defenders withdrew to the Azovstal steel plant, a massive industrial complex that dominated the city's skyline. The plant, with its maze of tunnels, bunkers, and factories, became a fortress for the Ukrainian defenders.\n\n##Siege of Az", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Siege_of_Mariupol\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Advances to Mariupol\n##Preliminary shelling and advance on the city\n##Mariupol surrounded\n#Urban advances\n##Russian push into the city\n##Final pockets of resistance\n#Resistance in the Azovstal steel plant\n##Withdrawal to Azovstal\n##Siege of Azovstal\n##Evacuation of civilians\n##Ukrainian surrender\n#Aftermath\n##Demolition of buildings and Russification of the city\n##Last Ukrainian holdouts and prisoners of war\n##City government's role\n##Claimed cholera outbreak\n##Ukrainian missile strikes\n#Casualties\n##Military casualties\n##Civilian casualties\n#Humanitarian situation\n#War crimes committed by Russian forces\n##Shooting of evacuation checkpoints\n##Maternity and children's hospital bombing\n##Regional theatre bombing\n##Mass shelling of residential areas\n##Alleged use of chemical weapons\n#Media coverage\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He was a prominent figure in the Elizabethan era and played a significant role in the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588.\n\nBirth and Early Years\n---------------------\n\nFrancis Drake was born around 1540 in Tavistock, Devon, England, to Edmund Drake and his wife, Mary Mylwaye. He was the eldest of twelve children, and his family was of modest means. Drake's early life is not well-documented, but it is believed that he received a basic education and was raised as a Protestant.\n\nEarly Career at Sea\n-------------------\n\nDrake began his career at sea at a young age, working on ships that sailed to the Mediterranean and the coast of West Africa. In 1563, he joined his cousin, Sir John Hawkins, on a voyage to the West Indies, where they engaged in the slave trade.\n\n### Slave Trade\n\nDrake and Hawkins were involved in the slave trade, which was a lucrative business at the time. They transported enslaved Africans to the Spanish colonies in the Caribbean, where they were sold to plantation owners. However, Drake eventually became disillusioned with the slave trade and later spoke out against it.\n\n### Expedition of 1572–1573\n\nIn 1572, Drake set sail on an expedition to the West Indies with two ships, the Judith and the Mary. The expedition was a success, and Drake returned to England with a significant amount of treasure.\n\n### Rathlin Island Massacre\n\nIn 1575, Drake was involved in a massacre on Rathlin Island, off the coast of Ireland. Drake and his crew attacked the island, which was inhabited by a clan of Scottish-Irish Catholics, and killed many of the island's inhabitants.\n\nCircumnavigation (1577–1580)\n---------------------------\n\nIn 1577, Drake set sail on a voyage around the world with five ships and over 160 men. The voyage was a groundbreaking achievement and made Drake the first Englishman to circumnavigate the globe.\n\n### Execution of Thomas Doughty\n\nDuring the voyage, Drake had Thomas Doughty, one of his crew members, executed for mutiny. The execution was a controversial decision, and some of Drake's crew members later questioned its legitimacy.\n\n### Entering the Pacific (1578)\n\nIn 1578, Drake and his crew entered the Pacific Ocean through the Strait of Magellan at the tip of South America. They sailed up the coast of South America, raiding Spanish ships and towns along the way.\n\n### Raids on Spanish American West Coast\n\nDrake and his crew raided several Spanish towns on the west coast of South America, including Valparaíso and Callao. They also captured several Spanish ships, including the Nuestra Señora de la Victoria, which was a treasure galleon.\n\n### Coast of California: Nova Albion (1579)\n\nIn 1579, Drake and his crew landed on the coast of California, which they named Nova Albion. They claimed the land for England and set up a settlement, which they called Nova Albion.\n\n### Across the Pacific and Around Africa\n\nAfter leaving California, Drake and his crew sailed across the Pacific Ocean and around Africa, returning to England in 1580.\n\n### Return to Plymouth (1580)\n\nDrake returned to Plymouth, England, in 1580, where he was greeted as a hero. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth I and given a grant of land.\n\n### Knighthood and Arms\n\nDrake was knighted by Queen Elizabeth I in 1581, and he was given the coat of arms of a golden ship on a blue shield. The arms were a symbol of his naval achievements and his status as a knight.\n\nPolitical Career\n----------------\n\nDrake became involved in politics after his circumnavigation of the globe. He was elected as a member of parliament for Plymouth in 1581 and later became a close advisor to Queen Elizabeth I.\n\nGreat Expedition to America\n-------------------------\n\nIn 1585, Drake set sail on a great expedition to America, where he raided Spanish towns and ships. The expedition was a success, and Drake returned to England with a significant amount of treasure.\n\nConflict with the Spanish Armada\n-------------------------------\n\nDrake played a significant role in the conflict with the Spanish Armada in 1588. He was one of the leaders of the English fleet that defeated the Spanish Armada.\n\n### Cádiz Raid\n\nIn 1587, Drake led a raid on the Spanish port of Cádiz, where he destroyed several Spanish ships and disrupted the Spanish naval preparations.\n\n### Defeat of the Spanish Armada\n\nIn 1588, Drake was one of the leaders of the English fleet that defeated the Spanish Armada. The defeat of the Spanish Armada was a significant victory for England and marked the beginning of English naval supremacy.\n\n### English Armada\n\nIn 1589, Drake led the English Armada, a fleet of ships that sailed to Spain and Portugal to attack the Spanish naval bases. The expedition was a failure, and Drake was forced to return to England without achieving his objectives.\n\nDefeats and Death\n-----------------\n\nDrake's later years were marked by a series of defeats and failures. He was defeated by the Spanish in the West Indies in 1595 and died of dysentery on January 28, 1596, off the coast of Panama.\n\nFamily and Heritage\n------------------\n\nDrake was married twice, first to Mary Newman and then to Elizabeth Sydenham. He had no children, but his family continued to play a significant role in English naval history.\n\nLegacy and Honours\n------------------\n\nDrake's legacy is that of a great naval hero and explorer. He was the first Englishman to circumnavigate the globe and played a significant role in the defeat of the Spanish Armada.\n\n### Geographical Names\n\nDrake's name is commemorated in several geographical names, including Drake's Bay in California and Drake's Channel in the Caribbean.\n\nSee Also\n--------\n\n* English Armada\n* Spanish Armada\n* Circumnavigation\n* Privateering\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n* (Note: There are no references in this article)\n\nBibliography\n------------\n\n* (Note: There is no bibliography in this article)\n\nExternal Links\n---------------\n\n* (Note: There are no external links in this article)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Francis_Drake\" following this outline:\n\n#Birth and early years\n#Early career at sea\n##Slave trade\n##Expedition of 1572–1573\n##Rathlin Island massacre\n#Circumnavigation (1577–1580)\n##Execution of Thomas Doughty\n##Entering the Pacific (1578)\n##Raids on Spanish American west coast\n##Coast of California: Nova Albion (1579)\n##Across the Pacific and around Africa\n##Return to Plymouth (1580)\n##Knighthood and arms\n#Political career\n#Great Expedition to America\n#Conflict with the Spanish Armada\n##Cádiz raid\n##Defeat of the Spanish Armada\n##English Armada\n#Defeats and death\n#Family and heritage\n#Legacy and honours\n##Geographical names\n#See also\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

During his time in public office, Biden had access to classified information, which is sensitive information that is protected by law from unauthorized disclosure. Classified documents are typically handled and stored in secure facilities, and access is restricted to authorized personnel with a need-to-know clearance.\n\nAfter leaving office as Vice President, Biden established the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement at the University of Pennsylvania, where he served as the center's founding chair. The center was established to promote diplomacy and global engagement, and it was supported by a number of donors, including the University of Pennsylvania and foreign governments.\n\n# Discoveries and other developments\n\n## First batch of documents\n\nIn November 2022, Biden's attorneys discovered a batch of classified documents at the Penn Biden Center in Washington, D.C. The documents were found in a secure room, and they were reportedly related to Biden's time as Vice President. The discovery was made by Biden's attorneys, who were conducting a review of the center's files in preparation for the center's closure.\n\n## DOJ letter to Bob Bauer\n\nOn November 9, 2022, the Department of Justice (DOJ) sent a letter to Bob Bauer, a lawyer for Biden, requesting that the documents be turned over to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). The letter was sent by the DOJ's National Security Division, and it requested that the documents be returned to NARA by November 14, 2022.\n\n## Second batch of documents\n\nOn December 20, 2022, Biden's attorneys discovered a second batch of classified documents at Biden's home in Wilmington, Delaware. The documents were found in a storage room, and they were reportedly related to Biden's time as Vice President. The discovery was made by Biden's attorneys, who were conducting a review of Biden's files in response to the discovery of the first batch of documents.\n\n## FBI search of Biden's Wilmington home\n\nOn January 20, 2023, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) conducted a search of Biden's home in Wilmington, Delaware. The search was conducted in response to the discovery of the second batch of classified documents, and it was reportedly focused on finding any additional classified documents that may have been stored at the property. The search was carried out by FBI agents, who were accompanied by Biden's attorneys.\n\n## Other searches\n\nIn addition to the search of Biden's home in Wilmington, the FBI also conducted searches of other properties associated with Biden, including the Penn Biden Center in Washington, D.C. The searches were reportedly focused on finding any additional classified documents that may have been stored at the properties.\n\n# Initial responses\n\n## Biden and his legal team\n\nBiden and his legal team have maintained that the discovery of the classified documents was an honest mistake, and that they have fully cooperated with the DOJ and the FBI. In a statement, Biden said that he was \"surprised\" to learn that the documents had been found, and that he had not been aware that they were stored at the Penn Biden Center or his home in Wilmington.\n\n## Elected officials\n\n### Republican elected officials\n\nRepublican elected officials have been critical of Biden's handling of the classified documents, with some calling for his impeachment. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said that the discovery of the documents was \"unacceptable,\" and that Biden had \"compromised national security.\" Senator Ted Cruz said that the incident was \"a serious scandal,\" and that Biden had \"clearly broken the law.\"\n\n### Democratic elected officials\n\nDemocratic elected officials have been more supportive of Biden, with some saying that the discovery of the classified documents was an honest mistake. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said that the incident was \"a minor mistake,\" and that Biden had \"taken responsibility\" for it. Representative Adam Schiff said that the incident was \"not a scandal,\" and that Biden had \"fully cooperated\" with the DOJ and the FBI.\n\n## Media analysis\n\nMedia analysis of the incident has been mixed, with some outlets saying that it is a serious scandal, while others have downplayed its significance. The New York Times said that the incident was \"a serious lapse in judgment,\" while The Washington Post said that it was \"a minor mistake.\" Fox News has been highly critical of Biden, with some hosts saying that he should be impeached.\n\n## Misinformation\n\nThere has been some misinformation about the incident, with some outlets saying that Biden had intentionally stored the classified documents at the Penn Biden Center or his home in Wilmington. However, there is no evidence to support this claim, and Biden and his legal team have maintained that the discovery of the documents was an honest mistake.\n\n## Discovery of classified documents at Mike Pence's residence\n\nIn February 2023, it was reported that classified documents had been found at the residence of former Vice President Mike Pence. The discovery was made by Pence's attorneys, who were conducting a review of his files in response to the discovery of the classified documents at Biden's home in Wilmington. The incident has raised questions about the handling of classified documents by former government officials, and has led to calls for greater transparency and accountability.\n\n# Investigations\n\n## Special counsel\n\nIn January 2023, Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed a special counsel to investigate the discovery of the classified documents at Biden's home in Wilmington. The special counsel, Robert Hur, is a former U.S. Attorney who has experience in national security cases. The investigation is focused on determining whether Biden or his staff mishandled the classified documents, and whether any laws were broken.\n\n### Decision that charges were unwarranted\n\nIn September 2023, the special counsel, Robert Hur, announced that he had concluded his investigation into the discovery of the classified documents at Biden's home in Wilmington. In a statement, Hur said that he had found no evidence of intentional wrongdoing by Biden or his staff, and that charges were unwarranted. Hur said that the discovery of the documents was \"a serious mistake,\" but that it was not a crime.\n\n### Comments on Biden's memory\n\nIn his report, Hur also commented on Biden's memory, saying that it was \"not what it used to be.\" Hur said that Biden had told him that he had not remembered storing the classified documents at his home in Wilmington, and that he had not recalled seeing them there. Hur said that he believed Biden's account, and that it was consistent with the evidence.\n\n## Congressional\n\nIn addition to the special counsel investigation, Congress has also launched its own investigation into the discovery of the classified documents at Biden's home in Wilmington. The investigation is being led by the House Oversight Committee, which is chaired by Representative James Comer. The committee has subpoenaed Biden's attorneys and other witnesses, and has requested documents related to the incident.\n\n# See also\n\n* Classified information in the United States\n* National Archives and Records Administration\n* Federal Bureau of Investigation\n* Department of Justice", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Joe_Biden_classified_documents_incident\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Discoveries and other developments\n##First batch of documents\n##DOJ letter to Bob Bauer\n##Second batch of documents\n##FBI search of Biden's Wilmington home\n##Other searches\n#Initial responses\n##Biden and his legal team\n##Elected officials\n###Republican elected officials\n###Democratic elected officials\n##Media analysis\n##Misinformation\n##Discovery of classified documents at Mike Pence's residence\n#Investigations\n##Special counsel\n###Decision that charges were unwarranted\n###Comments on Biden's memory\n##Congressional\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The battle involved Australian, Canadian, and South Korean forces against a massive Chinese army, and it resulted in a decisive victory for the United Nations Command (UNC). The battle took place near the village of Kapyong, which is located in the Gangwon-do province of South Korea.\n\n# Background\n\n## Military situation\n\nBy the spring of 1951, the Korean War had been ongoing for nearly a year. The UNC, led by General Matthew Ridgway, had been pushing the North Korean and Chinese forces back across the 38th parallel, but the enemy remained strong and determined. In March 1951, the Chinese launched a series of attacks against the UNC, which became known as the Chinese Spring Offensive. The aim of this offensive was to drive the UNC out of Korea and secure a decisive victory for the communist forces.\n\n# Chinese Spring Offensive\n\n## Preparations\n\nIn preparation for the Chinese Spring Offensive, the Chinese army assembled a massive force of over 700,000 soldiers, supported by artillery, tanks, and air power. The Chinese planned to attack the UNC along a broad front, using their superior numbers to overwhelm the enemy. The UNC, aware of the impending attack, prepared defensive positions and mobilized its forces for the impending battle.\n\n## Launch of Chinese Spring Offensive\n\nOn 22 April 1951, the Chinese launched their spring offensive, attacking the UNC positions along the Imjin River. The Chinese army made significant gains, pushing the UNC back and threatening to break through the defensive lines. The UNC responded with airstrikes and artillery bombardments, but the Chinese continued to press forward.\n\n## South Korean withdrawal, 22–23 April 1951\n\nAs the Chinese attacked, the South Korean forces began to withdraw from their positions. The South Korean 6th Division, which was positioned near the village of Kapyong, was ordered to fall back to a new defensive line. However, the withdrawal was disorganized, and many South Korean soldiers became isolated and cut off from their units.\n\n# Australian 3 RAR defence of Hill 504, 23–24 April 1951\n\n## Night battle\n\nOn the night of 23 April 1951, the Australian 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3 RAR), took up defensive positions on Hill 504, near Kapyong. The Australians were aware that the Chinese were advancing towards them, and they prepared for a fierce battle. As the Chinese attacked, the Australians held their ground, using machine guns and artillery to repel the enemy. The battle raged throughout the night, with the Australians fighting bravely against overwhelming odds.\n\n## Day battle\n\nOn the morning of 24 April 1951, the Chinese launched a fresh attack against the Australians on Hill 504. The Australians, exhausted but determined, continued to fight, using every available weapon to hold off the enemy. The battle was intense, with both sides suffering heavy casualties. However, the Australians managed to hold their ground, inflicting significant losses on the Chinese.\n\n## 3 RAR withdraws\n\nAs the day wore on, the Australians realized that their position on Hill 504 was becoming increasingly untenable. With the Chinese continuing to press forward, the Australians were ordered to withdraw to a new defensive line. The withdrawal was carried out under heavy fire, but the Australians managed to escape with minimal casualties.\n\n# Canadian 2 PPCLI last stand on Hill 677, 24–25 April 1951\n\n## Preparations\n\nAs the Australians withdrew from Hill 504, the Canadian 2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry (2 PPCLI), took up defensive positions on Hill 677, near Kapyong. The Canadians were aware that the Chinese were advancing towards them, and they prepared for a fierce battle. The Canadians dug in and prepared to make a last stand against the enemy.\n\n## Night battle\n\nOn the night of 24 April 1951, the Chinese launched a massive attack against the Canadians on Hill 677. The Canadians, using machine guns and artillery, fought bravely against the enemy. The battle raged throughout the night, with both sides suffering heavy casualties. However, the Canadians managed to hold their ground, inflicting significant losses on the Chinese.\n\n## Final 2 PPCLI Operations\n\nAs the night wore on, the Canadians realized that their position on Hill 677 was becoming increasingly untenable. With the Chinese continuing to press forward, the Canadians were ordered to withdraw to a new defensive line. However, before they could withdraw, the Canadians launched a final attack against the Chinese, using every available weapon to inflict maximum casualties on the enemy. The attack was successful, and the Canadians managed to escape with minimal casualties.\n\n# Aftermath\n\n## Summary and casualties\n\nThe Battle of Kapyong was a decisive victory for the UNC, with the Chinese suffering heavy casualties. The Australians and Canadians had fought bravely, inflicting significant losses on the enemy. The battle marked a turning point in the Korean War, as the Chinese realized that they could not defeat the UNC in a conventional battle.\n\n## Awards\n\nThe bravery and sacrifice of the Australians and Canadians during the Battle of Kapyong were recognized with numerous awards. The Australians were awarded several Victoria Crosses, while the Canadians were awarded several Distinguished Service Orders.\n\n## Subsequent operations\n\nAfter the Battle of Kapyong, the UNC continued to push the Chinese back across the 38th parallel. The Chinese, realizing that they could not defeat the UNC in a conventional battle, began to use guerrilla tactics to harass and disrupt the enemy. The UNC responded with counter-insurgency operations, using special forces to hunt down and destroy the Chinese guerrilla fighters.\n\n# See also\n\n* Korean War\n* Chinese Spring Offensive\n* Battle of Imjin River\n* Battle of Chosin Reservoir\n\n# Notes\n\n## Footnotes\n\n* The Battle of Kapyong was one of the most significant battles fought during the Korean War.\n* The Australians and Canadians fought bravely against overwhelming odds, inflicting significant losses on the Chinese.\n* The battle marked a turning point in the Korean War, as the Chinese realized that they could not defeat the UNC in a conventional battle.\n\n## Citations\n\n* (No citations are included in this article)\n\n# References\n\n* (No references are included in this article)\n\n# Further reading\n\n* The Korean War: A History, by Bruce Cumings\n* The Battle of Kapyong: A History, by Robert O'Neill\n* The Australians in Korea: A History, by Jeffrey Grey\n* The Canadians in Korea: A History, by Terry Copp", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Battle_of_Kapyong\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Military situation\n#Chinese Spring Offensive\n##Preparations\n##Launch of Chinese Spring Offensive\n##South Korean withdrawal, 22–23 April 1951\n#Australian 3 RAR defence of Hill 504, 23–24 April 1951\n##Night battle\n##Day battle\n##3 RAR withdraws\n#Canadian 2 PPCLI last stand on Hill 677, 24–25 April 1951\n##Preparations\n##Night battle\n##Final 2 PPCLI Operations\n#Aftermath\n##Summary and casualties\n##Awards\n##Subsequent operations\n#See also\n#Notes\n##Footnotes\n##Citations\n#References\n#Further reading\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

As a member of the Anglo-Norman Cruys family, John Cruys was a descendant of a prominent family that had settled in Ireland in the 12th century. Throughout his life, Cruys was involved in various aspects of Irish society, including politics, land ownership, and the administration of justice.\n\nBackground\n-----------\n\nThe Cruys family was of Norman origin and had settled in Ireland in the 12th century. They were granted large tracts of land by the English crown, particularly in the provinces of Leinster and Munster. Over time, the family became integrated into Irish society, adopting many of the customs and traditions of the native Irish population. John Cruys was a member of this family and was born in the late 14th century.

He was appointed as a justice of the peace in the province of Leinster and was involved in the administration of justice in the region. Cruys was also a member of the Irish parliament, serving as a representative for the county of Dublin. In this capacity, he played a significant role in shaping the laws and policies of late medieval Ireland.\n\nThe Verdon inheritance\n----------------------\n\nIn the early 15th century, John Cruys inherited the Verdon lands in County Louth. The Verdon family had been a prominent Anglo-Norman family in Ireland, with extensive landholdings in the provinces of Leinster and Ulster. The inheritance of the Verdon lands significantly increased Cruys' wealth and power, making him one of the most prominent landowners in Ireland.\n\nLater career\n-------------\n\nIn the latter part of his career, John Cruys became increasingly involved in the politics of late medieval Ireland. He was a supporter of the powerful Butler family, who dominated the politics of the region. Cruys also played a significant role in the administration of justice, serving as a justice of the peace and a member of the Irish parliament. He died in the mid-15th century, leaving behind a large family and extensive landholdings.\n\nFamily\n--------\n\nJohn Cruys was married to a member of the powerful FitzGerald family, with whom he had several children. His sons went on to play significant roles in the politics and society of late medieval Ireland, while his daughters married into other prominent Anglo-Norman families. The Cruys family continued to play an important role in Irish society for many generations, with many of its members serving as politicians, administrators, and landowners.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Anglo-Norman Ireland\n* Cruys family\n* Merrion Castle\n* Verdon family\n\nSources\n--------\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"John_Cruys\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Merrion Castle and other Cruys holdings\n#Career\n#The Verdon inheritance\n#Later career\n#Family\n#See also\n#Sources\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

They are one of the largest ethnic groups in the region and have a rich cultural heritage. The Bugis have a long history, with their roots dating back to the ancient times. They are known for their seafaring skills, maritime trade, and Islamic traditions.\n\n#Origins and antecedents\n\n##Toalean — Pre-Austronesian South Sulawesi\n\nThe earliest known human habitation in South Sulawesi dates back to the Toalean period, around 8000 BCE. During this time, the region was inhabited by pre-Austronesian people who lived in small settlements and engaged in hunting and gathering. The Toaleans were skilled craftsmen, producing sophisticated stone tools and pottery.\n\n##The arrival of Austronesians\n\nAround 3000 BCE, Austronesian-speaking people arrived in South Sulawesi, bringing with them new technologies, languages, and cultural practices. The Austronesians were skilled sailors and farmers, and they established settlements along the coastlines and rivers of the region. They introduced new crops, such as rice and maize, and developed more complex societies.\n\n##Tana Ogi — Land of the Bugis\n\nThe name \"Bugis\" is derived from the word \"Ugi,\" which means \"to sail\" or \"to navigate.\" The Bugis people were skilled sailors and traders, and their name reflects their maritime traditions. The Bugis homeland, known as Tana Ogi, is located in the southern part of Sulawesi, around the city of Makassar. The region is characterized by rugged terrain, dense forests, and numerous rivers and coastlines.\n\n#History\n\n##Early society\n\nThe early Bugis society was organized into small chiefdoms, each led by a local ruler or \"arung.\" These chiefdoms were often at odds with each other, competing for resources and territory. The Bugis people were skilled farmers, producing rice, maize, and other crops. They also engaged in maritime trade, exchanging goods such as spices, textiles, and metals.\n\n##The growth of Bugis kingdoms\n\nIn the 13th century, the Bugis kingdoms began to emerge, with the kingdom of Bone being the most prominent. The kingdom of Bone was founded by a legendary figure named To Manurung, who is said to have united the various Bugis chiefdoms under his rule. The kingdom of Bone was a powerful and prosperous state, controlling much of the region's trade and commerce.\n\n##Emergence of new political strengths over the peninsula\n\nIn the 16th century, new political powers emerged in the region, including the kingdom of Gowa and the kingdom of Tallo. These kingdoms were founded by powerful rulers who expanded their territories through conquest and diplomacy. The kingdom of Gowa, in particular, became a dominant power in the region, controlling much of the trade and commerce.\n\n##Bugis-Makassar society in the 16th century\n\nDuring the 16th century, the Bugis-Makassar society was characterized by a complex system of social hierarchy and bureaucracy. The society was divided into three main classes: the nobility, the commoners, and the slaves. The nobility held power and wealth, while the commoners worked as farmers, traders, and craftsmen. The slaves were at the bottom of the social hierarchy, performing menial tasks and labor.\n\n##Early attempts to Christianize the Bugis states\n\nIn the 16th century, European colonizers, particularly the Portuguese, attempted to Christianize the Bugis states. However, these attempts were met with resistance from the Bugis people, who were largely Muslim. The Bugis people saw Christianity as a threat to their Islamic traditions and way of life.\n\n##Quest for prestige, influence and powers over the peninsula\n\nThroughout the 17th and 18th centuries, the Bugis kingdoms continued to compete for power and influence in the region. The kingdom of Bone, in particular, sought to expand its territories and control the region's trade and commerce.\n\n##The Islamisation of Bugis-Makassar-Mandar\n\nIn the 17th century, Islam became the dominant religion in the region, with many Bugis people converting to Islam. The Islamization of the region was facilitated by the arrival of Muslim traders and missionaries from other parts of Indonesia and the Middle East.\n\n##The twilight of dominance\n\nBy the 19th century, the Bugis kingdoms had begun to decline, with the kingdom of Bone being the last to fall. The region was eventually colonized by the Dutch, who established a colonial administration and exploited the region's natural resources.\n\n##A new golden age\n\nIn the 20th century, the Bugis people experienced a cultural and economic revival, with many Bugis people becoming prominent in Indonesian politics, business, and culture. Today, the Bugis people continue to be an important part of Indonesian society, with their rich cultural heritage and traditions being celebrated and preserved.\n\n#Culture\n\n##Language and dialects\n\nThe Bugis language is an Austronesian language spoken by the Bugis people. The language has several dialects, including the Bone dialect, the Gowa dialect, and the Luwu dialect. The Bugis language is written using the Latin alphabet, as well as a traditional script known as the \"Lontara\" script.\n\n##Philosophy\n\nBugis philosophy is based on Islamic principles, with an emphasis on the importance of community, social hierarchy, and respect for authority. The Bugis people also have a strong tradition of mysticism, with many Bugis people practicing Sufism.\n\n##Traditional script\n\nThe Lontara script is a traditional script used by the Bugis people to write their language. The script is derived from the ancient Brahmi script and is characterized by intricate and ornate letterforms.\n\n##Folklore and literary traditions\n\nBugis folklore is rich in stories of heroes, legends, and myths. The Bugis people also have a strong tradition of oral literature, with many stories and poems being passed down through generations.\n\n##Dress, textiles and weaving traditions\n\nThe Bugis people are known for their traditional dress, which includes intricately woven textiles and colorful fabrics. The Bugis people also have a strong tradition of weaving, with many Bugis women skilled in the art of weaving and textile production.\n\n##Culinary traditions\n\nBugis cuisine is known for its spicy dishes, including sambals and curries. The Bugis people also have a strong tradition of seafood cuisine, with many dishes featuring fresh fish and seafood.\n\n##Weaponry and military traditions\n\nThe Bugis people have a long tradition of martial arts and military skills, with many Bugis people skilled in the use of swords, daggers, and other traditional weapons.\n\n##Traditional architecture\n\nBugis traditional architecture is characterized by wooden houses with intricate carvings and ornate decorations. The Bugis people also have a strong tradition of mosque architecture, with many beautiful mosques being built in the region.\n\n##Maritime, mercantile and migratory traditions\n\nThe Bugis people have a long tradition of maritime trade and commerce, with many Bugis people skilled in the art of sailing and navigation. The Bugis people also have a strong tradition of migration, with many Bugis people migrating to other parts of Indonesia and the world.\n\n##Rice and agrarian traditions\n\nThe Bugis people have a strong tradition of rice cultivation and agrarian practices, with many Bugis people skilled in the art of farming and agriculture.\n\n##Festivals, celebrations and religious traditions\n\nThe Bugis people have a rich tradition of festivals and celebrations, including the Islamic holidays of Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha. The Bugis people also have a strong tradition of traditional ceremonies and rituals, including the \"Mappadendang\" ceremony, which marks the beginning of the rice harvest season.\n\n##Musical traditions and performing arts\n\nThe Bugis people have a rich tradition of music and performing arts, including traditional dances, such as the \"Gandrung\" dance, and traditional music, such as the \"Kecapi\" instrument.\n\n#See also\n\n* Austronesian peoples\n* Indonesian culture\n* Islamic traditions in Indonesia\n* Maritime Southeast Asia\n* Sulu Archipelago\n\n#References\n\n(Note: As per the requirements, I have not included any citations or references in the article.)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Bugis\" following this outline:\n\n#Origins and antecedents\n##Toalean — Pre-Austronesian South Sulawesi\n##The arrival of Austronesians\n##Tana Ogi — Land of the Bugis\n#History\n##Early society\n##The growth of Bugis kingdoms\n##Emergence of new political strengths over the peninsula\n##Bugis-Makassar society in the 16th century\n##Early attempts to Christianize the Bugis states\n##Quest for prestige, influence and powers over the peninsula\n##The Islamisation of Bugis-Makassar-Mandar\n##The twilight of dominance\n##A new golden age\n#Culture\n##Language and dialects\n##Philosophy\n##Traditional script\n##Folklore and literary traditions\n##Dress, textiles and weaving traditions\n##Culinary traditions\n##Weaponry and military traditions\n##Traditional architecture\n##Maritime, mercantile and migratory traditions\n##Rice and agrarian traditions\n##Festivals, celebrations and religious traditions\n##Musical traditions and performing arts\n#See also\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

She is the leader of the Brothers of Italy (FdI) party and has been a prominent figure in Italian politics for over two decades. Meloni's rise to power has been marked by her strong nationalist and conservative stance, which has drawn both praise and criticism from various quarters.\n\nEarly life\n-----------\n\nGiorgia Meloni was born on January 15, 1977, in Rome, Italy. She grew up in a middle-class family and developed an interest in politics at a young age. Meloni's parents were both involved in local politics, and her father, Francesco Meloni, was a member of the Italian Social Movement (MSI), a neo-fascist party.\n\n### Education and early political activism\n\nMeloni attended the Liceo Classico Siena in Rome, where she developed a strong interest in classical studies. She later enrolled at the Sapienza University of Rome, where she studied political science. During her university days, Meloni became involved in student politics and joined the MSI's youth wing, the Fronte della Gioventù.\n\nMeloni's early involvement in politics was influenced by her family's neo-fascist leanings. However, she has since distanced herself from her family's past and has sought to rebrand herself as a mainstream conservative politician.\n\nPolitical career\n----------------\n\n### Minister of Youth\n\nIn 2008, Meloni was appointed Minister of Youth in the Berlusconi IV Cabinet. At the time, she was just 31 years old, making her one of the youngest ministers in Italian history. During her tenure, Meloni focused on promoting youth employment and education initiatives.\n\n### Leader of Brothers of Italy\n\nIn 2012, Meloni co-founded the Brothers of Italy party with Ignazio La Russa and Guido Crosetto. The party emerged from the ashes of the MSI and the National Alliance, and it quickly established itself as a major force in Italian politics.\n\nUnder Meloni's leadership, the FdI has become known for its strong nationalist and conservative stance. The party has been critical of the European Union and has advocated for a more isolationist foreign policy.\n\n### 2022 Italian general election\n\nIn the 2022 Italian general election, Meloni's FdI emerged as the largest party, winning over 26% of the vote. The party's strong performance was seen as a major upset, and it marked a significant shift to the right in Italian politics.\n\nPrime Minister of Italy\n----------------------\n\n### Government formation\n\nFollowing the 2022 election, Meloni was appointed Prime Minister of Italy by President Sergio Mattarella. She formed a coalition government with the League and Forza Italia, two other right-wing parties.\n\nMeloni's government has been marked by a strong nationalist and conservative agenda. The government has introduced several key policies, including a crackdown on immigration and a reduction in taxes.\n\n### Domestic policies\n\nMeloni's government has introduced several domestic policies aimed at promoting economic growth and reducing inequality. The government has increased funding for small businesses and has introduced a new tax credit for low-income families.\n\nHowever, the government's policies have also been criticized for being overly restrictive. The government's immigration policies have been particularly contentious, and they have drawn criticism from human rights groups.\n\n### Constitutional reform\n\nMeloni's government has also introduced several constitutional reforms aimed at strengthening the power of the executive. The reforms have been criticized for being undemocratic and for undermining the independence of the judiciary.\n\n### Foreign policy\n\nMeloni's government has taken a strong stance on foreign policy, advocating for a more isolationist approach. The government has been critical of the European Union and has advocated for a reduction in EU funding.\n\nHowever, the government's foreign policy has also been marked by several controversies. The government's approach to Russia has been particularly contentious, and it has drawn criticism from Western allies.\n\nPolitical positions\n-------------------\n\n### Social issues\n\nMeloni has been a strong advocate for conservative social policies.

The song was written by Gaga and Michael Tucker, and produced by Gaga, Tucker, and BloodPop.\n\nInfluences and Lyrical Content\n-----------------------------\n\n\"Bloody Mary\" is a song that draws inspiration from various sources, including literature, art, and personal experiences. Gaga has stated that the song was influenced by the works of Fyodor Dostoevsky, particularly his novel \"Crime and Punishment\". The song's lyrics also contain references to Catholicism and the story of Mary Magdalene.\n\n### Thematic Analysis\n\nThe song's lyrics are a introspective and emotional exploration of themes such as guilt, shame, and redemption. Gaga sings about feeling like a \"bloody Mary\" - a reference to the Catholic concept of Mary Magdalene, a woman who was said to have been forgiven by Jesus for her sins. The song's lyrics also touch on the idea of being trapped in a cycle of sin and guilt, and the desire for forgiveness and redemption.\n\nRecording and Composition\n------------------------\n\n\"Bloody Mary\" was recorded at various studios in Los Angeles and New York City. The song features a minimalist instrumental arrangement, with a focus on piano and vocal performance. Gaga has stated that she wanted to create a song that was stripped-back and emotionally raw, and that she drew inspiration from the work of artists such as Joni Mitchell and Carole King.\n\nThe song's production was handled by Gaga, Michael Tucker, and BloodPop. The three producers worked together to create a sparse and intimate sound, using a combination of acoustic and electronic elements to create a sense of tension and release.\n\nCritical Reception\n-----------------\n\n\"Bloody Mary\" received widespread critical acclaim upon its release. Reviewers praised the song's emotional intensity, lyrical depth, and Gaga's vocal performance. Many critics noted that the song was a departure from Gaga's previous work, and that it marked a new direction for the artist.\n\nRolling Stone described the song as \"a haunting and emotionally raw ballad\", while The New York Times praised Gaga's \"vocal virtuosity\" and the song's \"sparse and effective arrangement\". The song was also praised by critics for its lyrical depth and thematic complexity, with many noting that it was a standout track on the \"Joanne\" album.\n\nSingle Release and Media Appearances\n---------------------------------\n\n\"Bloody Mary\" was released as a single in 2017, and was accompanied by a music video directed by Ruth Hogben. The video features Gaga performing the song in a dimly lit, atmospheric setting, and was praised for its emotional intensity and visual style.\n\nThe song was also performed live by Gaga on several occasions, including during her \"Joanne World Tour\" and on the TV show \"Saturday Night Live\". The song's live performances were widely praised by critics, who noted that Gaga's vocal performance was particularly impressive.\n\nCommercial Performance\n--------------------\n\n\"Bloody Mary\" was a commercial success, reaching the top 10 in several countries including the US, UK, and Australia. The song was certified multi-platinum in several countries, and was named one of the best songs of 2017 by several publications.\n\nRemix Versions\n-------------\n\nSeveral remix versions of \"Bloody Mary\" were released, including a remix by DJ White Shadow and a remix by Skrillex. The remixes were well-received by critics and fans, and were praised for their creative reinterpretations of the original song.\n\nLive Performances\n----------------\n\n\"Bloody Mary\" was performed live by Gaga on several occasions, including during her \"Joanne World Tour\" and on the TV show \"Saturday Night Live\".

Shia Muslims in Lebanon have a rich and complex history that spans over 1,400 years, with significant events, figures, and cultural practices that have shaped their identity.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\n### Origins\n\nShia Islam was introduced to the region of Lebanon in the early days of Islam, during the lifetime of the Prophet Muhammad. The Shia sect emerged as a result of the dispute over the succession of the Prophet, with Shia Muslims believing that Ali ibn Abi Talib, the cousin and son-in-law of the Prophet, was the rightful successor. The Shia community in Lebanon grew and thrived, particularly in the Jabal Amel region, where it remains a dominant force to this day.\n\n### Early Islamic period\n\nDuring the early Islamic period, Shia Muslims in Lebanon played a significant role in the region's politics and culture. The Shia community was known for its scholars, poets, and theologians, who contributed to the development of Shia thought and literature. The city of Tyre, in particular, was a major center of Shia learning and culture.\n\n### Mamluk period\n\nUnder Mamluk rule (1260-1517), Shia Muslims in Lebanon faced significant challenges and persecution. The Mamluks, who were Sunni Muslims, viewed the Shia as heretics and took steps to suppress their activities and limit their influence. Many Shia scholars and leaders were forced to flee or go into hiding, while others were imprisoned or executed.\n\n### Under Ottoman rule\n\nThe Ottoman Empire, which ruled Lebanon from 1517 to 1918, had a complex and often tumultuous relationship with the Shia community. While the Ottomans were Sunni Muslims, they generally tolerated the Shia and allowed them to maintain their own institutions and practices. However, the Ottomans also imposed their own laws and regulations on the Shia community, which sometimes led to tensions and conflicts.\n\n#### Relations with Safavid Iran\n\nDuring the 16th century, the Shia Safavid Empire in Iran established close ties with the Shia community in Lebanon. The Safavids, who were Shia Muslims, saw the Lebanese Shia as natural allies and sought to promote their interests and influence in the region. The relationship between the Safavids and the Lebanese Shia was marked by cultural and intellectual exchanges, as well as military cooperation.\n\n### French mandate period\n\nUnder the French mandate (1920-1946), Shia Muslims in Lebanon experienced a period of significant change and modernization. The French introduced Western-style education and institutions, which had a profound impact on the Shia community. Many Shia Muslims began to adopt Western customs and practices, while others sought to maintain their traditional way of life.\n\n#### Education\n\nThe French established a network of schools and universities in Lebanon, which provided Shia Muslims with access to modern education. Many Shia students attended these institutions, where they studied a range of subjects, including French, Arabic, and Islamic studies.\n\n#### Ja'fari shar'ia courts\n\nIn 1926, the French established a Ja'fari shar'ia court in Beirut, which was responsible for governing the personal status of Shia Muslims. The court was headed by a Shia judge and was empowered to deal with matters such as marriage, divorce, and inheritance.\n\nSub-groups\n----------\n\n### Shia Twelvers (Metouali)\n\nThe Shia Twelvers, also known as the Metouali, are the largest Shia sub-group in Lebanon. They believe in the twelve imams, who are the successors of the Prophet Muhammad, and follow the Ja'fari school of thought.\n\n### Alawites\n\nThe Alawites are a Shia sub-group that originated in Syria but also have a significant presence in Lebanon. They have a unique set of beliefs and practices that distinguish them from other Shia Muslims.\n\n### Isma'ilis\n\nThe Isma'ilis are a Shia sub-group that has a small presence in Lebanon. They believe in the seven imams, who are the successors of the Prophet Muhammad, and follow the Isma'ili school of thought.\n\nGeographic distribution within Lebanon\n--------------------------------------\n\nShia Muslims are found throughout Lebanon, but they are concentrated in certain regions. The Jabal Amel region in southern Lebanon is a stronghold of Shia Islam, while the Bekaa Valley in eastern Lebanon is also home to a significant Shia population.\n\nDemographics\n------------\n\nShia Muslims make up around 30-40% of Lebanon's population, which is approximately 1.5-2 million people.\n\nGenetics\n--------\n\nGenetic studies have shown that Shia Muslims in Lebanon have a unique genetic profile that distinguishes them from other populations in the region. They have a high frequency of certain genetic markers, such as the Y-chromosome haplogroup J1, which is found in many Shia populations.\n\nNotable Lebanese Shia Muslims\n-----------------------------\n\n### Religious figures\n\n* Ayatollah Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah\n* Ayatollah Sayyed Muhammad Hussein Fadlallah\n* Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah\n\n### Political figures\n\n* Nabih Berri\n* Amal Movement\n* Hezbollah\n\n### Academics\n\n* Dr. Ali Fayyad\n* Dr. Kamal Salibi\n\n### Artists, singers and journalists\n\n* Fairouz\n* Sabah\n* Naji Hakim\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Shia Islam in Lebanon\n* Lebanese people\n* Islam in Lebanon\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nExternal links\n---------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Lebanese_Shia_Muslims\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Origins\n##Early Islamic period\n##Mamluk period\n##Under Ottoman rule\n###Relations with Safavid Iran\n##French mandate period\n###Education\n###Ja'fari shar'ia courts\n#Sub-groups\n##Shia Twelvers (Metouali)\n##Alawites\n##Isma'ilis\n#Geographic distribution within Lebanon\n#Demographics\n#Genetics\n#Notable Lebanese Shia Muslims\n##Religious figures\n##Political figures\n##Academics\n##Artists, singers and journalists\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He is considered one of the most important figures in Afghan history, known for his efforts to modernize and strengthen the country, as well as his complex relationships with European powers.\n\n#Background and rise to power\n\nDost Mohammad Khan was born in 1793 in Kandahar, Afghanistan, to a noble family of the Barakzai tribe. His early life is not well-documented, but it is known that he received a traditional Islamic education and was trained in the art of warfare. In 1818, he became the governor of Ghazni, a strategic city in eastern Afghanistan, and quickly gained a reputation as a skilled military leader.\n\nIn 1823, Dost Mohammad Khan seized power in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, and declared himself Emir. He faced opposition from other claimants to the throne, but was able to consolidate his power through a combination of military victories and strategic alliances.\n\n#European influence in Afghanistan\n\nDuring the early 19th century, Afghanistan was increasingly influenced by European powers, particularly Britain and Russia. The British East India Company had established a presence in India, and was seeking to expand its influence in Central Asia. Meanwhile, the Russian Empire was expanding its territories in the Caucasus and Central Asia, and saw Afghanistan as a key strategic location.\n\nDost Mohammad Khan was aware of the European powers' interest in Afghanistan, and sought to navigate their rivalries to his advantage. In 1837, he signed a treaty with the British, which recognized his sovereignty over Afghanistan and provided for trade and diplomatic relations between the two countries. However, the treaty also contained provisions that limited Afghan independence, and Dost Mohammad Khan soon came to regret his decision.\n\n#War with the Sikhs\n\nIn the late 1830s, Dost Mohammad Khan became embroiled in a conflict with the Sikh Empire, which controlled much of the Punjab region in northwestern India. The Sikhs had long been expansionist, and saw Afghanistan as a key prize. In 1837, they launched an invasion of Afghanistan, which Dost Mohammad Khan was unable to repel.\n\nThe war with the Sikhs weakened Dost Mohammad Khan's position, and he was eventually forced to flee Kabul. In 1839, the British launched their own invasion of Afghanistan, which led to the First Anglo-Afghan War. Dost Mohammad Khan was forced into exile, and the British installed a puppet government in Kabul.\n\n#Second reign\n\nIn 1842, Dost Mohammad Khan returned to power in Afghanistan, after the British had withdrawn from the country. He faced significant challenges, including the need to rebuild the Afghan army and economy, as well as to navigate the ongoing rivalries between European powers.\n\n##Conquest of the Balkh Wilayat\n\nOne of Dost Mohammad Khan's key objectives during his second reign was to conquer the Balkh Wilayat, a region in northern Afghanistan that was controlled by the Uzbek khanates. In 1850, he launched a successful campaign against the Uzbeks, and incorporated the Balkh Wilayat into the Afghan Empire.\n\n##Alliance with the British\n\nIn 1855, Dost Mohammad Khan signed a new treaty with the British, which established a formal alliance between the two countries.

The storm formed in the Atlantic Ocean on November 7, 2022, and rapidly intensified into a hurricane before making landfall in the Bahamas and later in Florida, USA. Nicole's impact was felt across several countries, including the Lesser Antilles, Greater Antilles, Bahamas, and the United States, with the storm causing significant damage to infrastructure, homes, and crops.\n\n#Meteorological history\n\nHurricane Nicole formed on November 7, 2022, from a tropical wave that had been moving westward across the Atlantic Ocean for several days. The wave had been monitored by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) since November 5, and by the morning of November 7, it had developed sufficient organization to be classified as a tropical depression. The depression rapidly strengthened into a tropical storm, and by the evening of November 7, it had become Hurricane Nicole, with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (120 km/h).\n\nOver the next 24 hours, Nicole rapidly intensified, with its winds increasing to 105 mph (165 km/h) by the morning of November 8. The storm's central pressure also dropped significantly, reaching a minimum of 965 mbar (28.50 inHg) on November 9. Nicole's rapid intensification was fueled by warm ocean waters and low wind shear, which allowed the storm to develop a strong circulation and a well-defined eye.\n\n#Preparations\n\n##Bahamas\n\nAs Nicole approached the Bahamas, the government issued a hurricane warning for the entire country, with residents advised to seek shelter and prepare for the worst. The Royal Bahamas Defence Force (RBDF) was deployed to assist with evacuations and relief efforts, and the Nassau Airport was closed until further notice.\n\n##United States\n\n###Florida\n\nIn Florida, Governor Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency ahead of Nicole's landfall, with residents advised to prepare for strong winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surge. The Florida National Guard was deployed to assist with evacuations and relief efforts, and several counties issued mandatory evacuation orders for low-lying areas.\n\n###Neighboring states\n\nIn neighboring states, including Georgia and South Carolina, residents were advised to prepare for heavy rainfall and strong winds, with flash flooding and power outages possible. The governors of both states declared states of emergency, with emergency management officials closely monitoring the storm's progress.\n\n#Impact\n\n##Lesser Antilles\n\nNicole's outer rain bands brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to the Lesser Antilles, with several islands experiencing power outages and flooding. The worst-affected islands were Martinique and St. Lucia, where several homes were damaged and roads were impassable.\n\n##Greater Antilles\n\nIn the Greater Antilles, Nicole's impact was felt across several countries, including Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and Cuba. In Haiti, several people were killed in flash flooding, with many more displaced. In the Dominican Republic, several homes were damaged, and roads were impassable. In Cuba, the storm caused significant damage to crops, with several thousand homes damaged or destroyed.\n\n##Bahamas\n\nIn the Bahamas, Nicole made landfall on November 9, bringing with it strong winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surge. The worst-affected areas were the Abaco Islands and Grand Bahama, where several homes were destroyed, and roads were impassable. The storm also caused significant damage to the country's infrastructure, including several bridges and roads.\n\n##United States\n\n###Florida\n\nIn Florida, Nicole made landfall on November 10, bringing with it strong winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surge. The worst-affected areas were the eastern coast of the state, including several counties that had been affected by Hurricane Ian just weeks earlier. Several homes were damaged or destroyed, and roads were impassable. The storm also caused significant damage to the state's agriculture, with several thousand acres of crops damaged or destroyed.\n\n###Elsewhere\n\nIn other parts of the United States, Nicole's impact was felt across several states, including Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina. In Georgia, several people were killed in flash flooding, with many more displaced. In South Carolina, several homes were damaged, and roads were impassable. In North Carolina, the storm caused significant damage to crops, with several thousand homes damaged or destroyed.\n\n##Canada\n\nIn Canada, Nicole's outer rain bands brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to several provinces, including Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island. The worst-affected areas were the provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, where several homes were damaged, and roads were impassable.\n\n#Aftermath\n\nIn the aftermath of Nicole, several countries and states declared states of emergency, with emergency management officials working to assess the damage and provide relief to affected areas. The storm caused significant damage to infrastructure, homes, and crops, with several thousand people displaced. The full extent of the damage is still being assessed, but it is clear that Nicole was a powerful and destructive storm that will have a lasting impact on several countries and states.\n\n#See also\n\n* List of Category 4 Atlantic hurricanes\n* List of Florida hurricanes (2000-present)\n* List of hurricanes in the Bahamas\n\n#External links\n\n* National Hurricane Center (NHC)\n* National Weather Service (NWS)\n* Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Hurricane_Nicole_(2022)\" following this outline:\n\n#Meteorological history\n#Preparations\n##Bahamas\n##United States\n###Florida\n###Neighboring states\n#Impact\n##Lesser Antilles\n##Greater Antilles\n##Bahamas\n##United States\n###Florida\n###Elsewhere\n##Canada\n#Aftermath\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

They were the key figures in the American Revolution and the drafting of the United States Constitution. The term \"Founding Fathers\" was first used in the early 20th century to describe the individuals who signed the Declaration of Independence in 1776. However, the term has since been expanded to include other individuals who made significant contributions to the country's early development.\n\n# Historical founders\n\nThe historical founders of the United States were a diverse group of individuals who came from different backgrounds and had different motivations for seeking independence from Great Britain. Some, like George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, were wealthy landowners who wanted to protect their economic interests. Others, like Samuel Adams and Patrick Henry, were passionate patriots who believed in the cause of American independence.\n\n# Origin of phrase\n\nThe term \"Founding Fathers\" was first used by Warren G. Harding in a 1916 speech. However, it gained popularity in the 1920s and 1930s as a way to describe the individuals who signed the Declaration of Independence. The term was also used to describe other individuals who played important roles in the American Revolution and the early years of the United States.\n\n# List of Founding Fathers\n\n## Framers and signers\n\nThe following individuals were among the key Founding Fathers who framed and signed the Declaration of Independence:\n\n* George Washington\n* John Adams\n* Thomas Jefferson\n* Benjamin Franklin\n* Robert Livingston\n* Roger Sherman\n* James Madison\n* Alexander Hamilton\n* John Jay\n* Samuel Adams\n* Patrick Henry\n\n### Other delegates\n\nOther delegates who played important roles in the Continental Congress and the drafting of the Declaration of Independence include:\n\n* George Mason\n* James Wilson\n* George Clymer\n* William Ellery\n* Oliver Wolcott\n* William Williams\n\n## Additional Founding Fathers\n\nOther individuals who made significant contributions to the country's early development include:\n\n* George Rogers Clark\n* John Paul Jones\n* Francis Marion\n* Nathanael Greene\n* Henry Knox\n* John Sullivan\n\n## Women founders\n\nWhile women did not play a direct role in the drafting of the Declaration of Independence, several women made significant contributions to the American Revolution and the early years of the United States.

The compromise called for equal representation from each state, regardless of population.\n\n## State ratification conventions\n\nThe Constitution was ratified by the necessary number of states in 1788. The ratification process was contentious, with some states opposing the document's provisions.\n\n## New form of government\n\nThe Constitution established a new form of government, based on federalism and the separation of powers. The document established the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government.\n\n## Bill of Rights\n\nThe Bill of Rights, the first 10 amendments to the Constitution, was adopted in 1791.

The election was won by Humza Yousaf, who became the first Muslim leader of a major UK party.\n\nBackground\n\nNicola Sturgeon had been the leader of the Scottish National Party since 2014, and had been the First Minister of Scotland since 2014. However, on 15 February 2023, she announced her intention to resign as leader of the party and as First Minister, citing the challenges of the job and the need for fresh leadership. The party's national executive committee (NEC) met to discuss the process for electing a new leader, and it was decided that the election would be held using a one-member-one-vote system.\n\nIssues\n\n### Economics\n\nThe Scottish economy was a major issue in the election, with all three candidates proposing different approaches to economic growth and development. Kate Forbes proposed a more cautious approach, arguing that the Scottish Government should focus on supporting existing businesses and industries. Ash Regan proposed a more radical approach, arguing that the Scottish Government should take a more active role in shaping the economy and promoting economic growth. Humza Yousaf proposed a more balanced approach, arguing that the Scottish Government should support both existing businesses and new industries.\n\n### Independence\n\nThe issue of Scottish independence was also a major factor in the election, with all three candidates supporting independence but differing on the timing and approach. Kate Forbes argued that the Scottish Government should focus on building support for independence and preparing for a referendum, but not rush into holding one. Ash Regan argued that the Scottish Government should hold a referendum as soon as possible, and be prepared to take a more radical approach to achieving independence. Humza Yousaf argued that the Scottish Government should continue to make the case for independence, but also be prepared to work with other parties and build a broader coalition in support of independence.\n\n### Gender recognition reform\n\nThe issue of gender recognition reform was also a contentious issue in the election, with the three candidates differing on the Scottish Government's approach to reforming the Gender Recognition Act. Kate Forbes expressed concerns about the impact of the reforms on women's rights and children's safety, while Ash Regan and Humza Yousaf supported the reforms and argued that they were necessary to promote equality and human rights.\n\nCampaign\n\n### Nomination period\n\nThe nomination period for the election opened on 15 February 2023, and closed on 22 February 2023. During this period, candidates had to secure the support of at least 100 party members and submit a nomination fee of £1,000.\n\n### Kate Forbes\n\nKate Forbes, the Finance Secretary, launched her campaign on 20 February 2023. She argued that she had the experience and skills necessary to lead the party and the country, and proposed a more cautious approach to economic growth and development.\n\n### Ash Regan\n\nAsh Regan, the former Community Safety Minister, launched her campaign on 20 February 2023.

He argued that he had the experience and skills necessary to lead the party and the country, and proposed a more balanced approach to economic growth and development.\n\n### Hustings\n\nA series of hustings events were held around Scotland, where the three candidates debated the issues and answered questions from party members. The hustings were widely covered in the media, and helped to raise the profile of the candidates and the election.\n\n### Row about membership numbers\n\nA row broke out during the campaign about the number of party members, with the party's national executive committee (NEC) refusing to release the exact number of members. The candidates and their supporters accused the NEC of trying to manipulate the election, while the NEC argued that it was necessary to protect the privacy of party members.\n\nElection process\n\nThe election was held using a one-member-one-vote system, where every party member had one vote. The votes were counted using a preferential voting system, where voters ranked the candidates in order of preference. The candidate with the fewest first-preference votes was eliminated, and their second-preference votes were redistributed to the remaining candidates.

The attack, which shocked the literary world and sparked widespread condemnation, occurred over 30 years after Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa calling for Rushdie's death in response to the publication of his novel \"The Satanic Verses\".\n\nBackground\n\nSalman Rushdie, a prominent author known for his works of magical realism, had been the subject of a fatwa issued by Ayatollah Khomeini in 1989. The fatwa, which called for Rushdie's death, was in response to the publication of his novel \"The Satanic Verses\", which some Muslims believed blasphemed against the Prophet Muhammad. The fatwa led to a significant increase in security measures for Rushdie, who was forced to live in hiding for several years. Although the Iranian government officially lifted the fatwa in 1998, many believed that it was still in effect, and Rushdie continued to face threats and intimidation.\n\nAttack\n\nOn August 12, 2022, Rushdie was scheduled to give a lecture at the Chautauqua Institution, a non-profit educational center in Chautauqua, New York. As he took the stage, a man rushed forward and stabbed him multiple times in the neck and torso. The attacker, who was later identified as Hadi Matar, was subdued by audience members and security personnel. Rushdie was airlifted to a nearby hospital, where he underwent emergency surgery.\n\nInjuries and recovery\n\nRushdie suffered serious injuries in the attack, including a punctured lung and damage to his liver. He underwent emergency surgery and was placed on a ventilator. His condition was initially listed as critical, but he was later upgraded to stable. Rushdie's agent, Andrew Wylie, reported that the author was likely to lose an eye and had suffered nerve damage in his arm. Rushdie was eventually transferred to a rehabilitation center, where he began the long process of recovery.\n\nCriminal investigation and prosecution\n\n## Suspect\n\nHadi Matar, a 24-year-old man from Fairview, New Jersey, was arrested and charged with attempted murder in the second degree. Matar, who was born in the United States to Lebanese parents, had traveled to Iran in 2018, where he had become radicalized. According to officials, Matar had been inspired by the fatwa against Rushdie and had planned the attack for months. Matar had also been in contact with members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, who had encouraged him to carry out the attack.\n\nResponse\n\n## United States\n\nThe attack on Rushdie was widely condemned by officials in the United States. President Joe Biden released a statement expressing his shock and outrage at the attack, and calling for the perpetrator to be brought to justice. The FBI launched an investigation into the attack, and the Department of Justice announced that it would be charging Matar with attempted murder.\n\n## Iran\n\nThe Iranian government was quick to distance itself from the attack, with a spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry stating that Iran had no connection to the incident. However, many observers noted that the attack was consistent with the long-standing fatwa against Rushdie, and that the Iranian government had done little to retract or condemn the fatwa in the years since its issuance.\n\n## Hezbollah\n\nHezbollah, a Shia Islamist organization based in Lebanon, released a statement praising the attack on Rushdie. The statement, which was issued by the organization's deputy secretary-general, Naim Qassem, called the attack a \"heroic\" act and praised Matar for his bravery.\n\n## Other nations\n\nThe attack on Rushdie was widely condemned by governments and literary organizations around the world. The British government, in particular, was vocal in its condemnation, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson releasing a statement expressing his shock and outrage at the attack. The French government also condemned the attack, with President Emmanuel Macron calling it a \"cowardly\" act.\n\nCultural effect\n\nThe attack on Rushdie has had a significant impact on the literary world, with many authors and writers expressing their outrage and solidarity with the victim. The attack has also sparked a wider debate about the role of free speech and the dangers of censorship.\n\n## Memoir\n\nRushdie has announced plans to write a memoir about the attack and its aftermath. The book, which is expected to be published in 2024, will provide a detailed account of the attack and Rushdie's recovery, as well as his reflections on the wider cultural and literary implications of the incident.\n\nSecurity at the Chautauqua Institution\n\nThe attack on Rushdie has raised questions about the security measures in place at the Chautauqua Institution. The institution has stated that it had taken steps to increase security in the wake of the fatwa against Rushdie, but many have questioned whether these measures were sufficient. The institution has announced plans to review its security protocols in the wake of the attack.\n\nSee also\n\n* The Satanic Verses controversy\n* Fatwa\n* Censorship\n* Free speech\n* Literary criticism\n* Magical realism", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Stabbing_of_Salman_Rushdie\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Attack\n#Injuries and recovery\n#Criminal investigation and prosecution\n##Suspect\n#Response\n##United States\n##Iran\n##Hezbollah\n##Other nations\n#Cultural effect\n##Memoir\n#Security at the Chautauqua Institution\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
