It is one of the Windward Islands, a chain of islands that form the eastern boundary of the Caribbean Sea. The island has a rich history, diverse culture, and breathtaking natural beauty, making it a popular tourist destination.\n\nEtymology\n-----------\n\nThe island of Saint Lucia was named by the French, who first settled on the island in 1660. The name \"Saint Lucia\" is derived from the Latin name \"Lucia,\" which means \"light.\" According to legend, the name was chosen because the island was discovered on December 13, the feast day of Saint Lucia.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\n### Pre-colonial period\n\nThe island of Saint Lucia was first inhabited by the indigenous Arawak people, who migrated from the mainland hundreds of years before the arrival of European colonizers. The Arawak people lived in small villages and survived on a diet of fish, shellfish, and tropical fruits.\n\n### Early European period\n\nIn 1498, Christopher Columbus sailed past the island on his third voyage to the New World. However, it was not until 1660 that the French established the first European settlement on the island. The French colonizers brought enslaved Africans to the island to work on sugar plantations, which became the mainstay of the island's economy.\n\n### 18th and 19th centuries\n\nDuring the 18th and 19th centuries, Saint Lucia changed hands between the French and British several times. The British eventually gained control of the island in 1814, and it remained a British colony until it gained independence in 1979. During this period, the island's economy continued to be based on sugar production, with enslaved Africans and later indentured servants from Asia working on the plantations.\n\n### 20th century\n\nIn the 20th century, the island's economy began to diversify, with tourism becoming an increasingly important sector. The island also experienced a significant growth in population, which put pressure on the country's resources and infrastructure.\n\n### Post-independence era\n\nSaint Lucia gained independence from Britain on February 22, 1979. The country has since become a member of the Commonwealth of Nations and the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS). Saint Lucia has also developed a strong economy, with a high standard of living and a low poverty rate.\n\nGeography\n----------\n\n### Climate\n\nSaint Lucia has a tropical climate, with high temperatures and high humidity throughout the year. The island is susceptible to hurricanes, which can cause significant damage to the country's infrastructure and agriculture.\n\n### Geology\n\nThe island of Saint Lucia is volcanic in origin, with a chain of volcanic peaks running along the center of the island. The highest peak is Mount Gimie, which rises to a height of 3,120 feet (950 meters) above sea level. The island's geology is characterized by volcanic rocks, including basalt and andesite.\n\nGovernment\n-----------\n\n### Administrative divisions\n\nSaint Lucia is divided into 11 administrative districts, each with its own local government. The districts are:\n\n1. Anse-la-Raye\n2. Castries\n3. Choiseul\n4. Dennery\n5. Gros-Islet\n6. Laborie\n7. Micoud\n8. Praslin\n9. Soufrière\n10. Vieux-Fort\n11. Canaries\n\n### Law and crime\n\nThe law of Saint Lucia is based on the British common law system. The country has a court system, with a High Court and a Court of Appeal. The police force is responsible for maintaining law and order on the island.\n\n### Foreign relations\n\nSaint Lucia is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations and the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS). The country has diplomatic relations with several countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada.\n\nEconomy\n--------\n\n### Tourism\n\nTourism is an important sector of the Saint Lucian economy, with visitors attracted to the island's natural beauty, beaches, and cultural heritage. The island has a range of hotels, resorts, and guesthouses, as well as a variety of activities, including hiking, diving, and sailing.\n\n### Agriculture\n\nAgriculture is also an important sector of the Saint Lucian economy, with the main crops being bananas, coconuts, and cocoa. The country is also known for its production of tropical fruits, including mangoes, papayas, and pineapples.\n\n### Infrastructure\n\nThe island has a range of infrastructure, including a international airport, a seaport, and a network of roads. The country also has a range of telecommunications services, including mobile phone networks and internet access.\n\nDemographics\n------------\n\n### Ethnic groups\n\nThe population of Saint Lucia is predominantly black, with a small minority of people of European and Asian descent. The country has a small but significant proportion of people of indigenous Arawak descent.\n\n### Languages\n\nThe official language of Saint Lucia is English, but the majority of the population speaks a creole language known as Saint Lucian Creole or Kweyol.\n\n### Religion\n\nThe majority of the population of Saint Lucia is Christian, with the main denominations being Roman Catholic, Anglican, and Methodist.\n\n### Education\n\nEducation is compulsory for children between the ages of 5 and 15. The country has a range of schools, including primary schools, secondary schools, and a university.\n\n### Healthcare\n\nThe country has a range of healthcare facilities, including hospitals, clinics, and health centers.

He is best known for his exquisite Cosway bindings, which are highly prized by collectors and institutions for their beauty and craftsmanship. Stonehouse's work also extended to the binding of important literary works, including those of Charles Dickens.\n\n# Early life and family\n\nJohn Harrison Stonehouse was born in 1864 in London, England. Little is known about his early life, but it is believed that he came from a family of modest means. Stonehouse's interest in bookbinding likely began at a young age, and he may have apprenticed with a local bookbinder to learn the trade.\n\nIn 1885, Stonehouse married Emily Jane Goddard, and the couple had two children, a son and a daughter. The family lived in a small house in the London suburb of Hampstead, where Stonehouse maintained a workshop and bindery.\n\n# Career\n\nStonehouse's career as a bookbinder spanned over four decades, during which time he established himself as one of the leading binders of his generation. His work was highly regarded by collectors and institutions, and he was particularly known for his exquisite Cosway bindings.\n\n## Cosway bindings\n\nCosway bindings are a type of binding that originated in the 18th century and are characterized by intricate, hand-tooled designs on the cover. Stonehouse was a master of this style, and his Cosway bindings are highly prized by collectors for their beauty and craftsmanship.\n\nStonehouse's Cosway bindings typically featured elaborate designs, often incorporating gold and silver tooling. He was particularly fond of using floral motifs, which he would carefully tool onto the cover of the book. His bindings were also notable for their use of fine leathers, including morocco and vellum.\n\n## The \"Great Omar\"\n\nOne of Stonehouse's most famous bindings is the \"Great Omar\", a copy of Edward FitzGerald's translation of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam. The binding is considered one of the greatest examples of Cosway binding in existence, and it is now housed at the British Library.\n\nThe \"Great Omar\" binding features an intricate, hand-tooled design on the cover, which includes gold and silver tooling. The binding is made from fine morocco leather, and it is adorned with a delicate, hand-painted design on the spine.\n\n## Charles Dickens\n\nStonehouse was also known for his bindings of Charles Dickens' works. He produced several notable bindings of Dickens' novels, including \"Oliver Twist\" and \"David Copperfield\". Stonehouse's bindings of Dickens' works are highly regarded by collectors for their beauty and craftsmanship.\n\nOne of Stonehouse's most famous bindings of a Dickens novel is his binding of \"A Christmas Carol\". The binding features an intricate, hand-tooled design on the cover, which includes gold and silver tooling. The binding is made from fine morocco leather, and it is adorned with a delicate, hand-painted design on the spine.\n\n# Death and legacy\n\nJohn Harrison Stonehouse died in 1938 at the age of 74. He left behind a legacy as one of the greatest bookbinders of his generation, and his work continues to be highly regarded by collectors and institutions.\n\nStonehouse's bindings are now housed in institutions around the world, including the British Library and the Victoria and Albert Museum. His work continues to inspire bookbinders and collectors, and his legacy as a master bookbinder remains unparalleled.\n\n# Selected publications\n\n* \"The Art of Bookbinding\" (1901)\n* \"A Guide to Bookbinding\" (1910)\n* \"The Bookbinder's Manual\" (1920)\n\n# References\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)\n\n# Further reading\n\n* \"The Bookbinder's Art\" by Bernard C.

The drone has gained significant attention in recent years due to its deployment in various conflict zones around the world.\n\n# Overview\n\n## Description\n\nThe Shahed 136 is a small, delta-winged drone made of composite materials, with a length of approximately 3.5 meters (11.5 feet) and a wingspan of around 2.5 meters (8.2 feet). It has a takeoff weight of about 200 kilograms (440 pounds) and is powered by a small gasoline engine. The drone is equipped with a warhead, which can be either high-explosive fragmentation or armor-piercing, and has a reported range of around 2,000 kilometers (1,243 miles).\n\n## Deployment\n\nThe Shahed 136 is typically launched from a catapult or a rail launcher and can be recovered using a parachute if it is not used in a combat mission. The drone can be controlled remotely or programmed to fly autonomously using GPS and terrain-following radar. It has a reported speed of around 185 kilometers per hour (115 miles per hour) and can stay aloft for several hours.\n\n## Comms and guidance system\n\nThe Shahed 136 uses a satellite communication system for command and control, which allows it to receive updates and commands from its operators. The drone is also equipped with a GPS system and terrain-following radar, which enable it to navigate and track its targets.\n\n## Electronics\n\nThe Shahed 136's electronics are reportedly based on a Linux operating system and use a combination of commercial and custom-made components. The drone's software is designed to allow it to adapt to different mission profiles and to communicate with its operators in real-time.\n\n# Geran-2\n\nThe Geran-2 is a Russian-made variant of the Shahed 136, which has been reported to be in production in Russia. The Geran-2 is believed to be based on the Shahed 136's design, but with some modifications to its electronics and guidance system.\n\n# Combat history\n\n## Yemeni Civil War\n\nThe Shahed 136 has been used in the Yemeni Civil War, where it has been employed by Houthi rebels against Saudi-led coalition forces. The drone has been used to attack coalition bases and ships, and has reportedly caused significant damage.\n\n## Russian invasion of Ukraine\n\n### First appearances\n\nThe Shahed 136 first appeared in Ukraine in September 2022, where it was used by Russian forces to attack Ukrainian targets. The drone was initially identified as a Geran-2, but later reports confirmed that it was a Shahed 136.\n\n### October waves\n\nIn October 2022, Ukraine reported a significant increase in Shahed 136 attacks, with multiple drones being shot down by Ukrainian air defenses. The attacks targeted Ukrainian cities and infrastructure, causing widespread damage and casualties.\n\n### Ukrainian defense\n\nUkraine has developed countermeasures to defend against the Shahed 136, including the use of air defense systems and electronic warfare tactics. The country has also reported that it has shot down numerous Shahed 136 drones, with some reports suggesting that as many as 80% of the drones have been destroyed.\n\n### Production in Russia\n\nThere have been reports that the Shahed 136 is being produced in Russia, with some sources suggesting that the country is producing its own variant of the drone. However, these reports have not been confirmed.\n\n### Reactions\n\nThe use of the Shahed 136 in Ukraine has been widely condemned by Western countries, which have accused Russia of using the drone to attack civilian targets. The United States has imposed sanctions on Iranian companies involved in the production of the Shahed 136, and has warned that it will take further action if the drone continues to be used in Ukraine.\n\n## 2022 Syria and Iraqi Kurdistan\n\nThe Shahed 136 has also been used in Syria and Iraqi Kurdistan, where it has been employed by Iranian-backed forces to attack opposition targets. The drone has reportedly been used to attack Kurdish forces in northern Syria and to target opposition strongholds in Iraq.\n\n## 2023 Indian Ocean\n\nIn 2023, the Shahed 136 was reportedly used to attack an Israeli ship in the Indian Ocean. The attack was attributed to Iranian forces, who have denied any involvement.\n\n## 2024 Iranian strikes on Israel\n\nIn 2024, Iran launched a series of strikes on Israeli targets, including military bases and ships. The Shahed 136 was reportedly used in the attacks, which were seen as a significant escalation of tensions between Iran and Israel.\n\n# Classification controversy\n\nThere has been controversy over the classification of the Shahed 136, with some countries viewing it as a drone and others as a cruise missile. The debate has significant implications for international law and the regulation of unmanned aerial vehicles.\n\n# Relations with other Shahed drones\n\n## Shahed 131\n\nThe Shahed 131 is a smaller variant of the Shahed 136, which has been used in Yemen and other conflict zones. The Shahed 131 has a shorter range and a smaller warhead than the Shahed 136, but is reportedly more agile and easier to use.\n\n## Shahed 238\n\nThe Shahed 238 is a larger variant of the Shahed 136, which has been used in Syria and other conflict zones. The Shahed 238 has a longer range and a larger warhead than the Shahed 136, but is reportedly less agile and more difficult to use.\n\n# Operators\n\nThe Shahed 136 has been used by a number of countries and non-state actors, including Iran, Russia, and Houthi rebels in Yemen.\n\n# See also\n\n* HESA\n* Geran-2\n* Shahed 131\n* Shahed 238\n* Loitering munition\n* Kamikaze drone\n\n# External links\n\n* HESA official website\n* Geran-2 official website\n* Shahed 136 technical specifications", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"HESA_Shahed_136\" following this outline:\n\n#Overview\n##Description\n##Deployment\n##Comms and guidance system\n##Electronics\n#Geran-2\n#Combat history\n##Yemeni Civil War\n##Russian invasion of Ukraine\n###First appearances\n###October waves\n###Ukrainian defense\n###Production in Russia\n###Reactions\n##2022 Syria and Iraqi Kurdistan\n##2023 Indian Ocean\n##2024 Iranian strikes on Israel\n#Classification controversy\n#Relations with other Shahed drones\n##Shahed 131\n##Shahed 238\n#Operators\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He is the longest-serving President in Italian history, having served two consecutive terms. Prior to his presidency, Napolitano had a long and distinguished career in Italian politics, serving in various capacities including as a member of the Italian Communist Party, President of the Chamber of Deputies, and Minister of the Interior.\n\n#Early life\n\nGiorgio Napolitano was born on June 29, 1925, in Naples, Italy. His family was of modest means, and his father was a lawyer. Napolitano grew up in a culturally rich environment, surrounded by the art, literature, and music of Naples. He developed a strong interest in politics at an early age, influenced by his family's liberal and democratic values.\n\nNapolitano attended the University of Naples Federico II, where he studied law. During his university years, he became involved in the Italian Resistance movement against the fascist regime of Benito Mussolini.\n\n#Early political career\n\n##World War II and anti-fascist resistance\n\nNapolitano's involvement in the Italian Resistance began in 1942, when he joined the Italian Co-Belligerent Army, a military force that fought alongside the Allies against the Axis powers. After the war, he became a member of the Italian Socialist Party, but soon joined the Italian Communist Party (PCI), which he would remain a member of for over 40 years.\n\n##From post-war years to the Hungarian Revolution of 1956\n\nIn the post-war years, Napolitano became a prominent figure in the PCI, serving as a member of the party's central committee and as a deputy in the Italian Parliament. He was a strong supporter of the Soviet Union and the communist ideology, but also advocated for greater democracy and reform within the PCI.\n\nDuring the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, Napolitano was part of a PCI delegation that traveled to Hungary to show support for the Soviet-backed government. However, he later became critical of the Soviet Union's actions in Hungary and began to distance himself from the party's hardline stance.\n\n#Leading member of the Italian Communist Party\n\n##From the 1960s to 1980s\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, Napolitano became a leading figure in the PCI, serving as a member of the party's secretariat and as a deputy in the Italian Parliament. He was a key proponent of the party's strategy of \"historic compromise,\" which sought to form alliances with other left-wing parties and to promote democratic reform.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Napolitano played a key role in the PCI's transformation into a more moderate and reformist party. He was a strong supporter of the party's new leader, Enrico Berlinguer, and worked to promote greater democracy and transparency within the party.\n\n#After the Italian Communist Party\n\n##President of the Chamber of Deputies\n\nIn 1992, Napolitano was elected President of the Chamber of Deputies, a position he held until 1994. During his tenure, he played a key role in promoting reform and modernization of the Italian Parliament.\n\n##Late 1990s and early 2000s\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, Napolitano served as a minister in several Italian governments, including as Minister of the Interior and Minister of the Treasury. He was a strong advocate for greater European integration and played a key role in promoting Italy's participation in the European Union.\n\n#President of Italy\n\n##First term (2006–2013)\n\n###Election\n\nNapolitano was elected President of Italy on May 10, 2006, with the support of the center-left coalition. He was the first former communist to hold the office.\n\n###Prodi Cabinet\n\nDuring his first term, Napolitano worked closely with Prime Minister Romano Prodi, who led a center-left government. Napolitano played a key role in promoting stability and reform, and worked to promote greater European integration.\n\n###2008 political crisis\n\nIn 2008, Napolitano played a key role in resolving a political crisis that followed the collapse of the Prodi government. He worked to promote a new government, led by Silvio Berlusconi, and played a key role in promoting stability and reform.\n\n###Eluana Englaro incident\n\nIn 2009, Napolitano was involved in a controversy surrounding the case of Eluana Englaro, a woman who had been in a coma for 17 years. Napolitano refused to sign a decree that would have allowed Englaro's family to remove her life support, citing concerns about the constitutionality of the decree.\n\n###2011 political crisis\n\nIn 2011, Napolitano played a key role in resolving a political crisis that followed the collapse of the Berlusconi government. He worked to promote a new government, led by Mario Monti, and played a key role in promoting stability and reform.\n\n##Second term (2013–2015)\n\n###Re-election\n\nNapolitano was re-elected President of Italy on April 20, 2013, with the support of the center-left coalition. He was the first Italian president to serve two consecutive terms.\n\n###Letta Cabinet\n\nDuring his second term, Napolitano worked closely with Prime Minister Enrico Letta, who led a center-left government. Napolitano played a key role in promoting stability and reform, and worked to promote greater European integration.\n\n###Renzi Cabinet\n\nIn 2014, Napolitano played a key role in promoting the formation of a new government, led by Matteo Renzi. He worked to promote stability and reform, and played a key role in promoting greater European integration.\n\n##Resignation\n\nNapolitano resigned as President of Italy on January 14, 2015, citing health reasons. He was succeeded by Sergio Mattarella.\n\n##Later life\n\nAfter his resignation, Napolitano returned to private life. He has remained active in politics, and has continued to promote greater European integration and democratic reform.\n\n#Personal life\n\n##Relations with the Catholic Church\n\nNapolitano has had a complex relationship with the Catholic Church throughout his life. While he was raised as a Catholic, he has been critical of the Church's stance on social issues such as abortion and same-sex marriage.\n\n##Death and state funeral\n\nGiorgio Napolitano passed away on September 22, 2023, at the age of 98. He was given a state funeral, which was attended by dignitaries from across Italy and Europe.\n\n#Legacy\n\nNapolitano's legacy is complex and multifaceted. He is remembered as a key figure in Italian politics, who played a leading role in promoting democratic reform and European integration. He is also remembered for his commitment to social justice and human rights.\n\n#Electoral history\n\n##First-past-the-post elections\n\nNapolitano was elected to the Italian Parliament in 1953, and served as a deputy until 1996.\n\n##Presidential elections\n\nNapolitano was elected President of Italy in 2006, and re-elected in 2013.\n\n#Honours\n\n##National honours\n\nNapolitano has been awarded numerous national honors, including the Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic.\n\n##Foreign honours\n\nNapolitano has been awarded numerous foreign honors, including the Grand Cross of the Order of the Legion of Honour of France.\n\n#See also\n\n* Italian Communist Party\n* President of Italy\n* Italian Parliament\n* European Union\n\n#References\n\n*none*\n\n#Bibliography\n\n*none*\n\n#External links\n\n*none*", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Giorgio_Napolitano\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n#Early political career\n##World War II and anti-fascist resistance\n##From post-war years to the Hungarian Revolution of 1956\n#Leading member of the Italian Communist Party\n##From the 1960s to 1980s\n#After the Italian Communist Party\n##President of the Chamber of Deputies\n##Late 1990s and early 2000s\n#President of Italy\n##First term (2006–2013)\n###Election\n###Prodi Cabinet\n###2008 political crisis\n###Eluana Englaro incident\n###2011 political crisis\n##Second term (2013–2015)\n###Re-election\n###Letta Cabinet\n###Renzi Cabinet\n##Resignation\n##Later life\n#Personal life\n##Relations with the Catholic Church\n##Death and state funeral\n#Legacy\n#Electoral history\n##First-past-the-post elections\n##Presidential elections\n#Honours\n##National honours\n##Foreign honours\n#See also\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is an independent branch of power, separate from the executive and legislative branches, and is designed to ensure that the laws of Poland are applied fairly and impartially. The judiciary is composed of various types of courts, including common courts, military courts, the Supreme Court, administrative courts, the Constitutional Tribunal, and the State Tribunal.\n\n# Structure\n\n## Common courts\n\nCommon courts are the most numerous type of court in Poland, with jurisdiction over civil, criminal, and family law cases. They are divided into three levels: district courts, regional courts, and courts of appeal. District courts are the lowest level of court and have jurisdiction over minor civil and criminal cases. Regional courts have jurisdiction over more serious cases and can hear appeals from district courts. Courts of appeal are the highest level of common court and can hear appeals from regional courts.\n\n## Military courts\n\nMilitary courts are responsible for hearing cases involving military personnel and have jurisdiction over crimes committed by soldiers and officers. There are two levels of military courts: military district courts and the Military Court of Appeal.\n\n## Supreme Court\n\nThe Supreme Court is the highest court in Poland and has jurisdiction over the most important and complex cases. It can hear appeals from the courts of appeal and has the power to review and overturn decisions made by lower courts. The Supreme Court is also responsible for interpreting the law and providing guidance to lower courts.\n\n## Administrative courts\n\nAdministrative courts are responsible for hearing cases involving the administration of government and public services. They have jurisdiction over cases involving disputes between individuals and government agencies, as well as cases involving the interpretation of administrative law.\n\n## Constitutional Tribunal\n\nThe Constitutional Tribunal is a special court responsible for reviewing the constitutionality of laws and government actions. It has the power to declare laws and government actions unconstitutional, which can have significant implications for the functioning of the government.\n\n## State Tribunal\n\nThe State Tribunal is a special court responsible for hearing cases involving high-ranking government officials, including the President, Prime Minister, and members of the government. It has jurisdiction over cases involving crimes committed by these officials while in office.\n\n# Procedure\n\nThe procedure for hearing cases in Polish courts is governed by the Code of Civil Procedure and the Code of Criminal Procedure. The procedure typically involves several stages, including the filing of a complaint, the investigation of the case, and the hearing of evidence. Cases can be heard by a single judge or a panel of judges, depending on the complexity of the case.\n\n# Staff\n\n## Judges and court assessors\n\nJudges and court assessors are the primary personnel responsible for hearing cases in Polish courts.

The incident sparked a significant diplomatic and military response from the United States and its allies, and raised concerns about the increasing tensions between the United States and China.\n\n#Background\n\n##History and development of reconnaissance balloons\n\nReconnaissance balloons have a long history dating back to the 19th century, when they were used for military surveillance and reconnaissance. The development of high-altitude balloons in the 20th century enabled the collection of signals intelligence and imagery intelligence from altitudes above 30 km. The United States and the Soviet Union developed and used reconnaissance balloons during the Cold War, and China has also developed its own high-altitude balloon capabilities in recent years.\n\n###Past Chinese balloons and unidentified objects\n\nThere have been several reported incidents of Chinese balloons and unidentified objects entering the airspace of other countries in recent years. In 2020, a Chinese balloon was spotted over Japan, and in 2022, a Chinese balloon was detected over the Philippines. The United States has also reported detecting several unidentified objects over its territory in recent years, which some analysts believe may be Chinese reconnaissance balloons.\n\n##U.S.–China tensions\n\nThe 2023 Chinese balloon incident occurred against the backdrop of increasing tensions between the United States and China. The two countries have been engaged in a trade war since 2018, and have also been competing for influence in the Asia-Pacific region. The United States has been critical of China's growing military presence in the region, and has also expressed concerns about China's human rights record and its treatment of minority groups.\n\n#Incident\n\n##Balloon\n\n###Size, propulsion, and payload\n\nThe Chinese balloon that entered U.S. airspace was described as a high-altitude surveillance balloon, approximately 60 meters in length. The balloon was propelled by winds and solar power, and was equipped with a payload that included sensors and cameras.\n\n###Signals intelligence capabilities\n\nThe balloon was reported to have signals intelligence capabilities, which would have allowed it to collect data on U.S. military communications and other sensitive information. The balloon's sensors and cameras would have also been capable of collecting imagery intelligence, including photographs and videos of U.S. military installations and other sensitive sites.\n\n##Detection\n\nThe Chinese balloon was first detected on January 28, 2023, by the U.S. Northern Command, which is responsible for monitoring and defending U.S. airspace. The balloon was initially thought to be a weather balloon, but further analysis revealed that it was a surveillance balloon.\n\n##Flight path\n\nThe balloon entered U.S. airspace over Alaska and flew over several states, including Montana, Wyoming, and South Carolina. The balloon's flight path was tracked by U.S. military aircraft and radar systems, and its movements were closely monitored by U.S. intelligence agencies.\n\n##U.S. monitoring and counterintelligence\n\nThe U.S. government took several steps to monitor and counter the Chinese balloon's surveillance activities. U.S. military aircraft were scrambled to intercept the balloon, and U.S. intelligence agencies worked to disrupt the balloon's communications systems. The U.S. government also notified its allies and partners about the balloon's presence and its potential surveillance activities.\n\n##Downing\n\nOn February 4, 2023, the U.S. military downed the Chinese balloon off the coast of South Carolina, using a Sidewinder missile fired from an F-22 fighter jet. The downing of the balloon was widely reported in the media, and sparked a significant diplomatic and military response from China.\n\n##Debris recovery\n\nThe U.S. military recovered the debris from the downed balloon, which was taken to a U.S. naval base for analysis. The debris was reported to include sensors, cameras, and other equipment, which were analyzed by U.S. intelligence agencies to determine the balloon's surveillance capabilities.\n\n#Legality of airspace and downing\n\nThe legality of the Chinese balloon's presence in U.S. airspace and the U.S. military's decision to down the balloon have been the subject of controversy and debate. The United States and China have different interpretations of international law regarding the use of airspace and the conduct of surveillance activities.\n\n#Response and reactions\n\n##United States\n\nThe U.S. government condemned the Chinese balloon's presence in U.S. airspace and the balloon's surveillance activities. The U.S. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, cancelled a planned visit to China, citing the balloon incident as the reason. The U.S. military also took steps to increase its surveillance and defense capabilities, including deploying additional aircraft and radar systems to monitor U.S. airspace.\n\n##Canada\n\nThe Canadian government also condemned the Chinese balloon's presence in Canadian airspace and the balloon's surveillance activities. The Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, called the incident \"unacceptable\" and said that Canada would take steps to protect its sovereignty and security.\n\n##China\n\nThe Chinese government denied that the balloon was a surveillance balloon, claiming that it was a civilian airship that had strayed off course. The Chinese government also accused the U.S. government of overreacting and of violating China's sovereignty.\n\n##NATO\n\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) condemned the Chinese balloon's presence in U.S. airspace and the balloon's surveillance activities. The NATO Secretary-General, Jens Stoltenberg, said that the incident was a \"serious challenge\" to the security of NATO member countries.\n\n##Australia\n\nThe Australian government condemned the Chinese balloon's presence in U.S. airspace and the balloon's surveillance activities. The Australian Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, said that the incident was a \"serious concern\" for Australia and its allies.\n\n##Japan\n\nThe Japanese government condemned the Chinese balloon's presence in U.S. airspace and the balloon's surveillance activities. The Japanese Prime Minister, Fumio Kishida, said that the incident was a \"serious challenge\" to the security of Japan and its allies.\n\n##Singapore\n\nThe Singaporean government condemned the Chinese balloon's presence in U.S. airspace and the balloon's surveillance activities. The Singaporean Prime Minister, Lee Hsien Loong, said that the incident was a \"serious concern\" for Singapore and its allies.\n\n##United Kingdom\n\nThe British government condemned the Chinese balloon's presence in U.S. airspace and the balloon's surveillance activities. The British Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, said that the incident was a \"serious challenge\" to the security of the United Kingdom and its allies.\n\n##Venezuela\n\nThe Venezuelan government supported China's position on the balloon incident, claiming that the balloon was a civilian airship that had strayed off course. The Venezuelan President, Nicolás Maduro, accused the U.S. government of \"aggression\" against China.\n\n##Media reactions\n\nThe media reaction to the Chinese balloon incident was widespread and varied. Many news outlets reported on the incident and its implications for U.S.-China relations and global security.\n\n###Analysis\n\nMany analysts and experts commented on the implications of the Chinese balloon incident, including its potential impact on U.S.-China relations and global security. Some analysts noted that the incident was a \"wake-up call\" for the United States and its allies, highlighting the need for greater vigilance and cooperation in the face of growing Chinese military power.\n\n###Satire\n\nThe Chinese balloon incident was also the subject of satire and humor, with many comedians and commentators poking fun at the incident and its absurdity. Some commentators noted that the incident was a \"laughable\" example of Chinese espionage, while others joked about the U.S. military's decision to down the balloon.\n\n#Other high-altitude objects in February 2023\n\nIn the days and weeks following the Chinese balloon incident, several other high-altitude objects were detected and tracked by U.S. military and intelligence agencies. Some of these objects were identified as balloons or drones, while others remained unidentified.\n\n#Additional assessments of the balloon\n\nThe U.S. government and its allies conducted a thorough assessment of the Chinese balloon and its surveillance capabilities. The assessment was based on the analysis of debris from the downed balloon, as well as intelligence gathered from other sources.\n\n#See also\n\n* List of Chinese espionage incidents in the United States\n* List of balloon-borne surveillance systems\n* List of high-altitude surveillance systems\n\n#Notes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Chinese_balloon_incident\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##History and development of reconnaissance balloons\n###Past Chinese balloons and unidentified objects\n##U.S.–China tensions\n#Incident\n##Balloon\n###Size, propulsion, and payload\n###Signals intelligence capabilities\n##Detection\n##Flight path\n##U.S. monitoring and counterintelligence\n##Downing\n##Debris recovery\n#Legality of airspace and downing\n#Response and reactions\n##United States\n##Canada\n##China\n##NATO\n##Australia\n##Japan\n##Singapore\n##United Kingdom\n##Venezuela\n##Media reactions\n###Analysis\n###Satire\n#Other high-altitude objects in February 2023\n#Additional assessments of the balloon\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The team is controlled by the Royal Moroccan Football Federation and represents the country in international football competitions. Morocco has a rich football history, and the team has been a major force in African football for several decades.\n\n# History\n\n## Pre-independence period\n\nThe first Moroccan national team was formed in 1928, while the country was still a French protectorate. During this period, the team played several friendly matches against French teams and other North African countries. The team's early success was marked by a 6-0 victory over Algeria in 1931.\n\n## Beginning of Morocco (1955–1963)\n\nAfter gaining independence in 1956, Morocco became a member of FIFA and the African Football Confederation (CAF). The team's first official match was against Iraq in 1957, which ended in a 3-3 draw. In the early 1960s, Morocco participated in several international tournaments, including the African Cup of Nations and the Mediterranean Games.\n\n## First appearances in international competitions (1963–1976)\n\nMorocco's first appearance in the African Cup of Nations was in 1963, where they were eliminated in the group stage. The team's first major success came in 1972, when they won the African Cup of Nations, defeating Mali 3-2 in the final. Morocco also participated in the 1970 World Cup qualifiers, but failed to qualify for the tournament.\n\n## Between successes and defeats (1976–1986)\n\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, Morocco experienced a period of transition, with several changes in coaching staff and player personnel. The team failed to qualify for the 1978 and 1982 World Cups, but won the African Cup of Nations again in 1976, defeating Guinea 1-0 in the final.\n\n## Golden generation (1986–2000)\n\nThe late 1980s and 1990s are considered the golden era of Moroccan football. The team, led by players such as Aziz Bouderbala and Mustapha Hadji, qualified for the 1986 and 1998 World Cups, where they were eliminated in the group stage. Morocco also won the African Cup of Nations in 1992, defeating Senegal 2-0 in the final.\n\n## Difficult years (2006–2017)\n\nAfter the retirement of several key players, Morocco experienced a decline in performance, failing to qualify for the 2010 and 2014 World Cups. The team also failed to advance past the group stage in several African Cup of Nations tournaments.\n\n## Second golden generation (2017–present)\n\nIn recent years, Morocco has experienced a resurgence in football, led by a new generation of players such as Hakim Ziyech and Achraf Hakimi. The team qualified for the 2018 World Cup, where they were eliminated in the group stage, and won the African Nations Championship in 2018, defeating Nigeria 4-0 in the final.\n\n# Home stadium\n\nThe Morocco national team plays its home matches at the Stade Mohammed V in Casablanca, which has a capacity of over 45,000 spectators. The stadium has hosted several international tournaments, including the African Cup of Nations and the FIFA Club World Cup.\n\n# Kit suppliers\n\nThe Morocco national team's kit supplier is Puma, which has been the team's official kit supplier since 2019.\n\n# Results and fixtures\n\n## 2023\n\n* January 13: Morocco vs. Ghana (African Cup of Nations)\n* January 17: Morocco vs. Comoros (African Cup of Nations)\n* January 21: Morocco vs. Gabon (African Cup of Nations)\n\n## 2024\n\n* March 20: Morocco vs. Burkina Faso (African Cup of Nations qualifiers)\n* March 28: Morocco vs. Burkina Faso (African Cup of Nations qualifiers)\n\n# Coaching staff\n\n## Coaching history\n\n* 1957-1961: Larbi Ben Barek\n* 1961-1963: Mohamed Massoun\n* 1963-1964: Abderrahmane Mahjoub\n* 1964-1967: Mohamed Massoun\n* 1967-1968: Abderrahmane Mahjoub\n* 1968-1970: Guy Cluzeau\n* 1970-1973: Abderrahmane Mahjoub\n* 1973-1975: Virgil Mărdărescu\n* 1975-1978: Abdellah Blinda\n* 1978-1980: Just Fontaine\n* 1980-1981: Yabram Hamidouch\n* 1981-1982: Abdellah Blinda\n* 1982-1984: Jaime Valente\n* 1984-1986: José Faria\n* 1986-1988: José Vieira\n* 1988-1990: Antonio Valentim\n* 1990-1992: Werner Olk\n* 1992-1993: Abdellah Blinda\n* 1993-1994: Mohammed Lamari\n* 1994-1996: Badou Zaki\n* 1996-1998: Henry Depireux\n* 1998-2000: Badou Zaki\n* 2000-2001: Henri Michel\n* 2001-2002: Mustapha Madih\n* 2002-2004: Badou Zaki\n* 2004-2005: Philippe Troussier\n* 2005-2007: Mohammed Fakhir\n* 2007-2008: Henri Michel\n* 2008-2010: Roger Lemerre\n* 2010-2012: Eric Gerets\n* 2012-2013: Rachid Taoussi\n* 2013-2014: Hassan Benabicha\n* 2014-2016: Badou Zaki\n* 2016-2019: Hervé Renard\n* 2019-present: Vahid Halilhodžić\n\n# Players\n\n## Current squad\n\n* Goalkeepers: Yassine Bounou, Munir Mohamedi, Ahmed Reda Tagnaouti\n* Defenders: Achraf Hakimi, Medhi Benatia, Romain Saïss, Sofyan Amrabat, Noussair Mazraoui\n* Midfielders: Hakim Ziyech, Amine Harit, Younès Belhanda, Adel Taarabt, Mehdi Carcela\n* Forwards: Youssef En-Nesyri, Munir El Haddadi, Sofiane Boufal, Ryan Mmaee\n\n## Recent call-ups\n\n* Goalkeepers: Abdelali Mhamdi, Azzedine Ounahi\n* Defenders: Samy Mmaee, Omar El Kaddouri\n* Midfielders: Fayçal Fajr, Mehdi Oubila\n* Forwards: Ayoub El Kaabi, Soufiane Rahimi\n\n## Previous squads\n\n* 1986 FIFA World Cup: Ezzaki Badou, Mohammed Sahil, Lahcen Ouadani, Mustapha El Biyaz, Noureddine Bouyahyaoui, Abdelmajid Dolmy, Aziz Bouderbala, Fathallah Lachhab, Saïd Kaddouri, Mustapha Merry, Mohammed Timoumi, Abdellah Bidane, Mustapha El Haddaoui, Abderrazak Khairi, Hassan Hanini, Mustapha El Idrissi\n* 1998 FIFA World Cup: Mustapha Chadili, Driss Benzekri, Abdelilah Saber, Youssef Rossi, Smahi Triki, Noureddine Naybet, Tahar El Khalej, Saïd Chiba, Mustapha Hadji, Rachid Azzouzi, Ali El Khattabi, Rachid Neqrouz, Lahcen Abrami, Youssef Fertout, Abdelmajid Bouyboud, Mustapha Khalif, Youssef Chippo\n\n# Player records\n\n## Most appearances\n\n* 1.

The movie follows the story of a retired cop who is forced to take up his duties once again to uncover the truth behind a mysterious case.\n\nPlot\n-----\n\nThe movie begins with the introduction of Christopher, a retired police officer who has been living a peaceful life with his family. However, his quiet life is disrupted when he is approached by a young woman named Beena, who seeks his help in investigating the mysterious disappearance of her sister. Initially hesitant, Christopher is eventually drawn into the case and starts to unravel the truth behind the disappearance.\n\nAs Christopher delves deeper into the case, he discovers that it is linked to a larger conspiracy involving corrupt government officials and businessmen. Despite facing numerous obstacles and threats, Christopher remains determined to uncover the truth and bring justice to the victims. Along the way, he is aided by a team of trusted allies, including his former colleagues and a few unexpected friends.\n\nThroughout the movie, Christopher's past as a police officer is gradually revealed through a series of flashbacks. These flashbacks provide insight into his motivations and the events that led him to retire from the police force. The movie's climax features an intense confrontation between Christopher and the masterminds behind the conspiracy, leading to a thrilling conclusion.\n\nCast\n-----\n\n* Mammootty as Christopher\n* Amala Paul as Beena\n* Sneha as Advocate Renjitha\n* Aishwarya Lekshmi as Maria\n* Dileesh Pothan as Advocate Sreekumar\n* Vinay Rai as Dr. Sreekumar\n* Siddique as DIG Chandran\n* Jinu Joseph as PC Rakesh\n* Rajesh Sharma as CPO Kaimal\n\nProduction\n------------\n\nThe movie was announced in 2022 with Mammootty attached to play the lead role.

In Alberta, Canada, the issue of orphan wells has become a significant concern due to the large number of wells that have been abandoned over the years. This article provides an overview of the current situation, context, and responses to the issue of orphan wells in Alberta.\n\n# Current Overview\n\nAs of 2022, there are approximately 170,000 inactive oil and gas wells in Alberta, with around 12,000 of those considered orphan wells. The number of orphan wells has been increasing over the years due to a combination of factors, including the decline of the oil and gas industry, company bankruptcies, and changes in regulatory requirements. The Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) is responsible for overseeing the cleanup and abandonment of oil and gas wells in the province, but the agency has faced challenges in addressing the growing number of orphan wells.\n\n# Context\n\nThe oil and gas industry has been a significant contributor to Alberta's economy for decades. However, the industry has also left behind a legacy of environmental liabilities, including abandoned wells. In the past, companies were not always required to properly abandon and reclaim their wells, leading to a buildup of orphan wells across the province. The decline of the oil and gas industry in recent years has exacerbated the problem, as companies have gone bankrupt or abandoned their operations, leaving behind a trail of orphan wells.\n\n# Landowners and Municipalities\n\nLandowners and municipalities in Alberta have been impacted by the presence of orphan wells on their properties. Many landowners have reported finding abandoned wells on their land, which can pose safety risks and decrease property values. Municipalities have also been affected, as they are often left to deal with the costs and liabilities associated with orphan wells. Some municipalities have reported spending significant amounts of money to clean up and abandon orphan wells, which can be a burden on local taxpayers.\n\n# Orphan Well Association\n\nThe Orphan Well Association (OWA) is a non-profit organization established in 2002 to manage and clean up orphan wells in Alberta. The OWA is funded by industry and government, and works with the AER and other stakeholders to prioritize and address the cleanup of orphan wells. The OWA has made significant progress in recent years, having cleaned up over 1,000 orphan wells since its inception.\n\n# OWA Funding\n\n## Federal and Provincial Subsidies\n\nThe OWA receives funding from both the federal and provincial governments, as well as from industry. In 2020, the federal government announced a $1 billion fund to support the cleanup of orphan wells across Canada, with a significant portion of that funding allocated to Alberta. The provincial government has also provided funding to the OWA, recognizing the importance of addressing the issue of orphan wells.\n\n# Alberta Energy Regulator\n\nThe AER is the primary regulator of the oil and gas industry in Alberta, and is responsible for overseeing the cleanup and abandonment of oil and gas wells. The AER has implemented a number of measures to address the issue of orphan wells, including increasing funding to the OWA and implementing new regulations to prevent the creation of new orphan wells.\n\n# Legal and Regulatory Considerations\n\n## Polluter Pays Principle\n\nThe polluter pays principle is a fundamental concept in environmental law, which holds that those responsible for environmental pollution or damage should be held accountable for the costs of cleanup and remediation. In the case of orphan wells, the polluter pays principle is often difficult to apply, as the companies responsible for the wells may have gone bankrupt or ceased to exist.\n\n## Suspended Inactive Wells\n\nSuspended inactive wells are wells that have been temporarily abandoned, but not properly reclaimed. These wells can pose significant environmental risks, as they may be leaking fluids or gases into the environment. The AER has implemented regulations to require companies to properly abandon and reclaim suspended inactive wells, but many of these wells remain in a state of limbo.\n\n# Bankruptcies and Orphan Wells\n\n## Strategic Packaging of Costly Liabilities with Productive Assets\n\nIn some cases, companies have strategically packaged costly liabilities, such as orphan wells, with productive assets, such as operating wells or pipelines. This can make it difficult for regulators to address the issue of orphan wells, as the companies may argue that the productive assets should be prioritized over the cleanup of orphan wells.\n\n# Environmental Impacts of Orphan Wells\n\n## Fugitive Gas Emissions\n\nOrphan wells can be a significant source of fugitive gas emissions, which contribute to climate change. In Alberta, it is estimated that orphan wells are responsible for around 10% of the province's total fugitive gas emissions.\n\n## Surface Casing Vent Flow (SCVF) and Gas Migration (GM)\n\nSCVF and GM are two types of environmental hazards associated with orphan wells. SCVF occurs when fluids or gases leak from the well casing and flow to the surface, while GM occurs when gases migrate from the well to the surrounding soil or rock. Both of these hazards can pose significant environmental risks, including contamination of soil and groundwater.\n\n# Potential Geothermal Conversion of Orphan Wells in Alberta\n\nSome researchers have proposed converting orphan wells into geothermal energy production, which could provide a new source of renewable energy while also addressing the issue of orphan wells.

The crisis began with the collapse of several mid-sized banks, including Silvergate Bank, Silicon Valley Bank, and Signature Bank, and later spread to larger institutions, including First Republic Bank. The crisis was triggered by a combination of factors, including rising interest rates, liquidity issues, and a decline in the value of assets held by banks.\n\n#Background\n\nThe 2023 United States banking crisis was the result of a combination of factors that created a perfect storm of financial instability. One of the main causes was the rapid increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve, which made it more expensive for banks to borrow money and led to a decrease in the value of assets held by banks. Additionally, many banks had invested heavily in long-term assets, such as mortgage-backed securities, which lost value as interest rates rose.\n\nAnother factor contributing to the crisis was the decline of the tech industry, which had a significant impact on the banks that served the industry. Many tech companies had deposited large amounts of money in banks, which were then used to fund investments in the tech sector. However, as the tech industry declined, these deposits were withdrawn, leaving banks with a liquidity crisis.\n\n#Liquidation of Silvergate Bank\n\n##Background\n\nSilvergate Bank was a mid-sized bank based in California that specialized in serving the crypto industry. The bank had grown rapidly in recent years, driven by the boom in cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. However, as the crypto market declined, Silvergate Bank found itself with a large portfolio of assets that were rapidly losing value.\n\n##Events\n\nOn March 8, 2023, Silvergate Bank announced that it would be winding down its operations and liquidating its assets. The bank had been struggling to meet its liquidity needs, and the decision to liquidate was seen as a last resort. The liquidation of Silvergate Bank was the first major bank failure of the 2023 crisis, and it sent shockwaves through the financial markets.\n\n#Collapse of Silicon Valley Bank\n\n##Background\n\nSilicon Valley Bank was a mid-sized bank based in California that specialized in serving the tech industry. The bank had grown rapidly in recent years, driven by the boom in tech startups. However, as the tech industry declined, Silicon Valley Bank found itself with a large portfolio of assets that were rapidly losing value.\n\n##Events\n\nOn March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank announced that it would be seeking a buyer or investor to help it meet its liquidity needs. However, after a failed attempt to raise capital, the bank was placed into receivership by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank was the second major bank failure of the 2023 crisis, and it had a significant impact on the tech industry.\n\n#Collapse of Signature Bank\n\n##Background\n\nSignature Bank was a mid-sized bank based in New York that specialized in serving the real estate industry. The bank had grown rapidly in recent years, driven by the boom in real estate prices. However, as interest rates rose, Signature Bank found itself with a large portfolio of assets that were rapidly losing value.\n\n##Events\n\nOn March 12, 2023, Signature Bank was taken over by the FDIC after it failed to meet its liquidity needs. The bank had been struggling to meet its obligations, and the decision to take it over was seen as a last resort. The collapse of Signature Bank was the third major bank failure of the 2023 crisis, and it had a significant impact on the real estate industry.\n\n#Collapse of First Republic Bank\n\n##Background\n\nFirst Republic Bank was a mid-sized bank based in California that specialized in serving the private banking needs of high net worth individuals. The bank had grown rapidly in recent years, driven by the boom in wealth creation. However, as interest rates rose, First Republic Bank found itself with a large portfolio of assets that were rapidly losing value.\n\n##Events\n\nOn April 1, 2023, First Republic Bank announced that it would be seeking a buyer or investor to help it meet its liquidity needs. However, after a failed attempt to raise capital, the bank was taken over by JPMorgan Chase. The collapse of First Republic Bank was the fourth major bank failure of the 2023 crisis, and it had a significant impact on the private banking industry.\n\n#Aftermath\n\n##Bank Term Funding Program\n\nIn response to the crisis, the Federal Reserve announced the creation of the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP), a new lending facility designed to provide liquidity to banks. The BTFP allowed banks to borrow money from the Fed for up to one year, using a wide range of assets as collateral. The program was seen as a key measure to stabilize the banking system and prevent further bank failures.\n\n##Government discussion of other funding\n\nIn addition to the BTFP, the government discussed other measures to provide funding to banks, including a potential bailout package. However, the idea of a bailout was met with skepticism by lawmakers, who were concerned about the potential cost to taxpayers.\n\n##U.S. investigations\n\nThe 2023 banking crisis led to a number of investigations by U.S. regulators, including the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The investigations focused on the causes of the crisis, including the role of bank management and the impact of regulatory failures.\n\n##Economic impact\n\nThe 2023 banking crisis had a significant impact on the U.S. economy, including a decline in economic growth and a rise in unemployment. The crisis also led to a decline in the value of assets held by banks, including stocks and bonds.\n\n##International impact\n\nThe 2023 banking crisis also had an impact on the global economy, including a decline in economic growth and a rise in financial instability. The crisis led to a decline in the value of assets held by banks around the world, including stocks and bonds.\n\n#See also\n\n* 2008 financial crisis\n* Banking regulation\n* Financial instability\n* Bank failure\n* Liquidity crisis", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_United_States_banking_crisis\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Liquidation of Silvergate Bank\n##Background\n##Events\n#Collapse of Silicon Valley Bank\n##Background\n##Events\n#Collapse of Signature Bank\n##Background\n##Events\n#Collapse of First Republic Bank\n##Background\n##Events\n#Aftermath\n##Bank Term Funding Program\n##Government discussion of other funding\n##U.S. investigations\n##Economic impact\n##International impact\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born and raised in Punjab, India, Amritpal rose to fame after taking over as the head of Waris Punjab De following the death of its founder, Deep Sidhu. His activism and campaigning have been marked by controversy, with some hailing him as a champion of Sikh rights and others criticizing his methods and ideology.\n\nEarly life\n\nAmritpal Singh was born in 1993 in the village of Jallupur Khera, Amritsar district, Punjab, India. Little is known about his family or early life, but it is reported that he comes from a humble farming background. Amritpal received his primary education in his village and later moved to Amritsar for further studies. He became interested in Sikh activism and politics from an early age and was influenced by the ideology of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, a prominent Sikh leader who played a key role in the Khalistan movement.\n\nWaris Punjab De\n\n### Succession to Deep Sidhu\n\nAmritpal Singh's rise to prominence began after the death of Deep Sidhu, the founder of Waris Punjab De, in February 2022. Deep Sidhu was a popular Sikh activist and actor who had founded Waris Punjab De as a social and cultural organization aimed at promoting Sikh values and interests. Following his death, Amritpal was chosen as his successor, reportedly due to his close association with Deep Sidhu and his shared ideology.\n\n### Campaigning and Prachaar\n\nUnder Amritpal's leadership, Waris Punjab De launched a series of campaigns and programs aimed at promoting Sikh activism and awareness. Amritpal traveled extensively throughout Punjab, addressing rallies and meetings, and using social media to spread his message. His activism focused on issues such as Sikh identity, human rights, and social justice, and he quickly gained a large following among Sikh youth.\n\n### Drug rehabilitation\n\nOne of Amritpal's key initiatives was a campaign against drug addiction, which he launched in response to the growing problem of substance abuse in Punjab. He established a network of rehabilitation centers and counseling services, and worked with local communities to raise awareness about the dangers of addiction.\n\n### Early controversies\n\nDespite his popularity, Amritpal's activism was not without controversy. He was criticized by some for his confrontational approach and his use of inflammatory language, which some saw as divisive and extremist. Amritpal was also accused of promoting a narrow and exclusivist form of Sikh identity, which some argued was at odds with the principles of Sikhism.\n\n### Khalistan and Bhindranwale styling\n\nAmritpal's ideology and activism have been influenced by the Khalistan movement, a separatist movement that seeks to establish an independent Sikh state. He has often spoken about the need for Sikh self-determination and the right to autonomy, and has been criticized for his glorification of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, who is seen by some as a militant and extremist leader. Amritpal's styling and iconography have also been compared to Bhindranwale's, with some accusing him of seeking to emulate the latter's image and ideology.\n\nPolitical career\n\n### Member of Parliament\n\nIn 2022, Amritpal Singh announced his intention to contest the Indian general election as a candidate for the Shiromani Akali Dal (Amritsar) party. However, his candidacy was rejected by the Election Commission of India, reportedly due to his involvement in a criminal case.\n\nParticipation in violence\n\n### Ajnala clash\n\nIn February 2023, Amritpal Singh was involved in a violent clash with police in Ajnala, Punjab, which left several people injured and led to widespread condemnation. The clash occurred when Amritpal and his supporters attempted to storm a police station to free a fellow activist who had been arrested. The incident was widely criticized, with many accusing Amritpal of inciting violence and lawlessness.\n\nCrackdown and arrest\n\n### Allegations and charges\n\nIn the wake of the Ajnala clash, the Punjab police launched a crackdown on Amritpal Singh and his supporters, arresting several dozen people on charges of rioting, assault, and conspiracy. Amritpal himself went into hiding, but was eventually arrested on March 18, 2023, in a village in Moga district. He was charged with several offenses, including sedition, rioting, and promoting enmity between different groups.\n\n### Reactions\n\n#### Domestic\n\nThe crackdown on Amritpal Singh and his supporters was widely condemned by opposition parties and human rights groups, who accused the government of suppressing dissent and targeting Sikh activists. The Shiromani Akali Dal (Amritsar) party, which had supported Amritpal's candidacy, denounced the arrest as \"unlawful\" and \"undemocratic\".\n\n#### International\n\nThe international community also reacted to Amritpal's arrest, with several human rights organizations expressing concern about the use of force and the targeting of minority groups. The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) condemned the arrest, saying it was \"deeply concerned\" about the treatment of Sikh activists and the suppression of dissent.\n\nPersonal life\n\nLittle is known about Amritpal Singh's personal life, but it is reported that he is unmarried and comes from a humble farming background. He is known to be a devout Sikh and has been influenced by the ideology of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale.\n\nSee also\n\n* Deep Sidhu\n* Waris Punjab De\n* Khalistan movement\n* Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale\n* Shiromani Akali Dal (Amritsar)\n\nNotes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Amritpal_Singh\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n#Waris Punjab De\n##Succession to Deep Sidhu\n##Campaigning and Prachaar\n##Drug rehabilitation\n##Early controversies\n##Khalistan and Bhindranwale styling\n#Political career\n##Member of Parliament\n#Participation in violence\n##Ajnala clash\n#Crackdown and arrest\n##Allegations and charges\n##Reactions\n###Domestic\n###International\n#Personal life\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

They are trying to keep a low profile, but their peaceful life is disrupted when a group of dinosaurs escapes from a nearby sanctuary.\n\nMeanwhile, Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill), Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), and Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) are brought together by a wealthy tech mogul, Lewis Dodgson (Campbell Scott), who is the CEO of Biosyn, a biotech company. Dodgson wants their help in dealing with a new threat: giant prehistoric locusts that are destroying crops and threatening global food supplies.\n\nAs the story unfolds, Owen and Claire team up with the original Jurassic Park trio to take down the locusts and stop Biosyn's nefarious plans.

Throughout his career, Pintilie played a significant role in shaping the country's security apparatus and implementing policies that led to widespread human rights abuses.\n\n# Biography\n\n## Youth and imprisonment\n\nGheorghe Pintilie was born on February 9, 1902, in the village of Ștefănești, Argeș County, Romania. His early life was marked by poverty and hardship, which eventually led him to join the Romanian Communist Party in 1924. During the interwar period, Pintilie was involved in various communist activities, including organizing strikes and distributing propaganda materials. His activism attracted the attention of the authorities, and he was arrested and imprisoned several times.\n\n## Communist rise\n\nAfter World War II, Pintilie's communist affiliations propelled him to prominence within the party. He quickly rose through the ranks, becoming a key figure in the Communist Party's efforts to consolidate power in post-war Romania. In 1945, Pintilie was appointed as the head of the party's organizational department, where he played a crucial role in recruiting new members and establishing a network of informants.\n\n## DGSP creation\n\nIn 1948, the Communist Party of Romania established the General Directorate for State Security (DGSP), a secret police agency modeled after the Soviet Union's NKVD. Pintilie was appointed as the first director of the DGSP, a position that gave him significant control over the country's security apparatus. Under his leadership, the DGSP was responsible for suppressing opposition to the communist regime, monitoring the activities of dissidents, and enforcing ideological conformity.\n\n## Pushing for atrocities\n\nDuring his tenure as DGSP director, Pintilie played a sig", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Gheorghe_Pintilie\" following this outline:\n\n#Biography\n##Youth and imprisonment\n##Communist rise\n##DGSP creation\n##Pushing for atrocities\n##Brainwashing experiment\n##In the power struggles\n##Political isolation\n##Downfall\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is the capital of the Tartus Governorate and has a population of around 500,000 people. Tartus has a rich history dating back to the Phoenician era and has been an important center of trade and commerce for centuries.\n\nEtymology\n------------\n\nThe name \"Tartus\" is derived from the Phoenician word \"Antaradus,\" which refers to the island of Arwad, located just off the coast of the city. Over time, the name evolved into \"Tartus,\" which has been used to refer to the city since the Byzantine era.\n\nHistory\n-----------\n\n### Phoenician Antaradus\n\nThe city of Tartus was founded by the Phoenicians in the 2nd millennium BC, who established it as a major trading post and commercial center. The Phoenicians named the city \"Antaradus,\" which was an important stopover for merchants and traders traveling between the eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East. During this period, the city was a major center for the production of purple dye, which was highly prized in ancient times.\n\n### Greco-Roman and Byzantine era\n\nFollowing the conquest of the Phoenicians by Alexander the Great in the 4th century BC, Tartus became a part of the Greco-Roman world. During this period, the city was an important center of culture and learning, and was home to a number of prominent philosophers and scholars. With the rise of Christianity, Tartus became an important center of the faith, and was the seat of a bishopric.\n\n### Early Islamic era\n\nIn the 7th century AD, Tartus was conquered by the Arabs, who brought Islam to the region. During this period, the city continued to be an important center of trade and commerce, and was a major stopover for merchants and traders traveling between the Middle East and North Africa.\n\n### Crusades\n\nIn the 12th century AD, Tartus was captured by the Crusaders, who established it as a major base for their military campaigns in the region. During this period, the city was heavily fortified, and a number of castles and fortifications were built.\n\n### Ottoman era\n\nIn the 16th century AD, Tartus was conquered by the Ottomans, who ruled the city for nearly 400 years. During this period, the city continued to be an important center of trade and commerce, and was a major center for the production of textiles and other goods.\n\n### Modern era\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, Tartus was mandated to France by the League of Nations, and became part of the French Mandate for Syria and Lebanon.

The violence has resulted in significant loss of life, displacement of people, and widespread destruction of property. The roots of the conflict are complex and multifaceted, involving issues of identity, politics, and external influences.\n\n# Background\n\n## Scheduled Tribe status for Meitei\n\nOne of the key factors contributing to the violence in Manipur is the demand for Scheduled Tribe (ST) status for the Meitei community. The Meitei are the dominant ethnic group in Manipur, making up approximately 53% of the state's population. However, they are not currently recognized as a Scheduled Tribe, which would provide them with certain constitutional protections and benefits. The demand for ST status has been a longstanding issue in Manipur, with many Meitei organizations and politicians arguing that it is necessary to protect the community's rights and interests.\n\n## Political background\n\nPolitics has also played a significant role in the violence in Manipur. The state has a long history of insurgency and militancy, with various groups fighting for independence or greater autonomy. In recent years, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been in power in Manipur, which has led to tensions with other parties and groups. The BJP's policies and actions have been seen as favoring certain communities over others, which has contributed to the current violence.\n\n## Refugees from Myanmar\n\nThe influx of refugees from Myanmar has also been a factor in the violence in Manipur. In recent years, thousands of people have fled Myanmar due to conflict and persecution, many of whom have sought refuge in Manipur. This has put a strain on the state's resources and infrastructure, and has led to tensions between local communities and the refugees.\n\n## International factors\n\nInternational factors have also played a role in the violence in Manipur. The state's location on the border with Myanmar makes it vulnerable to external influences and interference. Additionally, the Indian government's policies towards Myanmar and its Rohingya Muslim minority have been seen as contributing to the violence in Manipur.\n\n# Antecedents\n\nThe violence in Manipur did not occur in a vacuum. There were several antecedents that contributed to the current situation. In 2015, the Indian government signed the Naga Peace Accord with the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN), a militant group that has been fighting for Naga independence. The accord was seen as a major breakthrough, but it also created tensions with other groups in Manipur who felt that their interests were not being represented. In 2020, the BJP government in Manipur introduced a new bill that would allow non-Manipuris to settle in the state, which was seen as a threat to the rights and interests of local communities.\n\n# Overview\n\n## Initial riots\n\nThe violence in Manipur began in May 2023, when a group of Meitei students clashed with a group of Kuki (a tribal community) students in Imphal, the state capital. The clashes quickly escalated, with both sides accusing each other of violence and aggression. The police were unable to control the situation, and soon the violence had spread to other parts of the state.\n\n## Government response\n\nThe government's response to the violence has been criticized as inadequate and biased. The BJP government in Manipur has been accused of favoring the Meitei community and ignoring the concerns of other groups. The police have been accused of using excessive force against protesters and of failing to protect people from violence.\n\n## Recurrent violence\n\nThe violence in Manipur has been recurrent, with clashes breaking out on a regular basis. In June 2023, a group of Kuki militants attacked a Meitei village, killing several people and destroying homes. In July 2023, a group of Meitei militiamen attacked a Kuki village, killing several people and displacing hundreds. The violence has continued unabated, with both sides accusing each other of aggression and violence.\n\n## Warring groups\n\nThere are several warring groups involved in the violence in Manipur, including the Meitei and Kuki communities. Other groups, such as the Nagas and the Pangals ( Manipuri Muslims), have also been caught up in the violence. The groups have been clashing over issues of identity, territory, and resources.\n\n## Casualties and victims\n\nThe violence in Manipur has resulted in significant casualties and displacement. According to official figures, over 100 people have been killed and over 1,000 injured. Thousands of people have been displaced, with many forced to flee their homes and seek shelter in relief camps.\n\n# Supreme Court proceedings\n\nThe Supreme Court of India has taken suo motu cognizance of the violence in Manipur and has ordered the state government to take steps to protect people's rights and interests. The court has also appointed a special committee to investigate the violence and recommend measures to prevent further clashes.\n\n# Reactions\n\nThe violence in Manipur has been widely condemned by civil society organizations, opposition parties, and international human rights groups. The Indian government has been criticized for its handling of the situation, with many calling for greater action to protect people's rights and interests.\n\n# Media coverage\n\nThe media coverage of the violence in Manipur has been criticized as biased and inadequate. Many media outlets have been accused of ignoring the concerns of marginalized communities and of failing to provide accurate and balanced reporting.\n\n# See also\n\n* Ethnic conflict in Manipur\n* Insurgency in Northeast India\n* Rohingya refugee crisis\n* Naga Peace Accord\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a factual report on the 2023–2024 Manipur violence.

The opera is based on a Swedish ballad of the same name, and its premiere took place on November 7, 1896, at the Royal Swedish Opera in Stockholm. Despite its initial success, the opera was eventually withdrawn from the repertoire and remained largely forgotten until its revival in the 1980s.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\n### Composition\n\nSibelius began working on The Maiden in the Tower in 1895, during a period of intense creativity and experimentation. He was drawn to the Swedish ballad, which tells the story of a maiden imprisoned in a tower and her ultimate rescue by a prince. Sibelius saw great potential in the story and set to work on the opera, pouring his emotions and ideas into the music. The composition process was not without its challenges, however, as Sibelius struggled to balance his artistic vision with the demands of the libretto.\n\n### Premiere\n\nThe premiere of The Maiden in the Tower took place on November 7, 1896, at the Royal Swedish Opera in Stockholm. The production was a major event, with many of Stockholm's high society in attendance. The opera received generally positive reviews, with critics praising Sibelius's score and the performances of the cast. However, not all reviews were glowing, and some critics expressed reservations about the opera's dramatic structure and character development.\n\n### Withdrawal and suppression\n\nDespite its initial success, The Maiden in the Tower was eventually withdrawn from the repertoire. The reasons for this are complex and multifaceted, but they are largely related to the opera's association with the Swedish language and culture. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Finland was experiencing a period of intense nationalism and language strife. Many Finns saw Swedish as the language of the ruling class, and there was a growing movement to promote the use of Finnish as the primary language of the country.\n\nAs a result of these tensions, many of Sibelius's works, including The Maiden in the Tower, were seen as being too closely associated with Swedish culture. The opera was eventually dropped from the repertoire, and it remained largely forgotten for many years.\n\n### Posthumous revival\n\nIn the 1980s, there was a renewed interest in Sibelius's music, and The Maiden in the Tower was rediscovered and revived. The opera has since been performed numerous times, both in Finland and abroad, and it is now recognized as an important part of Sibelius's oeuvre.\n\nStructure and roles\n-------------------\n\nThe Maiden in the Tower is an opera in one act, with a libretto by Rafael Hertzberg. The opera tells the story of a maiden imprisoned in a tower and her ultimate rescue by a prince. The main characters include:\n\n* The Maiden: the protagonist of the opera, a young woman imprisoned in a tower\n* The Prince: the hero of the opera, who rescues the maiden from the tower\n* The Mother: the maiden's mother, who appears in a vision to her daughter\n* The Servant: a minor character who serves the mother and provides comic relief\n\nSynopsis\n--------\n\nThe opera begins with the maiden imprisoned in the tower, where she has been locked away by her wicked stepmother. The maiden sings of her longing for freedom and her hopes of being rescued. The prince appears, and the two fall in love. However, their happiness is short-lived, as the stepmother appears and tries to prevent their union.\n\nThe mother appears in a vision to the maiden, and the two sing a beautiful duet. The servant appears, and provides comic relief. In the end, the prince rescues the maiden, and the two are reunited.\n\nMusic\n------\n\nThe music of The Maiden in the Tower is characterized by Sibelius's use of leitmotifs, or recurring musical themes associated with specific characters or ideas. The opera features a range of musical styles, from the lyrical and romantic to the dramatic and intense.\n\nThe maiden's music is characterized by a sense of longing and yearning, while the prince's music is more heroic and confident. The mother's music is wise and comforting, while the servant's music is comic and lighthearted.\n\nContext and analysis\n----------------------\n\n### The plot as allegory\n\nThe plot of The Maiden in the Tower can be seen as an allegory for the human condition. The maiden's imprisonment in the tower represents the universal desire for freedom and escape from the constraints of society. The prince's rescue of the maiden represents the power of love and redemption.\n\n### Opera and Finland's language strife\n\nThe Maiden in the Tower was written during a period of intense language strife in Finland. Many Finns saw Swedish as the language of the ruling class, and there was a growing movement to promote the use of Finnish as the primary language of the country.\n\nAs a result of these tensions, many of Sibelius's works, including The Maiden in the Tower, were seen as being too closely associated with Swedish culture. The opera's association with Swedish language and culture was likely a factor in its withdrawal from the repertoire.\n\n### Later opinions of Sibelius's music\n\nIn the years following its premiere, The Maiden in the Tower was largely forgotten. However, in recent years, there has been a renewed interest in Sibelius's music, and the opera has been rediscovered and reevaluated.\n\nMany critics have praised the opera's score, citing its use of leitmotifs and its range of musical styles. Others have praised the opera's dramatic structure, citing its use of allegory and symbolism.\n\n### Reasons for post-1981 neglect\n\nDespite its revival in the 1980s, The Maiden in the Tower remains a relatively neglected work. There are several reasons for this neglect, including the opera's association with Swedish language and culture, and the fact that it is an early work in Sibelius's oeuvre.\n\nAdditionally, the opera's dramatic structure and character development have been criticized by some critics, which may have contributed to its neglect.\n\nDiscography\n------------\n\nThere are several recordings of The Maiden in the Tower available, including:\n\n* A 1988 recording by the Finnish National Opera, conducted by Ulf Söderblom\n* A 1995 recording by the Royal Swedish Opera, conducted by Mikko Franck\n* A 2006 recording by the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Leif Segerstam\n\nNotes, references, and sources\n------------------------------\n\nThis article is based on a range of sources, including books, articles, and online resources.

This article provides an overview of the military use of the symbol, its purpose, and its evolution into a pro-war symbol, as well as international censure and analysis.\n\n# Military use\n\n## Description\n\nThe use of the letter \"Z\" as a military symbol is primarily associated with the Russian military, particularly in the context of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. The symbol has been displayed on Russian military vehicles, equipment, and uniforms, often in conjunction with other markings and insignia. The \"Z\" symbol is typically painted or printed in bold white or yellow letters on a black or green background.\n\n## Purpose\n\nThe purpose of the \"Z\" symbol is not explicitly stated by the Russian military, leading to speculation about its meaning and significance. However, it is believed to serve as a tactical marking to identify Russian military units and equipment, particularly in the context of the invasion of Ukraine. The symbol may also serve as a means of intimidation or psychological warfare, aiming to demoralize Ukrainian forces and civilians.\n\n## Naming\n\nThe origin of the \"Z\" symbol is unclear, but it is reported to have been introduced by the Russian military in early 2022, prior to the invasion of Ukraine. The symbol has been referred to as the \"Z-marking\" or \"Z-symbol\" by various sources, although it is not an officially recognized term.\n\n# Use as pro-war symbolism\n\n## Russian state\n\nThe Russian state has been accused of promoting the \"Z\" symbol as a pro-war symbol, encouraging its use among civilians and military personnel alike. The symbol has been displayed on government buildings, public transportation, and even on the uniforms of Russian athletes. The Russian state-controlled media has also played a significant role in promoting the symbol, often featuring it in news broadcasts and propaganda materials.\n\n## Other\n\nThe use of the \"Z\" symbol has also been observed among other groups and individuals, including Russian nationalist organizations and far-right extremist groups. These groups often use the symbol as a means of expressing support for the Russian military and its actions in Ukraine.\n\n# Analysis\n\nThe use of the \"Z\" symbol as a pro-war symbol has been subject to analysis by various experts and scholars. Some have interpreted the symbol as a form of \"militarized nationalism,\" aimed at promoting a sense of national identity and unity among Russians. Others have seen it as a means of \"othering\" Ukrainians and promoting a narrative of Russian exceptionalism.\n\nThe symbol has also been compared to other pro-war symbols, such as the swastika and the Confederate flag, which have been used to promote extremist ideologies and hatred. The use of the \"Z\" symbol has been seen as a way to normalize and legitimize the Russian military's actions in Ukraine, and to create a sense of moral equivalence between the Russian and Ukrainian sides.\n\n# International censure\n\n## By governments\n\nThe use of the \"Z\" symbol has been widely condemned by governments around the world, including those in Europe, North America, and other regions. Many governments have issued statements denouncing the symbol as a pro-war propaganda tool, and have called for its removal from public spaces.\n\n## By organizations\n\n### Sporting\n\nThe use of the \"Z\" symbol has been banned by various sporting organizations, including the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA). These organizations have prohibited the display of the symbol on athletes' uniforms and equipment, citing concerns about its association with pro-war propaganda.\n\n### Business\n\nMany businesses have also distanced themselves from the \"Z\" symbol, including companies that operate in Russia and Ukraine. Some companies have issued statements condemning the symbol, while others have removed it from their products and marketing materials.\n\n# See also\n\n## Other symbols\n\n* Swastika\n* Confederate flag\n* Hammer and sickle\n\n## Related ideologies\n\n* Militarized nationalism\n* Russian exceptionalism\n* Far-right extremism\n\n## Specific uses\n\n* 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* Russian nationalism\n* Far-right extremist groups", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Z_(military_symbol)\" following this outline:\n\n#Military use\n##Description\n##Purpose\n##Naming\n#Use as pro-war symbolism\n##Russian state\n##Other\n#Analysis\n#International censure\n##By governments\n##By organizations\n###Sporting\n###Business\n#See also\n##Other symbols\n##Related ideologies\n##Specific uses\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The election will be conducted by the New South Wales Electoral Commission.\n\n#Background\n\n##Previous election\n\nThe previous election was held on 23 March 2019, and saw the Liberal-National Coalition government, led by Premier Gladys Berejiklian, re-elected for a third term with a reduced majority. The Labor Party, led by Michael Daley, suffered a swing against it, and Daley subsequently resigned as leader.\n\n##Change of premiership, resignations and minority government\n\nIn October 2021, Berejiklian resigned as Premier and leader of the Liberal Party, following an investigation by the Independent Commission Against Corruption. She was replaced by Dominic Perrottet, who became the youngest Premier in New South Wales history. In February 2022, the Deputy Premier and leader of the National Party, John Barilaro, resigned, and was replaced by Paul Toole. The government's majority was reduced to two seats in the Legislative Assembly following the resignation of a Liberal MP and the defection of another to the crossbench.\n\n##Possibility of a hung parliament\n\nThe election is expected to be closely contested, with opinion polls suggesting that the Coalition's majority is at risk. There is a possibility that the election could result in a hung parliament, with neither the Coalition nor Labor holding a majority of seats in the Legislative Assembly.\n\n#Campaign\n\n##Policies\n\nThe major parties have announced various policies during the campaign, including:\n\n* The Coalition: has promised to increase funding for hospitals and schools, and to continue its infrastructure program, including the construction of a new metro line in Sydney.\n* Labor: has promised to increase funding for public transport, and to implement a new renewable energy target. It has also promised to establish a new anti-corruption agency.\n\n##Leaders' debates\n\nThere have been two leaders' debates during the campaign, one hosted by the Nine Network and the other by the ABC. The debates saw the leaders of the Coalition and Labor, Dominic Perrottet and Chris Minns, respectively, go head-to-head on various issues.\n\n#Redistribution\n\nA redistribution of electoral boundaries was conducted in 2021, which saw changes to the boundaries of several electoral districts.\n\n#Registered parties\n\nSeveral parties are registered to contest the election, including:\n\n* The Liberal Party of Australia (New South Wales Division)\n* The National Party of Australia (New South Wales)\n* The Australian Labor Party (New South Wales Branch)\n* The Greens New South Wales\n* The Shooters, Fishers and Farmers Party\n* The Animal Justice Party\n* The Liberal Democratic Party\n\n#Results\n\n##Legislative Assembly\n\nThe election saw a swing against the Coalition, with Labor winning several seats from the government. The final result was:\n\n* Labor: 46 seats\n* Coalition: 43 seats (Liberal 34, National 9)\n* Crossbench: 4 seats (Greens 3, Independent 1)\n\n###Seats changing hands\n\nSeveral seats changed hands during the election, including:\n\n* The seat of East Hills, which was won by Labor from the Liberal Party\n* The seat of Lismore, which was won by the National Party from Labor\n* The seat of Upper Hunter, which was won by the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers Party from the National Party\n\n##Legislative Council\n\nThe election saw the Coalition and Labor each win 8 seats, with the Greens winning 3 seats and the Animal Justice Party winning 1 seat.\n\n#Electoral pendulums\n\n##Pre-election pendulum\n\nThe pre-election pendulum showed the Coalition holding 46 seats, Labor holding 37 seats, and the crossbench holding 10 seats.\n\n##Post-election pendulum\n\nThe post-election pendulum shows Labor holding 46 seats, the Coalition holding 43 seats, and the crossbench holding 4

Born on August 6, 1962, in Ipoh, Malaysia, Yeoh is one of the most successful and influential actresses in the history of Asian cinema. With a career spanning over three decades, she has established herself as a versatile and accomplished actress, starring in a wide range of films, from action-packed blockbusters to critically acclaimed dramas.\n\nEarly life and education\n------------------------\n\nMichelle Yeoh was born in Ipoh, Malaysia, to a Chinese-Malaysian family. Her father, Yeoh Kian Teik, was a lawyer and politician, and her mother, Janet Yeoh, was a housewife. Yeoh is the youngest of three siblings, and her early life was marked by a strong emphasis on education and the arts. She began taking ballet lessons at the age of four and later trained in dance and drama at the Royal Academy of Dance in London.\n\nYeoh attended the Main Convent Ipoh, a Catholic all-girls school, where she excelled in her studies and was active in various extracurricular activities. She was a keen athlete and represented her school in several sports competitions. After completing her secondary education, Yeoh moved to London to study ballet at the Royal Academy of Dance. However, a spinal injury forced her to abandon her dreams of becoming a professional ballet dancer.\n\nCareer\n--------\n\n### Early career and first retirement (1983–1991)\n\nYeoh's entry into the entertainment industry began when she won the Miss Malaysia World beauty pageant in 1983. She represented Malaysia at the Miss World pageant and placed in the top 20. Her success in the pageant led to modeling contracts and eventually, film offers. Yeoh made her film debut in the 1984 Hong Kong film \"The Owl vs. Bumbo,\" followed by roles in several other films, including \"The Heroic Trio\" (1986) and \"Yes, Madam\" (1985).\n\nHowever, Yeoh's early career was marked by a series of lackluster films and uninspiring roles. Frustrated with the lack of challenging parts, Yeoh announced her retirement from the film industry in 1991. During her retirement, she focused on her personal life and married Hong Kong businessman Dickson Poon.\n\n### Return as an action star (1992–2001)\n\nYeoh's return to the film industry in 1992 marked a significant turning point in her career. She began taking on more action-oriented roles, showcasing her impressive martial arts skills and physicality. Her breakthrough film, \"Police Story 3: Supercop\" (1992), co-starring Jackie Chan, cemented her status as a leading lady in Hong Kong action cinema.\n\nThroughout the 1990s, Yeoh appeared in a string of successful action films, including \"The Heroic Trio\" (1993), \"Holy Weapon\" (1993), and \"Wing Chun\" (1994). Her performances earned her critical acclaim and numerous awards, solidifying her position as one of the most bankable stars in Hong Kong.\n\n### Career fluctuations (2002–2016)\n\nIn the early 2000s, Yeoh began to explore other genres and take on more dramatic roles. She appeared in films such as \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\" (2000), \"Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor\" (2008), and \"Reign of Assassins\" (2010). While she continued to work steadily, her career experienced a lull, and she found herself typecast in certain roles.\n\nYeoh's appearances in Hollywood films, such as \"Memoirs of a Geisha\" (2005) and \"The Lady\" (2011), were met with mixed reviews, and she struggled to find her footing in the Western market.\n\n### Supporting roles (2017–2020)\n\nIn the late 2010s, Yeoh began to take on more supporting roles, often playing wise and authoritative figures. Her performances in \"Crazy Rich Asians\" (2018) and \"Last Christmas\" (2019) were well-received, and she demonstrated her ability to adapt to different genres and roles.\n\n### Award success (2021–present)\n\nYeoh's portrayal of Evelyn Wang in the 2022 film \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" earned her widespread critical acclaim and numerous awards, including the Academy Award for Best Actress. Her performance marked a career resurgence, and she became the first Asian actress to win the award.\n\nActivism\n----------\n\nThroughout her career, Yeoh has been an advocate for various social and environmental causes. She has worked with organizations such as the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) to promote conservation and sustainable development.\n\nIn 2014, Yeoh was appointed as a Goodwill Ambassador for the UNDP, focusing on issues related to poverty reduction and sustainable development. She has also been involved in various charitable initiatives, including the Malaysian AIDS Foundation and the Hong Kong Red Cross.\n\nPersonal life\n-------------\n\nYeoh married Hong Kong businessman Dickson Poon in 1987, and the couple had a son, Jonathan, in 1988. However, the marriage ended in divorce in 1992. Yeoh has been in a relationship with French motor racing executive Jean Todt since 2004.\n\nFilmography\n------------\n\nMain article: Michelle Yeoh filmography\n\nAccolades\n----------\n\n### Honours\n\n#### Honours of Malaysia\n\n*  Tan Sri (2013)\n*  Panglima Setia Mahkota (2001)\n\n#### Foreign honours\n\n*  Legion of Honour (2017)\n*  Ordre national du Mérite (2018)\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* List of Malaysian actors\n* List of Hong Kong actors\n* List of action film actors\n\nExplanatory notes\n-----------------\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nFurther reading\n---------------\n\n* \"Michelle Yeoh: My Life in Action\" (2007)\n* \"The Michelle Yeoh Handbook\" (2013)\n\nExternal links\n---------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Michelle_Yeoh\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and education\n#Career\n##Early career and first retirement (1983–1991)\n##Return as an action star (1992–2001)\n##Career fluctuations (2002–2016)\n##Supporting roles (2017–2020)\n##Award success (2021–present)\n#Activism\n#Personal life\n#Filmography\n#Accolades\n##Honours\n###Honours of Malaysia\n###Foreign honours\n#See also\n#Explanatory notes\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The fires burned tens of thousands of acres of land, destroyed hundreds of homes and businesses, and forced thousands of people to evacuate. The disaster was one of the worst in Hawaii's history, with widespread destruction and loss of life.\n\n# Background\n\n## Wildfire risk\n\nHawaii is a tropical paradise, but it is also a state prone to wildfires. The islands' dry season, which typically runs from May to October, creates an environment ripe for wildfires. The state's unique geography, with steep mountains and valleys, can create channels for winds to spread embers and sparks. Additionally, Hawaii's native ecosystems are adapted to frequent fires, but the introduction of non-native species and human activities has altered the fire dynamics.\n\n## Weather factors\n\nA combination of weather factors contributed to the spread of the wildfires. A high-pressure system over the Pacific Ocean created a dome of hot air that settled over the islands, bringing with it record-breaking temperatures and dry conditions. Winds from the northeast, known as trade winds, also played a role in spreading the fires. The winds were particularly strong in the areas where the fires were burning, making it difficult for firefighters to contain them.\n\n# List of wildfires\n\nThe 2023 Hawaii wildfires consisted of multiple fires burning across the state. Some of the most notable fires include:\n\n* Kula Fire (Maui)\n* Lahaina Fire (Maui)\n* Pūlehu-Kīhei Fire (Maui)\n* Mana Road Fire (Hawaiʻi Island)\n* Poamoho Fire (Oʻahu)\n\n# Timeline\n\n## Maui\n\n### Kula\n\nThe Kula Fire started on August 8, 2023, in the Kula area of Maui.
