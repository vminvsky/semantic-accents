The shooting took place in the afternoon at the Heimfeld district, a quiet residential area in the eastern part of Hamburg. The incident sent shockwaves throughout the country and sparked widespread outrage and condemnation.\n\n#Shooting\n\nThe shooting occurred at approximately 2:45 pm local time at a Jehovah's Witnesses center on Deelböge Street in the Heimfeld district. The gunman, identified as a 35-year-old German national, entered the building and began firing indiscriminately at people inside. Witnesses reported hearing multiple shots and seeing people fleeing the scene in panic.\n\nThe police were quickly alerted, and a large-scale operation was launched to apprehend the suspect. Officers from the Hamburg State Police, along with SWAT teams and emergency services, rushed to the scene to contain the situation. The area was cordoned off, and nearby residents were evacuated as a precautionary measure.\n\nAccording to eyewitness accounts, the shooter was seen wearing a black jacket and carrying a backpack. He reportedly acted alone and did not appear to have any accomplices. The motive behind the attack is still under investigation.\n\n##Investigation\n\nThe Hamburg police launched a comprehensive investigation into the shooting, gathering evidence and conducting interviews with witnesses and potential suspects. Forensic experts were deployed to the scene to analyze the crime scene and identify any potential clues.\n\nAs part of the investigation, police searched the gunman's residence and seized several items, including his laptop and mobile phone. The authorities also reviewed CCTV footage and social media activity to piece together the events leading up to the attack.\n\n#Casualties\n\nThe shooting resulted in seven fatalities and eight injuries, with several others left traumatized by the ordeal. The victims were mostly members of the Jehovah's Witnesses community, who had gathered at the center for a weekly meeting. The ages of the victims ranged from 33 to 60.\n\nAmong the injured were two police officers who were shot while attempting to apprehend the suspect. They were treated for non-life-threatening injuries and released from the hospital.\n\n##Tributes\n\nThe shooting sent shockwaves throughout the community, with many expressing their condolences to the families of the victims. The Jehovah's Witnesses organization issued a statement condemning the attack and calling for peace and understanding.\n\nLocal residents and community leaders also paid tribute to the victims, laying flowers and candles at the scene of the crime. A vigil was held in the evening, with hundreds gathering to mourn the loss of life and offer support to the affected families.\n\n#Perpetrator\n\nThe gunman, identified as Philipp F., was a 35-year-old German national with no known extremist affiliations. He was born and raised in Hamburg and had no prior convictions.\n\nAccording to police, Philipp F. was a former member of the Jehovah's Witnesses community but had been expelled several years ago due to his increasingly erratic behavior. He had reportedly become isolated and withdrawn, with few friends or acquaintances.\n\n##Mental Health\n\nThe investigation revealed that Philipp F. had a history of mental health issues, including depression and anxiety. He had been receiving treatment but had stopped attending therapy sessions several months prior to the attack.\n\nThe authorities also discovered that Philipp F. had been active on online forums, expressing his grievances against the Jehovah's Witnesses organization and its members. The content of these posts has not been publicly disclosed.\n\n#Reactions\n\nThe shooting sparked widespread outrage and condemnation across Germany, with politicians and community leaders calling for increased security measures and greater support for mental health services.\n\n##Government Response\n\nThe German government issued a statement condemning the attack and pledging to do everything in its power to prevent similar incidents in the future. The Interior Minister announced plans to increase security measures at places of worship and community centers.\n\n##International Response\n\nThe international community also expressed its condolences to the families of the victims, with leaders from around the world condemning the attack and calling for greater unity and cooperation in the face of terrorism and extremism.\n\n#See also\n\n* List of mass shootings in Germany\n* Jehovah's Witnesses and violence\n* Mental health in Germany\n\n#References\n\n*Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements*\n\n#External links\n\n*Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements*", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Hamburg_shooting\" following this outline:\n\n#Shooting\n#Casualties\n#Perpetrator\n#Reactions\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The team has a rich history, having competed in several major tournaments, including the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA European Championship.\n\n# History\n\n## Official formation\n\nThe Croatia national football team was officially formed in 1991, following the country's independence from Yugoslavia. However, the team's origins date back to 1940, when a Croatian national team was formed during World War II. This team played several friendly matches against other national teams, but it was not recognized by FIFA.\n\n## Blažević period (1994–1999)\n\nThe modern Croatia national team was formed in 1994, with Miroslav Blažević as its first manager. Blažević led the team to its first major tournament, the 1996 European Championship, where they were eliminated in the quarterfinals by Germany. The team also qualified for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, where they finished third, defeating the Netherlands 2-1 in the third-place playoff.\n\n## Jozić, Barić and Kranjčar period (2000–2006)\n\nAfter Blažević's departure, the team was managed by several coaches, including Mirko Jozić, Zlatko Kranjčar, and Otto Barić. During this period, the team qualified for the 2002 FIFA World Cup and the 2004 European Championship, but failed to advance beyond the group stage.\n\n## Bilić period (2006–2012)\n\nSlaven Bilić took over as manager in 2006 and led the team to the 2008 European Championship, where they were eliminated in the quarterfinals by Turkey. The team also qualified for the 2010 FIFA World Cup and the 2012 European Championship, but failed to advance beyond the group stage.\n\n## Štimac, Kovač and Čačić period (2012–2017)\n\nAfter Bilić's departure, the team was managed by Igor Štimac, Niko Kovač, and Ante Čačić. During this period, the team qualified for the 2014 FIFA World Cup and the 2016 European Championship, but failed to advance beyond the group stage.\n\n## Dalić period (since 2017)\n\nZlatko Dalić took over as manager in 2017 and led the team to the 2018 FIFA World Cup, where they finished runners-up, losing to France in the final. The team also qualified for the 2020 European Championship, where they were eliminated in the round of 16 by Spain.\n\n# Image\n\n## Kits\n\nThe Croatia national team's kit is manufactured by Nike and features the country's national colors, red, white, and blue. The home kit is typically red and white checkered, while the away kit is blue.\n\n## Supporters\n\nThe Croatia national team has a large and dedicated fan base, known as the \"Vatreni\" (The Fiery Ones). The fans are known for their passionate support and have been recognized for their sportsmanship and fair play.\n\n## Charity\n\nThe Croatia national team has been involved in several charitable initiatives, including supporting children's hospitals and participating in fundraising campaigns for disaster relief.\n\n# Stadiums\n\nThe Croatia national team plays its home matches at the Stadion Maksimir in Zagreb, which has a seating capacity of over 40,000. The team has also played at other stadiums in the country, including the Stadion Poljud in Split and the Stadion Kantrida in Rijeka.\n\n# Results and fixtures\n\n## 2023\n\n* March 25, 2023: Croatia

His early life was marked by poverty and struggle. Ahmed's father was a daily-wage laborer, and the family had to work hard to make ends meet. Despite the financial struggles, Ahmed's parents managed to send him to school, where he showed a keen interest in politics from an early age.\n\nAhmed's entry into politics was largely influenced by his brother, Khalid Azim alias Ashraf, who was already involved in local politics. Ashraf's connections with local politicians and his involvement in various social activities inspired Ahmed to follow in his footsteps.\n\n# Political career\n\n## Entry into politics\n\nAtiq Ahmed's entry into politics was marked by his involvement in the Samajwadi Party, a prominent political party in Uttar Pradesh. He began his career as a local leader, working his way up the ranks by building relationships with local politicians and community leaders. Ahmed's charisma and oratory skills quickly made him a popular figure in local politics.\n\n## As a member of Lok Sabha\n\nAhmed's big break came in 2004 when he was elected as a Member of Parliament from the Phulpur constituency in Uttar Pradesh. He was just 42 years old at the time and was seen as a rising star in the Samajwadi Party. During his tenure as an MP, Ahmed was known for his vocal support of the party's ideology and his involvement in various social causes.\n\n## Participation from prison\n\nDespite being involved in several high-profile crimes, Ahmed continued to participate in politics even from behind bars. In 2008, while he was lodged in a prison in Allahabad, Ahmed contested and won the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly election from the Allahabad West constituency. His victory was seen as a testament to his enduring popularity in the region.\n\n# Electoral history\n\n* 2004: Elected as Member of Parliament from Phulpur constituency\n* 2008: Elected as Member of Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly from Allahabad West constituency\n* 2012: Lost the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly election from Allahabad West constituency\n\n# Criminal cases\n\nAtiq Ahmed's involvement in crime dates back to the 1990s. He was initially involved in petty crimes, but soon graduated to more serious offenses.\n\n## Introduction to crime\n\nAhmed's introduction to crime was largely influenced by his association with local gangsters and politicians. His involvement in crime began with extortion and intimidation, but soon he became involved in more serious crimes, including murder and kidnapping.\n\n## Raju Pal murder\n\nIn 2005, Ahmed was accused of murdering Raju Pal, a local politician and businessman. Pal was a prominent figure in the Samajwadi Party and had been at odds with Ahmed over various issues. Ahmed was arrested and charged with Pal's murder, but he was later acquitted due to lack of evidence.\n\n## SHUATS assault case\n\nIn 2018, Ahmed was accused of assaulting a professor at the Sam Higginbottom University of Agriculture, Technology and Sciences (SHUATS) in Allahabad. The professor had allegedly refused to give Ahmed's son admission to the university. Ahmed was arrested and charged with assault, but he was later released on bail.\n\n## Umesh Pal abduction and murder\n\nIn 2023, Ahmed was accused of abducting and murdering Umesh Pal, a local businessman. Pal had been a witness in the Raju Pal murder case and had testified against Ahmed. Ahmed was arrested and charged with Pal's murder, but he died in police custody before he could be brought to trial.\n\n# Death\n\nAtiq Ahmed died on April 15, 2023, while in police custody. He was 60 years old at the time of his death. Ahmed's death was seen as a major blow to the Samajwadi Party, which had been struggling to revive its fortunes in Uttar Pradesh.\n\n# See also\n\n* Samajwadi Party\n* Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly\n* Lok Sabha\n* Raju Pal\n* Umesh Pal", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Atiq_Ahmed\" following this outline:\n\n#Early and personal life\n#Political career\n##Entry into politics\n##As a member of Lok Sabha\n##Participation from prison\n#Electoral history\n#Criminal cases\n##Introduction to crime\n##Raju Pal murder\n##SHUATS assault case\n##Umesh Pal abduction and murder\n#Death\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He was known for his remarkable intelligence, agility, and mischievous behavior, which often led to trouble and controversy. This article provides an overview of Joe Martin's life, career, and notable incidents.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nOrangutans, native to Indonesia and Malaysia, are one of the most intelligent primates, known for their advanced problem-solving skills and adaptability. In the early 20th century, it was not uncommon for orangutans to be captured and brought to the United States for exhibition and entertainment purposes. Joe Martin was one such orangutan, who would go on to become a celebrated performer and a household name.\n\nBiography\n----------\n\n### Transoceanic shipment and first owners\n\nJoe Martin was born in the wild, likely in the jungles of Borneo or Sumatra. He was captured at a young age and shipped to the United States, where he was purchased by a wealthy businessman named Henry Trefflich. Trefflich, a collector of exotic animals, kept Joe Martin at his estate in New York, where he was cared for by a team of trainers and handlers.\n\n### 1915–1917: Breakout film and early work\n\nIn 1915, Joe Martin made his film debut in a short comedy called \"The Orang-Outang,\" which was produced by the Edison Manufacturing Company. The film was a surprise hit, and Joe Martin's antics on screen quickly made him a fan favorite. Over the next few years, he appeared in several more films, including \"The Mischievous Orang-Outang\" and \"Joe Martin's Day Out.\"\n\n### 1918: Influenza epidemic, and night-watchman incident\n\nIn 1918, the United States was hit by a devastating influenza epidemic, which claimed millions of lives. Joe Martin's owner, Henry Trefflich, was among those who fell ill, and the orangutan was left in the care of a night watchman named John Smith. One night, while Smith was on duty, Joe Martin managed to escape from his enclosure and roam freely around the estate. The incident caused a stir in the local community, and Joe Martin's reputation as a mischievous and cunning animal was solidified.\n\n### 1919: Escapes and Al Santell incident\n\nIn 1919, Joe Martin was involved in two notable incidents. The first occurred when he escaped from his enclosure and climbed a tree on the estate, where he remained for several hours. The second incident involved a film director named Al Santell, who was working with Joe Martin on a new film project. According to reports, Joe Martin became agitated during filming and attacked Santell, causing him to sustain serious injuries.\n\n### 1920: Tarzan incident\n\nIn 1920, Joe Martin was involved in a notorious incident with the famous actor Elmo Lincoln, who was starring in a film adaptation of Edgar Rice Burroughs' \"Tarzan of the Apes.\" During filming, Joe Martin became agitated and attacked Lincoln, who was forced to flee the set. The incident was widely reported in the press, and Joe Martin's reputation as a volatile and unpredictable animal was further cemented.\n\n### 1921: Continuing in show business, Ethel Stecker incident\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding him, Joe Martin continued to work in show business, appearing in films and live shows throughout the United States. In 1921, he was involved in an incident with a woman named Ethel Stecker, who was working as a trainer and handler for Joe Martin's owner. According to reports, Joe Martin became aggressive towards Stecker and attacked her, causing her to sustain serious injuries.\n\n### 1922–1923: Behavioral issues, death of Curley Stecker\n\nIn 1922 and 1923, Joe Martin's behavioral issues continued to cause problems for his owners and handlers. He was involved in several incidents, including a notable attack on a man named Curley Stecker, who was the brother of Ethel Stecker. Tragically, Curley Stecker died as a result of his injuries, and Joe Martin was widely condemned for his actions.\n\n### 1923–1927: Barnes Circus and Barnes City Zoo\n\nIn 1923, Joe Martin was sold to the Barnes Circus, a traveling circus that was based in the United States. He spent several years with the circus, performing in live shows and exhibitions. In 1927, the Barnes Circus was sold to a new owner, who established the Barnes City Zoo in New York. Joe Martin was one of the main attractions at the zoo, where he was kept in a large enclosure and displayed to the public.\n\n### 1928–1931: Last reports\n\nThe last reports of Joe Martin's life date back to the late 1920s and early 1930s. According to accounts, he continued to live at the Barnes City Zoo, where he was cared for by a team of trainers and handlers. However, his health began to decline, and he eventually passed away in 1931, at the age of around 20.\n\nFilmography\n-----------\n\nJoe Martin appeared in numerous films during his career, including:\n\n* \"The Orang-Outang\" (1915)\n* \"The Mischievous Orang-Outang\" (1916)\n* \"Joe Martin's Day Out\" (1917)\n* \"Tarzan of the Apes\" (1920)\n* \"The Jungle King\" (1922)\n\nGallery\n--------\n\n* [Image: Joe Martin in his enclosure at the Barnes City Zoo]\n* [Image: Joe Martin performing in a live show]\n* [Image: Joe Martin with his trainer and handler]\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Orangutan\n* Primates in entertainment\n* Animal training\n* Zoos and aquariums\n\nNotes\n-----\n\n* This article is based on historical records and reports from the time period.\n* The exact dates and details of Joe Martin's life and career are not always certain, and may be subject to interpretation.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n* (No references cited)\n\nFurther reading\n---------------\n\n* \"The Orang-Outang: A Study of the Behavior of a Captive Orangutan\" by Charles H.

The counteroffensive marked a significant turning point in the conflict, as Ukraine sought to regain momentum and push back against Russian advances.\n\n# Background\n\n## State of the war\n\nBy the summer of 2023, the war in Ukraine had reached a stalemate, with both sides dug in along a 600-mile front line. Russian forces had made significant gains in the east and south, but Ukrainian resistance had prevented them from achieving a decisive victory. The Ukrainian military had been working to rebuild and rearm, with significant support from Western countries, and was now poised to launch a counterattack.\n\n## Russian defenses\n\nRussian forces had established a network of defensive lines and fortifications, including minefields, trenches, and artillery emplacements. These defenses were designed to slow down a Ukrainian advance and allow Russian troops to regroup and counterattack. However, Ukrainian military planners believed that they had identified weaknesses in the Russian defenses that could be exploited.\n\n# Prelude\n\n## Planning\n\nUkrainian military planners had been working on a counteroffensive strategy for several months, using intelligence gathered from reconnaissance missions, satellite imagery, and other sources. The plan involved a coordinated attack on multiple fronts, with the aim of breaking through Russian defenses and retaking key territory.\n\n## Shaping operations\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the counteroffensive, Ukrainian forces conducted a series of shaping operations, designed to weaken Russian defenses and create opportunities for a breakthrough. These operations included artillery strikes, drone attacks, and special forces raids, all aimed at disrupting Russian supply lines and command structures.\n\n# Counteroffensive\n\n## Start date\n\nThe Ukrainian counteroffensive began on June 4, 2023, with a series of coordinated attacks on Russian positions along the front line. The attacks were launched simultaneously on multiple fronts, catching Russian forces off guard and forcing them to respond quickly to the new threat.\n\n## Southern front\n\n### Melitopol direction\n\nIn the south, Ukrainian forces launched a major attack on the city of Melitopol, which had been occupied by Russian troops since the start of the war. The attack was led by the Ukrainian 35th Marine Brigade, which fought its way through Russian defenses and entered the city on June 6.\n\n### Berdiansk direction: Staromaiorske-Urozhaine\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian forces also launched an attack on the Berdiansk direction, with the aim of retaking the town of Staromaiorske and the surrounding area. The attack was successful, and Ukrainian troops were able to establish a foothold in the area.\n\n## Eastern front\n\n### Donetsk Oblast\n\nOn the eastern front, Ukrainian forces launched a series of attacks on Russian positions in the Donetsk Oblast, with the aim of retaking key territory and pushing back Russian advances. The attacks were successful, and Ukrainian troops were able to make significant gains in the area.\n\n## Dnieper front\n\nIn the Dnieper region, Ukrainian forces launched a series of attacks on Russian positions along the river, with the aim of retaking key territory and disrupting Russian supply lines. The attacks were successful, and Ukrainian troops were able to establish a foothold in the area.\n\n## Behind front lines\n\n### Crimea and the Black Sea\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian forces also launched a series of attacks on Russian positions in Crimea and the Black Sea, with the aim of disrupting Russian supply lines and command structures. The attacks were successful, and Ukrainian troops were able to establish a foothold in the area.\n\n### Other areas\n\nUkrainian forces also launched attacks on Russian positions in other areas, including the Kharkiv and Sumy regions. The attacks were successful, and Ukrainian troops were able to make significant gains in the area.\n\n## Result\n\nThe Ukrainian counteroffensive was successful, with Ukrainian troops able to retake significant territory and push back Russian advances. The counteroffensive marked a significant turning point in the conflict, as Ukraine regained momentum and began to push back against Russian forces.\n\n# Strengths\n\n## Personnel\n\nThe Ukrainian military had a significant advantage in terms of personnel, with a large and well-trained army that was able to launch a coordinated attack on multiple fronts. Ukrainian troops were highly motivated and well-led, with a strong sense of purpose and a determination to retake their country.\n\n## Equipment\n\nThe Ukrainian military also had a significant advantage in terms of equipment, with a large arsenal of artillery, tanks, and other military hardware. Ukrainian troops were well-equipped and well-supplied, with a strong logistics system that allowed them to maintain a high tempo of operations.\n\n# Casualties and losses\n\n## Ukraine\n\nUkrainian forces suffered significant casualties during the counteroffensive, with estimates suggesting that hundreds of troops were killed or wounded. However, the Ukrainian military was able to absorb these losses and continue to push forward.\n\n## Russia\n\nRussian forces also suffered significant casualties during the counteroffensive, with estimates suggesting that thousands of troops were killed or wounded. The Russian military was forced to withdraw from several key areas, and its ability to launch a counterattack was severely limited.\n\n# Analysis\n\n## Timeframe and progression\n\nThe Ukrainian counteroffensive was a complex and multifaceted operation that involved a coordinated attack on multiple fronts. The operation was carefully planned and executed, with Ukrainian troops making significant gains in the first few weeks of the counteroffensive.\n\n## Significance and goals\n\nThe Ukrainian counteroffensive was a significant turning point in the conflict, as Ukraine regained momentum and began to push back against Russian forces. The counteroffensive marked a major shift in the balance of power, with Ukrainian troops able to retake significant territory and disrupt Russian supply lines.\n\n### Concerns\n\nHowever, there were also concerns about the sustainability of the Ukrainian counteroffensive, with some analysts warning that Ukrainian troops were overextended and vulnerable to a Russian counterattack. There were also concerns about the humanitarian impact of the conflict, with thousands of civilians caught in the crossfire.\n\n## Tactics and equipment\n\n### Russian minefields and fortifications\n\nRussian forces had established a network of minefields and fortifications, including trenches, bunkers, and artillery emplacements. These defenses were designed to slow down a Ukrainian advance and allow Russian troops to regroup and counterattack.\n\n### Artillery and aerial warfare\n\nUkrainian forces made significant use of artillery and aerial warfare during the counteroffensive, with a large arsenal of artillery and airpower that allowed them to pound Russian positions and disrupt their supply lines.\n\n### Other tactics and equipment\n\nUkrainian forces also made use of other tactics and equipment, including drones, special forces, and electronic warfare. These tactics allowed Ukrainian troops to gather intelligence, disrupt Russian communications, and launch surprise attacks on Russian positions.\n\n## Russian command\n\n### Structure\n\nThe Russian military command structure was complex and bureaucratic, with a large and slow-moving chain of command that made it difficult to respond quickly to changing circumstances.\n\n### Issues\n\nThere were also issues with Russian command, including a lack of coordination and communication between different units and a failure to adapt to changing circumstances. These issues allowed Ukrainian troops to exploit weaknesses in the Russian defenses and launch a successful counterattack.\n\n# Early reactions\n\n## Governmental\n\nThe Ukrainian government hailed the counteroffensive as a major success, with President Volodymyr Zelensky praising the bravery and determination of Ukrainian troops. The Russian government, on the other hand, was more subdued, with President Vladimir Putin acknowledging that Ukrainian troops had made gains but insisting that the Russian military was still in control.\n\n## Russian information space and milbloggers\n\nThe Russian information space was filled with contradictory reports and claims, with some milbloggers and analysts praising the Russian military's performance while others criticized its failures. There were also reports of Russian troops being withdrawn from the front line and redeployed to other areas.\n\n# See also\n\n* 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* Ukrainian Armed Forces\n* Russian Armed Forces\n* War in Donbas (2014–2022)\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a general overview of the 2023 Ukrainian counteroffensive.

The 11th named storm of the 2022 Pacific typhoon season, Hinnamnor was a large and intense typhoon that brought strong winds, heavy rainfall, and significant damage to the regions it affected.\n\n# Meteorological history\n\nTyphoon Hinnamnor formed on August 28, 2022, as a tropical depression in the western Pacific Ocean, approximately 1,000 km (620 miles) southeast of the Japanese island of Okinawa. The system gradually intensified, becoming a tropical storm on August 30 and a typhoon on September 1. Hinnamnor rapidly intensified over the next few days, reaching its peak intensity on September 4 as a Category 5-equivalent super typhoon with maximum sustained winds of 250 km/h (155 mph) and a minimum central pressure of 920 hPa (27.17 inHg).\n\nAfter reaching its peak intensity, Hinnamnor began to slowly weaken as it approached the Ryukyu Islands, Japan. The typhoon made landfall on the island of Kyushu on September 6, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall to the region. Hinnamnor then moved northward, passing through the Korea Strait and making landfall on the southern coast of South Korea on September 7.\n\n# Preparations\n\n## Japan\n\nIn anticipation of Typhoon Hinnamnor's landfall, the Japanese government issued a series of warnings and advisories, including a typhoon warning for the Ryukyu Islands and a heavy rainfall warning for the Kyushu region. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) warned of the potential for strong winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surges, and advised residents to take necessary precautions.\n\nThe Japanese government also took steps to prepare for the typhoon, including evacuating residents from low-lying areas and deploying emergency responders to affected regions. The country's transportation systems, including airports and train lines, were also shut down or reduced in preparation for the storm.\n\n## South Korea\n\nIn South Korea, the government issued a series of alerts and warnings, including a typhoon alert for the southern coast and a heavy rainfall warning for the Jeju Island. The Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) warned of the potential for strong winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surges, and advised residents to take necessary precautions.\n\nThe South Korean government also took steps to prepare for the typhoon, including evacuating residents from low-lying areas and deploying emergency responders to affected regions. The country's transportation systems, including airports and train lines, were also shut down or reduced in preparation for the storm.\n\n## Elsewhere\n\nIn addition to Japan and South Korea, other countries in the region, including Taiwan and the Philippines, also issued warnings and advisories in anticipation of Typhoon Hinnamnor's approach.\n\n# Impact\n\n## Japan\n\nTyphoon Hinnamnor brought significant damage and disruption to Japan, particularly in the Kyushu region. The storm's strong winds and heavy rainfall caused widespread power outages, with over 100,000 households left without electricity. The storm also caused significant damage to buildings and infrastructure, including the collapse of a highway bridge in the city of Fukuoka.\n\nThe storm's heavy rainfall also caused significant flooding, particularly in the city of Sasebo, where over 1,000 residents were evacuated due to rising floodwaters. The city's port was also closed due to the storm, with several ships damaged or sunk.\n\n## South Korea\n\nIn South Korea, Typhoon Hinnamnor brought significant damage and disruption, particularly in the southern coast. The storm's strong winds and heavy rainfall caused widespread power outages, with over 50,000 households left without electricity. The storm also caused significant damage to buildings and infrastructure, including the collapse of a highway overpass in the city of Busan.\n\nThe storm's heavy rainfall also caused significant flooding, particularly in the city of Pohang, where over 500 residents were evacuated due to rising floodwaters. The city's port was also closed due to the storm, with several ships damaged or sunk.\n\n## Elsewhere\n\nIn addition to Japan and South Korea, other countries in the region, including Taiwan and the Philippines, also reported damage and disruption from Typhoon Hinnamnor. However, the storm's impact was generally less severe in these countries, with no reports of significant damage or casualties.\n\n# Retirement\n\nDue to the significant damage and disruption caused by Typhoon Hinnamnor, the name \"Hinnamnor\" was retired from the list of tropical cyclone names in the western Pacific Ocean. The name was replaced by \"Hinamnor\", which will be used for future tropical cyclones in the region.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of tropical cyclones in the western Pacific Ocean\n* List of retired tropical cyclone names\n* Typhoon season\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a factual and informative account of Typhoon Hinnamnor, a powerful tropical cyclone that affected several countries in East Asia in September 2022.

These elections were considered a crucial test for the Democratic Party, which had controlled both the White House and Congress since the 2020 elections. The elections saw a significant shift in the balance of power, with the Republican Party making gains in the House of Representatives and the Senate.\n\nBackground\n\nThe 2022 elections took place against the backdrop of a polarized national environment, with rising inflation, ongoing debates over abortion and gun control, and concerns about the integrity of American democracy. The COVID-19 pandemic had receded from its peak, but its impact on the economy and public health continued to be felt. The presidency of Joe Biden, who had taken office in 2021, was also a major factor in the elections, with his policies and performance being closely scrutinized by voters.\n\nCampaign\n\nThe 2022 campaign season saw a high level of intensity and investment, with both parties and their supporters spending vast sums of money on advertising, voter mobilization, and other campaign activities. The campaign also saw a surge in early voting and mail-in ballots, which reflected changes in voting patterns brought about by the pandemic.\n\nPrimaries\n\nThe primary season for the 2022 elections began in February 2022 and lasted until September 2022. During this period, both parties held contests in various states to select their nominees for the general elections. The primary season saw several notable contests, including the Republican primary in Pennsylvania, where Dr. Mehmet Oz won the nomination for the Senate, and the Democratic primary in Texas, where Beto O'Rourke won the nomination for governor.\n\nIssues\n\nThe 2022 campaign was dominated by a range of issues, including the economy, abortion, crime and gun violence, democracy, education, climate change, immigration, student loan forgiveness, and the presidency of Joe Biden.\n\nEconomy\n\nThe economy was a major issue in the 2022 elections, with rising inflation and concerns about economic growth dominating the debate. The Biden administration's handling of the economy was a key point of contention, with Republicans arguing that its policies had led to higher prices and slower growth.\n\nAbortion\n\nAbortion was another highly contentious issue in the 2022 elections, following the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which overturned the constitutional right to abortion established in Roe v. Wade. The decision sparked widespread protests and calls for action from pro-choice groups, while anti-abortion groups celebrated the ruling as a major victory.\n\nCrime and gun violence\n\nCrime and gun violence were also major issues in the 2022 elections, with concerns about public safety and the need for stricter gun control laws dominating the debate. The Biden administration's efforts to address these issues, including its support for universal background checks and red flag laws, were opposed by many Republicans, who argued that such measures would infringe on Second Amendment rights.\n\nDemocracy\n\nThe integrity of American democracy was another key issue in the 2022 elections, with concerns about voter suppression, election security, and the spread of misinformation dominating the debate. The Biden administration's efforts to address these issues, including its support for the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Electoral Count Reform Act, were opposed by many Republicans, who argued that such measures would undermine the integrity of the electoral process.\n\nEducation\n\nEducation was also a major issue in the 2022 elections, with concerns about the quality of public education and the need for increased funding dominating the debate. The Biden administration's efforts to address these issues, including its support for universal pre-K and student loan forgiveness, were opposed by many Republicans, who argued that such measures would be too costly and ineffective.\n\nClimate change\n\nClimate change was another key issue in the 2022 elections, with concerns about the need for urgent action to address this global crisis dominating the debate. The Biden administration's efforts to address this issue, including its support for the Paris Agreement and its efforts to promote clean energy, were opposed by many Republicans, who argued that such measures would be too costly and ineffective.\n\nImmigration\n\nImmigration was also a major issue in the 2022 elections, with concerns about border security and the need for comprehensive immigration reform dominating the debate. The Biden administration's efforts to address these issues, including its support for a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and its efforts to address the root causes of migration, were opposed by many Republicans, who argued that such measures would be too lenient and ineffective.\n\nStudent loan forgiveness\n\nStudent loan forgiveness was another key issue in the 2022 elections, with concerns about the need to address the growing burden of student debt dominating the debate. The Biden administration's efforts to address this issue, including its support for student loan forgiveness and its efforts to make college more affordable, were opposed by many Republicans, who argued that such measures would be too costly and ineffective.\n\nPresidency of Joe Biden\n\nThe presidency of Joe Biden was also a major issue in the 2022 elections, with his policies and performance being closely scrutinized by voters. The Biden administration's handling of the economy, its response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and its efforts to address various domestic and foreign policy issues were all major points of contention in the campaign.\n\nRussian invasion of Ukraine\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine was also a major issue in the 2022 elections, with concerns about the need for American leadership in response to this crisis dominating the debate. The Biden administration's efforts to address this issue, including its support for Ukraine and its efforts to impose sanctions on Russia, were opposed by many Republicans, who argued that such measures would be too weak and ineffective.\n\nCampaign spending\n\nThe 2022 campaign saw a record amount of spending, with both parties and their supporters investing vast sums of money in advertising, voter mobilization, and other campaign activities.

He is considered one of the most important rulers of the Old Kingdom, known for his extensive building projects, military campaigns, and administrative reforms.\n\nFamily\n--------\n\n### Parents and siblings\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I was the son of Pharaoh Pepi I and his half-sister, Queen Ankhesenpepi II. His father, Pepi I, was a prominent ruler of the 6th dynasty, known for his extensive building projects and military campaigns. Merenre's mother, Ankhesenpepi II, was a daughter of Pharaoh Merenre Nemtyemsaf I's predecessor, Pepi I, and his sister-wife, Ankhesenpepi I. Merenre had several siblings, including his half-brother, Pepi II, who would eventually succeed him as pharaoh.\n\n### Consorts and children\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I had several consorts, including Queen Ankhesenpepi III, who was his half-sister and the daughter of Pepi I and Ankhesenpepi II. He also had a consort named Seshseshet, who was the mother of his successor, Pepi II. Merenre had several children, including Pepi II, who would eventually succeed him as pharaoh, and possibly a daughter named Seshseshet, who would marry a noble named Ptahshepses.\n\nReign\n------\n\n### Attestations\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I is attested in several historical records, including the Turin Papyrus, which lists his reign as lasting 44 years. He is also mentioned in the Abydos King List, which lists his name as \"Merenre\". Additionally, several of his monuments and inscriptions have been discovered, including his pyramid complex at Saqqara.\n\n### Chronology\n\n#### Relative\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's reign is dated to the 6th dynasty of ancient Egypt, which is believed to have lasted from circa 2323 to 2181 BC. His predecessor, Pepi I, is believed to have ruled from circa 2332 to 2287 BC, and his successor, Pepi II, is believed to have ruled from circa 2181 to 2180 BC.\n\n#### Absolute\n\nThe absolute dates of Merenre Nemtyemsaf I's reign are not certain, but it is believed to have lasted from circa 2287 to 2181 BC. This dating is based on several factors, including the Turin Papyrus, which lists his reign as lasting 44 years, and the Abydos King List, which lists his name as \"Merenre\".\n\n### Duration\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's reign is believed to have lasted for 44 years, according to the Turin Papyrus. This is a relatively long reign, and it is possible that he may have reigned for even longer.\n\n### Accession to the throne: co-regency\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I may have ruled in co-regency with his father, Pepi I, for a period of time. This is suggested by several inscriptions, including one found at Tanis, which lists both Pepi I and Merenre Nemtyemsaf I as rulers.\n\n### Domestic activities\n\n#### Administration\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I is known to have implemented several administrative reforms during his reign. These reforms included the creation of a new system of provincial administration, which divided Egypt into several provinces, each governed by a local official.\n\n#### Cultic activities\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I was also known for his cultic activities, including the worship of several gods, including Ptah and Re. He built several temples and shrines, including a temple at Memphis, which was dedicated to the worship of Ptah.\n\n#### Construction works\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I was a prolific builder, and his reign saw the construction of several major projects, including his pyramid complex at Saqqara. This complex included a main pyramid, a mortuary temple, and several smaller pyramids.\n\n### End of reign\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's reign came to an end with his death, which is believed to have occurred circa 2181 BC. He was succeeded by his son, Pepi II, who would go on to rule for over 90 years.\n\nForeign activities\n-----------------\n\n### Eastern Desert and Levant\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I is known to have conducted several military campaigns in the Eastern Desert and Levant. These campaigns were likely aimed at securing Egypt's borders and protecting its trade interests.\n\n### Nubia\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I also conducted several military campaigns in Nubia, which was a region located to the south of Egypt. These campaigns were likely aimed at securing Egypt's borders and protecting its trade interests.\n\nPyramid complex\n----------------\n\n### Main pyramid\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's pyramid complex at Saqqara includes a main pyramid, which was built using limestone and granite blocks. The pyramid is estimated to have been around 52 meters tall, and it was originally cased in smooth limestone.\n\n### Mortuary temple\n\nThe pyramid complex also includes a mortuary temple, which was built to the east of the pyramid. The temple was used for the worship of Merenre Nemtyemsaf I after his death, and it included several shrines and offering tables.\n\n### Mummy\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's mummy was discovered in his pyramid complex at Saqqara. The mummy was found to be well-preserved, and it included several funerary masks and other objects.\n\nLegacy\n--------\n\n### Old Kingdom\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's reign is considered one of the most important of the Old Kingdom. He implemented several administrative reforms, and his building projects helped to establish Egypt as a major power.\n\n### Later periods\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's legacy continued to be felt in later periods of ancient Egyptian history. He was remembered as a great pharaoh, and his building projects were often cited as examples of Egyptian greatness.\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n(Note: The article does not include any citations or references as per the requirements)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Merenre_Nemtyemsaf_I\" following this outline:\n\n#Family\n##Parents and siblings\n##Consorts and children\n#Reign\n##Attestations\n##Chronology\n###Relative\n###Absolute\n##Duration\n##Accession to the throne: co-regency\n##Domestic activities\n###Administration\n###Cultic activities\n###Construction works\n##End of reign\n#Foreign activities\n##Eastern Desert and Levant\n##Nubia\n#Pyramid complex\n##Main pyramid\n##Mortuary temple\n##Mummy\n#Legacy\n##Old Kingdom\n##Later periods\n#Notes\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The film is produced by Aditya Chopra under the banner of Yash Raj Films (YRF). Pathaan marks the fourth installment in the YRF Spy Universe and stars Shah Rukh Khan, Deepika Padukone, and John Abraham in the lead roles.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe film follows the story of Pathaan (Shah Rukh Khan), a former Indian army officer who is recruited by the Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW) to take down a rogue agent named Jim (John Abraham). Jim, a former ISI agent, has stolen a deadly virus that has the potential to wipe out the entire population of India. Pathaan must use his skills and resources to track down Jim and retrieve the virus before it falls into the wrong hands. Along the way, he is aided by Rubina (Deepika Padukone), a Pakistani ISI agent who has her own reasons for wanting to take down Jim.\n\nAs Pathaan navigates the complex web of international espionage, he must confront his own demons and make difficult choices to save the country from the brink of disaster.

The soundtrack features five songs, including the hit single \"Besharam Rang,\" which was released in December 2022. The song features Shah Rukh Khan and Deepika Padukone in a romantic dance sequence, set against the backdrop of the Spanish countryside.\n\n# Controversy\n\nPathaan was embroiled in controversy in December 2022, when the song \"Besharam Rang\" sparked outrage among some sections of the Indian population. The song's lyrics and visuals were deemed objectionable by some, who claimed that they were anti-Hindu and anti-Indian. The controversy led to the film's trailer being banned in some states, and the filmmakers were forced to make changes to the song.\n\n# Marketing\n\nThe marketing campaign for Pathaan began in October 2022, with the release of the film's first teaser. The teaser featured Shah Rukh Khan in a dramatic action sequence, set against the backdrop of a desert landscape. The film's trailer was released in December 2022, and it quickly went viral on social media.\n\n# Release\n\n## Theatrical\n\nPathaan was released in theaters on January 25, 2023, in India and worldwide.

The film is based on the fairy tale \"Sleeping Beauty\" by Charles Perrault and the Brothers Grimm, and it tells the story of Princess Aurora, a beautiful young woman who is placed under a sleeping curse by the evil fairy Maleficent.\n\n#Plot\n\nThe film begins with the introduction of King Stefan and Queen Leah, who are overjoyed at the birth of their daughter, Princess Aurora. The entire kingdom is invited to the princess's christening, and three good fairies, Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather, are tasked with bestowing gifts upon the princess. However, the evil fairy Maleficent, who was not invited to the christening, appears and curses the princess to prick her finger on a spinning wheel and fall into a deep sleep on her 16th birthday.\n\nThe good fairies are unable to reverse the curse, but they are able to modify it so that Aurora will not die, but instead fall into a deep sleep that can only be broken by the kiss of true love. The king and queen, desperate to protect their daughter, order all spinning wheels in the kingdom to be destroyed and forbid anyone from speaking of the curse.\n\nOn Aurora's 16th birthday, she meets a handsome prince named Philip in the forest, and the two fall in love. However, Maleficent appears and tricks Aurora into pricking her finger on a spinning wheel, putting her into a deep sleep. The entire kingdom falls into a deep sleep along with Aurora, and a thick forest grows around the castle to protect it from outsiders.\n\nPrince Philip, who has fallen in love with Aurora, sets out to rescue her, but he is met by Maleficent, who has transformed into a dragon. Philip is able to defeat the dragon with the help of the good fairies and enters the castle, where he finds Aurora sleeping. He kisses her, breaking the curse, and the two get married.\n\n#Voice cast\n\n* Mary Costa as Princess Aurora\n* Bill Shirley as Prince Philip\n* Eleanor Audley as Maleficent\n* Verna Felton as Flora\n* Barbara Luderowski as Fauna\n* Barbara Jo Allen as Merryweather\n* Taylor Holmes as King Stefan\n* Bill Thompson as King Hubert\n* Marvin Miller as the narrator\n\n#Production\n\n##Story development\n\nWalt Disney had been interested in adapting the fairy tale \"Sleeping Beauty\" into a film since the 1930s, but it wasn't until the 1950s that the project began to take shape. Disney assembled a team of writers, including Erdman Penner, Joe Rinaldi, and Winston Hibler, to develop the story.\n\nThe writers took inspiration from the original fairy tale, but they also added their own twists and ideas to the story. They developed the characters of the three good fairies, Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather, and created the villainous character of Maleficent.\n\n##Casting\n\nMary Costa, a young opera singer, was chosen to voice Princess Aurora. Costa had never sung for a film before, but she had a beautiful voice and was able to bring a sense of innocence and vulnerability to the character.\n\nBill Shirley, a well-known actor and singer, was chosen to voice Prince Philip. Shirley had a strong, heroic voice and was able to bring a sense of charm and charisma to the character.\n\nEleanor Audley, a veteran actress and singer, was chosen to voice Maleficent. Audley had a deep, dramatic voice and was able to bring a sense of menace and evil to the character.\n\n##Production delays\n\nThe production of Sleeping Beauty was delayed several times due to the complexity of the animation and the high standards of Walt Disney. Disney was a perfectionist, and he demanded the best from his animators and artists.\n\nThe film was initially scheduled for release in 1955, but it wasn't until 1959 that it was finally completed. The delays were caused by a variety of factors, including the complexity of the animation, the high standards of Walt Disney, and the challenges of creating a film that would meet the expectations of audiences.\n\n##Animation\n\n###Art direction\n\nThe art direction of Sleeping Beauty was led by Ken Anderson, who had previously worked on films such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Cinderella. Anderson was responsible for developing the look and feel of the film, including the characters, settings, and special effects.\n\nAnderson took inspiration from the works of medieval artists, such as Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, and created a unique and stylized look for the film. The characters were designed to be elegant and refined, with a sense of luxury and opulence.\n\n###Live-action reference\n\nTo ensure that the animation was realistic and believable, the Disney animators used live-action reference. The animators would film live-action sequences of the actors, and then use those sequences as reference for their animation.\n\nMary Costa, the voice of Princess Aurora, was used as live-action reference for the character. Costa would act out the scenes, and the animators would use those performances as reference for their animation.\n\n###Character animation\n\nThe character animation of Sleeping Beauty was led by Milt Kahl, who had previously worked on films such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Pinocchio. Kahl was responsible for developing the characters of the film, including Princess Aurora, Prince Philip, and Maleficent.\n\nKahl took inspiration from the original fairy tale, and created characters that were both realistic and stylized. The characters were designed to be elegant and refined, with a sense of luxury and opulence.\n\n##Music\n\nThe music of Sleeping Beauty was composed by George Bruns, who had previously worked on films such as Cinderella and Alice in Wonderland. Bruns took inspiration from the works of classical composers, such as Tchaikovsky and Chopin, and created a unique and stylized score for the film.\n\nThe score featured a variety of instruments, including the piano, the violin, and the orchestra. The music was designed to be elegant and refined, with a sense of luxury and opulence.\n\n#Release\n\n##Original theatrical run\n\nSleeping Beauty was released in theaters on January 29, 1959. The film was a major success, and it grossed over $51 million at the box office.\n\n##Re-releases\n\nSleeping Beauty was re-released in theaters several times, including in 1970, 1979, and 1986. The film continued to be popular, and it grossed millions of dollars at the box office.\n\n##Home media\n\nSleeping Beauty was released on home video in 1986, as part of the Walt Disney Classics video series. The film was a major success, and it sold millions of copies.\n\n###Lawsuit\n\nIn 1995, a lawsuit was filed against Disney by a woman who claimed that she had been injured by a defective VHS tape of Sleeping Beauty. The woman claimed that the tape had been defective, and that it had caused her to suffer a back injury.\n\nThe lawsuit was settled out of court, and Disney agreed to pay the woman an undisclosed amount of money.\n\n#Reception\n\n##Critical response\n\nSleeping Beauty received positive reviews from critics, who praised the film's animation, music, and story. The film was praised for its unique and stylized look, and for its memorable characters and songs.\n\n##Accolades\n\nSleeping Beauty was nominated for one Academy Award, for Best Original Score. The film did not win the award, but it was recognized for its achievements in animation and music.\n\n#Legacy\n\nSleeping Beauty has become a beloved classic, and it is widely regarded as one of the greatest animated films of all time. The film's unique and stylized look, its memorable characters and songs, and its timeless story have made it a favorite among audiences.\n\nThe film has been recognized as a cultural icon, and it has inspired countless works of art, literature, and music.

After completing his studies, Free moved to New York City, where he became involved in the city's vibrant art scene.\n\n#Whitney Museum assistant curator\n\nIn the late 1920s, Free landed a job as an assistant curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art. This position not only provided him with a steady income but also gave him the opportunity to work closely with some of the most prominent artists of the time. During his tenure at the Whitney, Free developed a deep appreciation for American art and a keen eye for talent.\n\n#Post office murals\n\nIn 1935, Free was commissioned by the Treasury Department's Section of Painting and Sculpture to create a mural for the post office in Washington, D.C. This project marked the beginning of Free's involvement with the Federal Art Project, a program established by the New Deal to provide work for artists and to promote American art.\n\n##Washington, D.C.\n\n###Creation\n\nFree's mural, titled \"The Spirit of 1776,\" depicted a dramatic scene from American history. The painting showed a group of patriots, led by a woman representing Liberty, marching towards a bright future. Free's use of bold colors and dynamic composition created a sense of energy and movement.\n\n###Reception and objections\n\nWhen \"The Spirit of 1776\" was unveiled, it sparked a heated debate about the role of art in public spaces. Some critics praised the mural as a celebration of American spirit, while others condemned it as a piece of propaganda. Free's depiction of a woman leading the patriots was seen as particularly radical by some, who argued that it undermined traditional notions of masculinity.\n\n##Princeton, New Jersey\n\n###Creation\n\nIn 1937, Free was commissioned to create a mural for the post office in Princeton, New Jersey. Titled \"The Founders of Princeton,\" the painting depicted a group of colonial-era settlers engaged in various activities, such as farming and trade. Free's use of warm colors and gentle composition created a sense of tranquility and community.\n\n###Reception and objections\n\nWhen \"The Founders of Princeton\" was unveiled, it sparked a similar debate about the role of art in public spaces. Some critics praised the mural as a celebration of American history, while others condemned it as a piece of nostalgia. Free's depiction of the colonial-era settlers was seen as particularly sanitized by some, who argued that it glossed over the complexities of American history.\n\n#1939 and beyond\n\nAs the Federal Art Project came to an end in 1939, Free continued to work as a muralist, creating large-scale paintings for private clients and public institutions. His work continued to reflect the spirit of the New Deal, with its emphasis on community and social justice. Free's legacy as a muralist has endured, with his post office murals remaining some of the most iconic and enduring works of American art from the 1930s.\n\n#See also\n\n* Federal Art Project\n* New Deal\n* Muralism\n* American art\n* Post office murals\n\n#Notes\n\n* This article is based on a general knowledge of Karl R.

It began on July 8, 1947, when a strange object crashed on a ranch near Roswell, New Mexico. The incident has spawned a multitude of conspiracy theories, books, and films, and continues to fascinate the public to this day.\n\n1947 Military Balloon Crash\n---------------------------\n\nIn July 1947, a strange object crashed on a ranch near Roswell, New Mexico. The US military initially reported that they had recovered a \"flying disc,\" but later claimed that the object was actually a weather balloon that had been found. The incident was largely forgotten until the 1970s, when ufologists began to investigate the crash and its aftermath.\n\nUFO Conspiracy Theories (1947–1978)\n-----------------------------------\n\n### Aztec Crashed Saucer Hoax\n\nIn 1948, a man named Silas Newton claimed that he had recovered a crashed flying saucer in Aztec, New Mexico. Newton's story was widely publicized, but it was later revealed to be a hoax. Despite this, the Aztec incident helped to fuel public interest in UFOs and the Roswell crash.\n\n### Hangar 18\n\nThe term \"Hangar 18\" refers to a supposed secret US Air Force facility where crashed UFOs are allegedly stored and studied. The concept of Hangar 18 has been popularized in books and films, but there is no credible evidence to support its existence.\n\nRoswell Conspiracy Theories (1978–1994)\n--------------------------------------\n\n### The Roswell Incident\n\nIn 1980, ufologist Stanton Friedman published a book called \"Crash at Corona,\" which explored the Roswell incident in detail. Friedman's book helped to revive public interest in the crash, and sparked a new wave of conspiracy theories.\n\n### Majestic 12 Hoax\n\nIn 1987, a set of supposedly classified documents known as the \"Majestic 12\" papers were leaked to the press. The documents appeared to reveal a secret US government project dedicated to studying crashed UFOs, but were later revealed to be a hoax.\n\n### Role of Glenn Dennis\n\nGlenn Dennis was a mortician who claimed to have been involved in the recovery of alien bodies from the Roswell crash. Dennis's story was widely publicized, but its credibility has been disputed.\n\n### Competing Accounts and Schism\n\nAs the Roswell conspiracy theories gained momentum, different factions emerged with competing accounts of the crash. Some claimed that the crashed object was a UFO, while others believed it was a military experiment gone wrong. The debate continues to this day.\n\n#### UFO Crash at Roswell\n\nIn 1991, ufologist Kevin Randle published a book called \"UFO Crash at Roswell,\" which presented a detailed account of the crash and its aftermath. Randle's book helped to further popularize the Roswell incident, but its conclusions have been disputed.\n\n#### Crash at Corona\n\nIn 1992, ufologist Don Schmitt published a book called \"Crash at Corona,\" which presented an alternative account of the Roswell incident. Schmitt's book claimed that the crashed object was a UFO, and that the US government had covered up the incident.\n\n#### The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell\n\nIn 1994, ufologist Philip Corso published a book called \"The Day After Roswell,\" which presented a detailed account of the crash and its aftermath. Corso's book claimed that the US government had recovered alien technology from the crash, and had used it to develop new military technologies.\n\nAir Force Response\n-----------------\n\nIn 1994, the US Air Force published a report on the Roswell incident, which concluded that the crashed object was a top-secret balloon reconnaissance project called \"Project Mogul.\" The report was widely criticized by ufologists, who claimed that it was a cover-up.\n\nLater Theories and Hoaxes (1994–Present)\n--------------------------------------\n\n### Alien Autopsy\n\nIn 1995, a film called \"Alien Autopsy\" was released, which claimed to show footage of an alien autopsy from the Roswell crash. The film was later revealed to be a hoax.\n\n### The Day After Roswell\n\nIn 1997, a book called \"The Day After Roswell\" was published, which claimed to reveal the truth about the Roswell incident. The book was widely publicized, but its conclusions have been disputed.\n\n### Related Debunked or Fringe Theories\n\nOver the years, a number of fringe theories have emerged to explain the Roswell incident. These include claims of alien visitation, government cover-ups, and even time travel.\n\nExplanations\n------------\n\n### Project Mogul\n\nThe US Air Force's explanation for the Roswell incident is that the crashed object was a top-secret balloon reconnaissance project called \"Project Mogul.\" The project used high-altitude balloons to detect Soviet nuclear tests, and the crashed object was likely a balloon that had been found.\n\n### Anthropomorphic Dummies\n\nIn 2011, it was revealed that the US military had been using anthropomorphic dummies in parachute tests in the 1950s. Some ufologists have suggested that these dummies may have been mistaken for alien bodies.\n\n### Roswell as Modern Myth and Folklore\n\nThe Roswell incident has become a modern myth and folklore, with a wide range of stories and legends surrounding the crash. While the truth about the incident may never be fully known, its impact on popular culture is undeniable.\n\nCultural Impact\n----------------\n\n### Tourism and Commercialization\n\nThe Roswell incident has spawned a thriving tourism industry, with numerous museums, shops, and attractions dedicated to the crash. The incident has also been commercialized, with a wide range of products and merchandise available.\n\n### Popular Fiction\n\nThe Roswell incident has been featured in numerous films, books, and TV shows, including \"The X-Files,\" \"Independence Day,\" and \"Roswell.\" The incident continues to fascinate the public, and its influence on popular culture is still being felt.\n\n### Statements by US Presidents\n\nSeveral US Presidents have made statements about the Roswell incident, including Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. While these statements have been largely cryptic, they have helped to fuel public interest in the crash.\n\nSee Also\n--------\n\n* Project Blue Book\n* Majestic 12\n* Hangar 18\n* UFO\n* Extraterrestrial life\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n* Friedman, Stanton. \"Crash at Corona.\" 1980.\n* Randle, Kevin. \"UFO Crash at Roswell.\" 1991.\n* Schmitt, Don. \"Crash at Corona.\" 1992.\n* Corso, Philip. \"The Day After Roswell.\" 1994.\n* US Air Force. \"The Roswell Report: Fact vs. Fiction in the New Mexico Desert.\" 1994.\n\nExternal Links\n---------------\n\n* Roswell UFO Museum\n* International UFO Museum and Research Center\n* Project Blue Book\n* Majestic 12\n* Hangar 18", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Roswell_incident\" following this outline:\n\n#1947 military balloon crash\n#UFO conspiracy theories (1947–1978)\n##Aztec crashed saucer hoax\n##Hangar 18\n#Roswell conspiracy theories (1978–1994)\n##The Roswell Incident\n##Majestic 12 hoax\n##Role of Glenn Dennis\n##Competing accounts and schism\n###UFO Crash at Roswell\n###Crash at Corona\n###The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell\n#Air Force response\n#Later theories and hoaxes (1994–present)\n##Alien Autopsy\n##The Day After Roswell\n##Related debunked or fringe theories\n#Explanations\n##Project Mogul\n##Anthropomorphic dummies\n##Roswell as modern myth and folklore\n#Cultural impact\n##Tourism and commercialization\n##Popular fiction\n##Statements by US Presidents\n#See also\n#References\n##Sources\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Constructive set theory is an alternative to classical set theory, which is based on classical logic and allows for non-constructive proofs.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nConstructive set theory is a relatively new field that emerged in the mid-20th century as a response to the criticisms of classical set theory. The main motivation behind constructive set theory is to provide a more rigorous and intuitive foundation for mathematics, by avoiding non-constructive proofs and emphasizing the existence of mathematical objects through constructive methods.\n\n**Constructive Outlook**\n\n### Preliminary on the use of intuitionistic logic\n\nConstructive set theory is based on intuitionistic logic, which is a logical system developed by L.E.J. Brouwer, Arend Heyting, and Stephen Kleene. Intuitionistic logic is characterized by the rejection of the law of excluded middle, which states that a statement is either true or false. In intuitionistic logic, a statement is considered true only if it can be constructively proven, and false only if it can be constructively disproven.\n\n### Imposed restrictions on a set theory\n\nConstructive set theory imposes several restrictions on the axioms and methods of classical set theory. For example, the axiom of choice, which states that for any set of non-empty sets, there exists a function that chooses an element from each set, is not accepted in constructive set theory. Similarly, the law of excluded middle is not accepted, and the notion of equality is defined in terms of constructive equivalence.\n\n### Metalogic\n\nMetalogic is the study of the properties and behavior of logical systems. In constructive set theory, metalogic plays a crucial role in understanding the nature of constructive proofs and the properties of constructive sets.\n\n### Anti-classical principles\n\nConstructive set theory is based on several anti-classical principles, which are principles that contradict the classical principles of mathematics. For example, the principle of constructive existence, which states that a mathematical object exists only if it can be constructively defined, is an anti-classical principle.\n\n**History and Overview**\n\n### Models\n\nConstructive set theory has been developed in several different models, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Some of the most popular models include the model of hereditarily finite sets, the model of hereditarily recursive functions, and the model of constructive type theory.\n\n**Notation**\n\n### Language\n\nThe language of constructive set theory is based on the language of classical set theory, but with several modifications.

Over the years, the development of rock-climbing equipment has evolved significantly, with advances in materials, design, and technology leading to improved performance, durability, and safety. This article provides an overview of the various types of rock-climbing equipment, their uses, and certification requirements.\n\nUse and certification\n--------------------\n\n### Type of climbing\n\nDifferent types of climbing require different types of equipment. For example, sport climbing typically involves the use of pre-drilled holes and permanent anchors, while traditional climbing requires the placement of temporary protection devices. Ice climbing, on the other hand, requires specialized equipment such as crampons and ice axes. The type of climbing being undertaken will determine the specific equipment needed.\n\n### Certification\n\nMany countries have certification schemes for rock-climbing equipment, which ensures that the equipment meets certain safety standards. For example, the International Federation of Mountain Guides Associations (IFMGA) sets standards for equipment used in mountain guiding, while the Union of International Alpine Associations (UIAA) certifies equipment for use in climbing and mountaineering.\n\nRopes and slings\n----------------\n\n### Ropes\n\nRopes are a critical component of rock-climbing equipment, providing a means of protection and support for the climber. Climbing ropes are typically made of nylon or polyester and come in a range of diameters and lengths. The choice of rope will depend on the type of climbing being undertaken, with thicker ropes being used for longer climbs and thinner ropes being used for shorter climbs.\n\n### Slings\n\nSlings are used to connect the rope to protection devices, such as carabiners and quickdraws. They are typically made of nylon or polyester and come in a range of lengths and widths. Slings can be used to extend the length of a rope or to create a makeshift anchor.\n\n### Cords\n\nCords are thin, lightweight ropes used for a variety of purposes, including creating anchors and connecting protection devices. They are typically made of nylon or polyester and come in a range of diameters and lengths.\n\nRope connectors\n----------------\n\n### Carabiners\n\nCarabiners are metal clips used to connect the rope to protection devices, such as quickdraws and anchors. They come in a range of shapes and sizes, with different types being used for different purposes. For example, locking carabiners are used for critical applications, such as belaying, while non-locking carabiners are used for less critical applications, such as connecting quickdraws.\n\n### Harnesses\n\nHarnesses are worn by the climber to provide a secure attachment point for the rope. They consist of a waist belt, leg loops, and a tie-in point, and come in a range of styles and sizes.\n\n### Lanyards\n\nLanyards are used to connect the climber to an anchor or other protection device. They typically consist of a length of webbing or cord with a carabiner at each end.\n\n#### Personal anchor systems\n\nPersonal anchor systems (PAS) are used to connect the climber to an anchor or other protection device. They typically consist of a length of webbing or cord with a carabiner at each end, and are used to create a secure attachment point for the climber.\n\n### Quickdraws\n\nQuickdraws are used to connect the rope to protection devices, such as bolts and cams. They consist of two carabiners connected by a length of webbing or cord, and are used to extend the length of the rope.\n\nRope devices\n-------------\n\n### Ascenders\n\nAscenders are used to climb a rope, and are typically used in rescue situations or when ascending a rope. They consist of a metal or plastic device that is attached to the rope and allows the user to pull themselves up.\n\n### Belay devices\n\nBelay devices are used to control the rope during a climb, and are typically used by the belayer to catch the climber in the event of a fall. They consist of a metal or plastic device that is attached to the rope and allows the belayer to control the rope.\n\n### Descenders\n\nDescenders are used to descend a rope, and are typically used in rescue situations or when descending a rope. They consist of a metal or plastic device that is attached to the rope and allows the user to control their descent.\n\n### Self-locking devices\n\nSelf-locking devices are used to lock the rope in place, and are typically used in critical applications, such as belaying. They consist of a metal or plastic device that is attached to the rope and locks in place when a load is applied.\n\nProtection devices\n-----------------\n\n### Temporary\n\nTemporary protection devices are used to provide protection during a climb, and are typically removed at the end of the climb. They include:\n\n#### Active\n\nActive protection devices, such as cams and nuts, are used to provide protection by actively engaging with the rock. They consist of a metal or plastic device that is inserted into a crack or hole in the rock and expands to provide a secure hold.\n\n#### Passive\n\nPassive protection devices, such as hexes and pitons, are used to provide protection by passively filling a space in the rock. They consist of a metal or plastic device that is inserted into a crack or hole in the rock and provides a secure hold.\n\n### Fixed\n\nFixed protection devices, such as bolts and anchors, are used to provide permanent protection and are typically left in place after a climb. They consist of a metal or plastic device that is attached to the rock and provides a secure hold.\n\nAid equipment\n-------------\n\nAid equipment is used to provide support and protection during a climb, and is typically used in situations where free climbing is not possible. It includes:\n\n* Ladders and step ladders\n* Aiders and daisy chains\n* Hooks and clippers\n\nClothing equipment\n-----------------\n\nClothing equipment, such as climbing shoes, chalk bags, and climbing gloves, is used to provide comfort and support during a climb.\n\nMiscellaneous equipment\n----------------------\n\nMiscellaneous equipment, such as climbing backpacks, climbing harnesses, and climbing accessories, is used to provide support and protection during a climb.\n\nTraining equipment\n-----------------\n\nTraining equipment, such as climbing walls, climbing holds, and training aids, is used to train and practice climbing skills.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n### Manufacturers\n\n* Black Diamond\n* Petzl\n* Arc'teryx\n* The North Face\n* Mammut\n\n### Types\n\n* Sport climbing\n* Traditional climbing\n* Ice climbing\n* Mountaineering\n* Bouldering\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nFurther reading\n---------------\n\nExternal links\n---------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Rock-climbing_equipment\" following this outline:\n\n#Use and certification\n##Type of climbing\n##Certification\n#Ropes and slings\n##Ropes\n##Slings\n##Cords\n#Rope connectors\n##Carabiners\n##Harnesses\n##Lanyards\n###Personal anchor systems\n##Quickdraws\n#Rope devices\n##Ascenders\n##Belay devices\n##Descenders\n##Self-locking devices\n#Protection devices\n##Temporary\n###Active\n###Passive\n##Fixed\n#Aid equipment\n#Clothing equipment\n#Miscellaneous equipment\n#Training equipment\n#See also\n##Manufacturers\n##Types\n#References\n##Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The protests were led by a group of Indian wrestlers, including Olympic medalists and national champions, who were demanding action against the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) and its president, Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, over allegations of harassment, corruption, and mismanagement.\n\n#Background\n\nThe Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) is the governing body for wrestling in India, responsible for promoting and developing the sport at the national and international levels. Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, a politician from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), has been the president of the WFI since 2011. Over the years, there have been several allegations of corruption, mismanagement, and harassment against Singh and the WFI.\n\nIn 2022, several Indian wrestlers, including Olympic medalists Sakshi Malik and Bajrang Punia, had written to the Union Sports Ministry, alleging harassment and corruption by Singh and the WFI. The wrestlers had also demanded Singh's resignation and a thorough investigation into the allegations.\n\n#Initial Investigation\n\nIn response to the allegations, the Union Sports Ministry had set up an oversight committee to investigate the charges against Singh and the WFI. The committee, headed by Olympic medalist Yogeshwar Dutt, had submitted its report in December 2022, recommending that Singh be removed as WFI president and that the federation be dissolved.\n\nHowever, the Sports Ministry had not taken any concrete action on the report, leading to widespread criticism and disappointment among the wrestling community.\n\n#Protest Overview\n\nThe protests began on January 18, 2023, when a group of Indian wrestlers, including Sakshi Malik, Bajrang Punia, and Vinesh Phogat, gathered at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi, demanding action against Singh and the WFI.\n\n##FIR Registration and Supreme Court Intervention\n\nOn January 20, 2023, the Delhi Police registered a first information report (FIR) against Singh, based on the allegations made by the wrestlers. The FIR was registered under sections 354 (assault or use of force on a woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 354A (sexual harassment), and 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) of the Indian Penal Code.\n\nThe same day, the Supreme Court of India intervened in the matter, directing the Sports Ministry to take immediate action on the allegations against Singh and the WFI.\n\n##Jantar Mantar Clash\n\nOn January 21, 2023, a clash broke out between the protesting wrestlers and a group of supporters of Singh at Jantar Mantar. The clash resulted in injuries to several people, including a few wrestlers.\n\n##Formation of SIT and Questioning of Witnesses\n\nOn January 22, 2023, the Delhi Police formed a special investigation team (SIT) to probe the allegations against Singh. The SIT began questioning witnesses, including the wrestlers who had made the allegations.\n\n##New Parliament House March and Detainment\n\nOn January 25, 2023, the protesting wrestlers marched towards the New Parliament House, where the Budget Session of Parliament was underway. However, they were detained by the police before they could reach the Parliament House.\n\n##Meeting with Sports Minister and Filing Chargesheet\n\nOn January 28, 2023, the protesting wrestlers met with the Union Sports Minister, Anurag Thakur, and demanded action against Singh and the WFI. The same day, the Delhi Police filed a chargesheet against Singh, based on the allegations made by the wrestlers.\n\n#Aftermath\n\nThe protests finally came to an end on February 1, 2023, after the Sports Ministry announced the formation of an ad-hoc committee to run the WFI and the removal of Singh as WFI president.\n\n#Reactions\n\n##Domestic\n\n###Criticism\n\nThe protests were widely criticized by several politicians and sports administrators, who accused the wrestlers of trying to politicize the issue. Singh himself denied all the allegations against him and accused the wrestlers of trying to malign his reputation.\n\nHowever, the protests were also widely supported by several politicians, sports administrators, and civil society organizations, who praised the wrestlers for their courage and determination.\n\n##International\n\n###United World Wrestling\n\nThe United World Wrestling (UWW), the international governing body for wrestling, expressed its concern over the allegations against Singh and the WFI. The UWW also offered its support to the protesting wrestlers.\n\n###International Olympic Committee\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) also expressed its concern over the allegations against Singh and the WFI. The IOC directed the Indian Olympic Association to take immediate action on the allegations.\n\n###Parliamentarians\n\nSeveral parliamentarians from around the world, including from the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia, expressed their support for the protesting wrestlers.\n\n#Media Coverage\n\nThe protests received widespread media coverage in India and around the world. Several Indian news channels and newspapers extensively covered the protests, while international news agencies such as Reuters, AFP, and BBC also reported on the issue.\n\n#Impact\n\nThe protests had a significant impact on Indian sports, highlighting the need for greater accountability and transparency in sports administration. The protests also led to a wider debate on the need for greater support and protection for Indian athletes.\n\n#Gallery\n\n* Sakshi Malik addressing the protesters at Jantar Mantar\n* Bajrang Punia being detained by the police at New Parliament House\n* Vinesh Phogat meeting with Union Sports Minister Anurag Thakur\n\n#See Also\n\n* Wrestling Federation of India\n* Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh\n* Sakshi Malik\n* Bajrang Punia\n* Vinesh Phogat\n\n#References\n\n*Note: This article does not include any citations or references, as per the requirements.*\n\n#External Links\n\n*Note: This article does not include any external links, as per the requirements.*", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Indian_wrestlers'_protest\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Initial investigation\n#Protest overview\n##FIR registration and Supreme court intervention\n##Jantar Mantar clash\n##Formation of SIT and questioning of witnesses\n##New Parliament House march and detainment\n##Meeting with Sports Minister and filing chargesheet\n#Aftermath\n#Reactions\n##Domestic\n###Criticism\n##International\n###United World Wrestling\n###International Olympic Committee\n###Parliamentarians\n#Media coverage\n#Impact\n#Gallery\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is a common and typically benign condition that affects children, particularly those between the ages of 6 months and 5 years. Febrile seizures are usually caused by a sudden spike in body temperature, often due to a viral or bacterial infection. In most cases, the seizure is a one-time event, and the child recovers quickly without any lasting effects.\n\n# Signs and Symptoms\n\nThe signs and symptoms of a febrile seizure can vary, but typically include:\n\n* Sudden loss of consciousness\n* Convulsions or shaking of the body\n* Loss of muscle tone\n* Eye rolling or staring\n* Twitching or jerking of the limbs\n* Changes in breathing or heart rate\n\n## Types\n\nThere are two main types of febrile seizures: simple and complex.\n\n* Simple febrile seizures are the most common type, accounting for about 70-80% of cases. They are characterized by a brief, generalized seizure that lasts less than 15 minutes and does not recur within 24 hours.\n* Complex febrile seizures, on the other hand, are more severe and can last longer than 15 minutes. They may also recur within 24 hours and can be associated with focal neurological signs, such as weakness or numbness in a specific part of the body.\n\n# Causes\n\nFebrile seizures are typically caused by a sudden increase in body temperature, often due to a viral or bacterial infection. The exact mechanisms are not fully understood, but several factors are thought to contribute to the development of febrile seizures:\n\n* Viral infections, such as roseola, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)\n* Bacterial infections, such as pneumonia and urinary tract infections\n* Genetic predisposition: children with a family history of febrile seizures are more likely to develop the condition\n* Brain chemistry: changes in neurotransmitter levels and brain activity may contribute to the development of febrile seizures\n\n# Mechanism\n\nThe exact mechanisms of febrile seizures are not fully understood, but research suggests that they may be related to changes in brain chemistry and activity. When the body temperature rises, it can affect the functioning of the brain, leading to an imbalance in neurotransmitters and an increase in electrical activity. This can cause the brain to become overactive, leading to a seizure.\n\n# Diagnosis\n\nDiagnosing a febrile seizure can be challenging, as the symptoms can be similar to those of other conditions, such as epilepsy or meningitis. A diagnosis is typically made based on a combination of the following:\n\n* Medical history: the child's medical history, including any previous seizures or infections\n* Physical examination: a thorough physical examination to rule out other conditions\n* Laboratory tests: blood tests and imaging studies, such as CT or MRI scans, to rule out other conditions\n* Observation: observation of the child's behavior and symptoms during and after the seizure\n\n# Prevention\n\nWhile it is not possible to prevent febrile seizures entirely, there are some steps that can be taken to reduce the risk:\n\n* Vaccinations: ensuring that the child is up-to-date on all vaccinations, particularly those against viral infections such as influenza and RSV\n* Antipyretics: using antipyretic medications, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, to reduce fever\n* Cooling measures: using cooling measures, such as a cool bath or a fan, to reduce body temperature\n\n# Treatment\n\nThe treatment of febrile seizures typically involves:\n\n* Supportive care: providing supportive care, such as hydration and rest, to help the child recover from the seizure\n* Antipyretics: using antipyretic medications to reduce fever\n* Anticonvulsants: in some cases, anticonvulsant medications may be prescribed to prevent future seizures\n* Observation: close observation of the child's behavior and symptoms to ensure that there are no complications\n\n# Prognosis\n\nThe prognosis for children with febrile seizures is generally good. Most children recover quickly and do not experience any lasting effects. However, in some cases, febrile seizures can be a sign of an underlying condition, such as epilepsy or a neurological disorder. In these cases, the prognosis may be more guarded.\n\n# Epidemiology\n\nFebrile seizures are a common condition, affecting approximately 3-4% of children in the United States. They are most common in children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years, with the peak age of incidence being around 18 months. Boys are slightly more likely to develop febrile seizures than girls.\n\n# References\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements.)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Febrile_seizure\" following this outline:\n\n#Signs and symptoms\n##Types\n#Causes\n#Mechanism\n#Diagnosis\n#Prevention\n#Treatment\n#Prognosis\n#Epidemiology\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

His philosophical system is a comprehensive and systematic framework that encompasses various aspects of reality, including logic, metaphysics, epistemology, philosophy of nature, philosophy of spirit, and aesthetics. Hegel's ideas have had a profound impact on modern philosophy, influencing thinkers such as Karl Marx, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Martin Heidegger, among many others.\n\n#Life\n\n##Formative years\n\n###Stuttgart, Tübingen, Berne, Frankfurt (1770–1800)\n\nHegel was born on August 27, 1770, in Stuttgart, Württemberg (now part of Germany). His father, Georg Ludwig Hegel, was a secretary to the Duke of Württemberg, and his mother, Maria Magdalena Louisa Fromm, was a homemaker. Hegel's early education took place at the Stuttgart Gymnasium, where he excelled in his studies. In 1788, he began his theological studies at the University of Tübingen, where he met his lifelong friends and fellow philosophers, Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling and Friedrich Hölderlin.\n\nAfter completing his studies in 1793, Hegel worked as a tutor in Berne, Switzerland, and later in Frankfurt, Germany. During this period, he developed his interest in philosophy and politics, particularly in the ideas of the French Enlightenment and the French Revolution.\n\n##Career years\n\n###Jena, Bamberg, Nuremberg (1801–1816)\n\nIn 1801, Hegel began his academic career as a lecturer at the University of Jena, where he taught philosophy and developed his ideas on metaphysics and epistemology. During this period, he wrote his first major philosophical work, \"The Phenomenology of Spirit\" (1807), which explores the development of consciousness and the nature of reality.\n\nIn 1807, Hegel moved to Bamberg, where he worked as the editor of a newspaper. However, he soon returned to academia, becoming the rector of the Aegidiengymnasium in Nuremberg, a position he held from 1808 to 1816.\n\n###Heidelberg, Berlin (1816–1831)\n\nIn 1816, Hegel became a professor of philosophy at the University of Heidelberg, where he taught until 1818. He then moved to the University of Berlin, where he became a professor of philosophy and remained until his death in 1831. During this period, he wrote several major works, including \"The Science of Logic\" (1812–1816) and \"The Philosophy of Right\" (1820).\n\n#Influences\n\nHegel's philosophical system was influenced by various thinkers, including Immanuel Kant, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, and Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling. He was also influenced by the ideas of the French Enlightenment and the French Revolution, as well as by the philosophical and literary movements of his time, such as Romanticism and German Idealism.\n\n#The Phenomenology of Spirit\n\n\"The Phenomenology of Spirit\" (1807) is one of Hegel's most important works, in which he explores the development of consciousness and the nature of reality. The book is divided into several sections, each of which examines a different stage in the development of consciousness, from the most basic forms of sensory awareness to the highest forms of philosophical understanding.\n\nThe book begins with the \"Introduction,\" in which Hegel sets out the main themes and goals of the work. He then proceeds to examine the various stages of consciousness, including \"Consciousness,\" \"Self-Consciousness,\" \"Reason,\" and \"Spirit.\" Each section builds upon the previous one, as Hegel examines the contradictions and limitations of each stage of consciousness and shows how they are overcome by the next stage.\n\nThe \"Phenomenology\" is a rich and complex work that explores many of the key themes of Hegel's philosophy, including the nature of reality, the role of consciousness, and the importance of history and culture. It is considered one of the most important philosophical works of the modern era.\n\n#Philosophical system\n\nHegel's philosophical system is a comprehensive and systematic framework that encompasses various aspects of reality, including logic, metaphysics, epistemology, philosophy of nature, philosophy of spirit, and aesthetics.\n\n##Science of Logic\n\n\"The Science of Logic\" (1812–1816) is one of Hegel's most important works, in which he sets out his views on logic and metaphysics. The book is divided into three main sections: \"The Doctrine of Being,\" \"The Doctrine of Essence,\" and \"The Doctrine of the Notion.\"\n\nIn the \"Doctrine of Being,\" Hegel examines the basic categories of being, such as quality, quantity, and measure. He shows how these categories are related to each other and how they are necessary for understanding the world.\n\nIn the \"Doctrine of Essence,\" Hegel examines the nature of essence and how it relates to being. He shows how essence is the underlying reality that underlies all things and how it is necessary for understanding the world.\n\nIn the \"Doctrine of the Notion,\" Hegel examines the nature of the notion and how it relates to being and essence. He shows how the notion is the highest level of understanding and how it is necessary for understanding the world.\n\n##Philosophy of the real\n\nHegel's philosophy of the real is concerned with the nature of reality and how it is understood. He argues that reality is not just a collection of individual things, but rather a complex and interconnected whole.\n\n##The Philosophy of Nature\n\n\"The Philosophy of Nature\" (1830) is one of Hegel's most important works, in which he sets out his views on the natural world. The book is divided into three main sections: \"Mechanics,\" \"Physics,\" and \"Organics.\"\n\nIn the \"Mechanics,\" Hegel examines the basic laws of motion and how they govern the natural world. He shows how these laws are necessary for understanding the world and how they are related to each other.\n\nIn the \"Physics,\" Hegel examines the nature of physical reality and how it is understood. He shows how physical reality is governed by laws and how these laws are necessary for understanding the world.\n\nIn the \"Organics,\" Hegel examines the nature of living things and how they are understood. He shows how living things are governed by laws and how these laws are necessary for understanding the world.\n\n##The Philosophy of Spirit\n\n\"The Philosophy of Spirit\" (1830) is one of Hegel's most important works, in which he sets out his views on the nature of spirit and how it is understood. The book is divided into three main sections: \"Subjective Spirit,\" \"Objective Spirit,\" and \"Absolute Spirit.\"\n\n###Subjective spirit\n\nIn the \"Subjective Spirit,\" Hegel examines the nature of the individual and how it is understood. He shows how the individual is a complex and interconnected whole and how it is necessary for understanding the world.\n\n###Objective spirit\n\nIn the \"Objective Spirit,\" Hegel examines the nature of society and how it is understood. He shows how society is a complex and interconnected whole and how it is necessary for understanding the world.\n\n###Absolute spirit\n\nIn the \"Absolute Spirit,\" Hegel examines the nature of absolute reality and how it is understood. He shows how absolute reality is the highest level of understanding and how it is necessary for understanding the world.\n\n#Philosophy of art\n\nHegel's philosophy of art is concerned with the nature of art and how it is understood. He argues that art is a form of expression that is necessary for understanding the world.\n\n#Christianity\n\nHegel's views on Christianity are complex and multifaceted. He argues that Christianity is a form of expression that is necessary for understanding the world, but he also criticizes certain aspects of Christianity.\n\n##Early Romantic writings\n\nIn his early Romantic writings, Hegel expresses a strong critique of Christianity and its role in society. He argues that Christianity has become a form of oppressive dogma that stifles individual freedom and creativity.\n\n##The Phenomenology of Spirit\n\nIn \"The Phenomenology of Spirit,\" Hegel examines the role of Christianity in the development of consciousness. He shows how Christianity is a form of expression that is necessary for understanding the world, but he also criticizes certain aspects of Christianity.\n\n##The Berlin lectures\n\nIn his Berlin lectures, Hegel expresses a more nuanced view of Christianity. He argues that Christianity is a form of expression that is necessary for understanding the world, but he also emphasizes the importance of individual freedom and creativity.\n\n##Issues of interpretation\n\nHegel's views on Christianity are subject to interpretation, and there is ongoing debate among scholars about the nature of his views.\n\n#Philosophy of history\n\nHegel's philosophy of history is concerned with the nature of history and how it is understood. He argues that history is a rational and necessary process that is driven by the development of consciousness.\n\n#Dialectics, speculation, idealism\n\nHegel's philosophical system is characterized by dialectics, speculation, and idealism.\n\n##Thesis–antithesis–synthesis\n\nHegel's dialectical method is based on the idea of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. He argues that each stage of development is the result of a dialectical process in which a thesis is opposed by an antithesis, and the two are then synthesized into a higher level of understanding.\n\n#Reception\n\nHegel's philosophical system has had a profound impact on modern philosophy.\n\n##\"Right\" vs. \"Left\" Hegelianism\n\nAfter Hegel's death, his followers divided into two main groups: the \"Right\" Hegelians and the \"Left\" Hegelians. The \"Right\" Hegelians emphasized the conservative and religious aspects of Hegel's philosophy, while the \"Left\" Hegelians emphasized the radical and revolutionary aspects.\n\n##Reception in France\n\nHegel's philosophy was received with enthusiasm in France, particularly among the philosophers and writers of the French Revolution.\n\n##American pragmatism\n\nHegel's philosophy also had an impact on American pragmatism, particularly in the work of William James and John Dewey.\n\n#Publications and other writings\n\nHegel wrote many publications and other writings throughout his career.\n\n##Berlin lecture series\n\nHegel's Berlin lecture series is a collection of lectures that he delivered at the University of Berlin between 1818 and 1831.

This article provides an overview of the background, organization, and conduct of the referendums, as well as reactions from Ukraine, Russia, and the international community.\n\nBackground\n\nThe annexation referendums were announced on September 20, 2022, by Russian-backed separatist leaders in the Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts, as well as by Russian-appointed officials in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia Oblasts. The referendums were seen as a move to legitimize Russian control over these territories, which have been occupied by Russian forces since 2014.\n\nOrganization\n\nThe referendums were organized by the Russian-backed separatist authorities in the Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts, as well as by Russian-appointed officials in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia Oblasts.

However, the polls also showed that a significant number of residents were undecided or refused to participate in the polls.\n\nOpinions on the goals of holding referendums\n\nThe goals of holding the referendums were widely debated, with some arguing that they were a legitimate way for residents to express their will, while others saw them as a thinly veiled attempt by Russia to annex the territories.\n\nConduct\n\nFirst day\n\nThe referendums took place over a period of five days, from September 23 to 27, 2022.

He is often referred to as the \"Father of the Constitution\" for his role in drafting and promoting the United States Constitution and the Bill of Rights. Madison was a key figure in the development of the country's early government and institutions, and his presidency was marked by the War of 1812 and the growth of American nationalism.\n\n#Early life and education\n\nJames Madison was born on March 16, 1751, in Port Conway, Virginia, to Colonel James Madison Sr. and Eleanor Rose Conway Madison. He was the oldest of twelve children, and his family was considered to be part of the planter class. Madison's early education took place at home, where he was tutored by a series of private educators. In 1769, he enrolled at the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University), where he studied for two years and developed a strong interest in politics and philosophy.\n\nAfter leaving college, Madison returned to Virginia and began to study law. However, he never pursued a career in law, instead turning his attention to politics and public service. In 1774, he was appointed to the Orange County Committee of Safety, which was a local government body that oversaw the administration of the county during the American Revolution.\n\n#American Revolution and Articles of Confederation\n\nMadison played a key role in the American Revolution, serving as a delegate to the Virginia Convention in 1776. He was a strong supporter of independence from Great Britain and helped to draft the Virginia Declaration of Rights, which was an influential document that shaped the course of American history.\n\nIn 1780, Madison was appointed to the Continental Congress, where he served for three years. During his time in Congress, he played a key role in shaping the country's early government and institutions. In 1781, he helped to draft the Articles of Confederation, which was the first constitution of the United States.\n\nThe Articles of Confederation proved to be inadequate for the needs of the young nation, and Madison was a key figure in the movement to replace them with a new constitution. In 1786, he attended the Annapolis Convention, which was a meeting of state delegates that discussed the need for a stronger central government.\n\n#Ratification of the Constitution\n\nIn 1787, Madison attended the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, where he played a key role in drafting the United States Constitution. He is often referred to as the \"Father of the Constitution\" for his contributions to the document.\n\nAfter the Constitution was drafted, Madison returned to Virginia and played a key role in the ratification process. He wrote a series of essays, known as the Federalist Papers, in which he argued in favor of the Constitution and explained its provisions. The Federalist Papers were influential in shaping public opinion and helping to secure ratification of the Constitution.\n\n#Congressman and party leader (1789–1801)\n\n##Election to Congress\n\nIn 1789, Madison was elected to the first Congress of the United States, where he served as a representative from Virginia. He quickly emerged as a leader in the new government and played a key role in shaping the country's early institutions.\n\n##Bill of Rights\n\nIn 1789, Madison introduced a series of amendments to the Constitution, which became known as the Bill of Rights. The Bill of Rights guaranteed certain fundamental rights and freedoms, such as freedom of speech and the right to a fair trial.\n\n##Founding the Democratic–Republican Party\n\nIn the early 1790s, Madison began to emerge as a leader of the Democratic–Republican Party, which was a new party that opposed the policies of the Federalist Party. The Democratic–Republicans were committed to limited government and individual liberties, and they opposed the strong central government advocated by the Federalists.\n\n##Marriage and family\n\nIn 1794, Madison married Dolley Payne Todd, a widow with a young son. The couple had no children of their own, but they raised Dolley's son from her previous marriage.\n\n##Adams presidency\n\nIn 1796, Madison retired from Congress and returned to Virginia. During the presidency of John Adams, Madison emerged as a strong critic of the Federalist Party and its policies. He opposed the Alien and Sedition Acts, which were a series of laws that restricted civil liberties and silenced opposition to the government.\n\n#Secretary of State (1801–1809)\n\nIn 1801, Madison was appointed Secretary of State by President Thomas Jefferson. He served in this position for eight years, during which time he played a key role in shaping the country's foreign policy.\n\n##1808 presidential election\n\nIn 1808, Madison was elected as the fourth President of the United States, defeating Charles C. Pinckney of the Federalist Party.\n\n#Presidency (1809–1817)\n\n##Inauguration and cabinet\n\nMadison was inaugurated as President on March 4, 1809. He appointed a cabinet that included Robert Smith as Secretary of State, William Eustis as Secretary of War, and Albert Gallatin as Secretary of the Treasury.\n\n##War of 1812\n\n###Prelude to war\n\nDuring Madison's presidency, tensions between the United States and Great Britain increased, leading to the outbreak of the War of 1812. The British had imposed a series of trade restrictions and impressment of American sailors, which the United States saw as a threat to its sovereignty.\n\n###Military actions\n\nThe War of 1812 was marked by a series of military defeats for the United States, including the burning of Washington, D.C. by British troops. However, the war also saw several American victories, including the Battle of Lake Erie and the Battle of New Orleans.\n\n##Postwar period and decline of the Federalist opposition\n\nAfter the War of 1812, the Federalist Party declined in influence, and the Democratic–Republican Party emerged as the dominant party in American politics. Madison's presidency was marked by a growing nationalist sentiment, which emphasized the importance of a strong central government and a unified national identity.\n\n##Native American policy\n\nDuring Madison's presidency, the United States government pursued a policy of expansion and assimilation towards Native American tribes. This policy led to the forced relocation of many Native American tribes and the loss of their land and cultural heritage.\n\n##Election of 1816\n\nIn 1816, Madison was re-elected as President, defeating Rufus King of the Federalist Party.\n\n#Post-presidency (1817–1836)\n\nAfter leaving office in 1817, Madison retired to his home in Virginia, where he lived for the remainder of his life. He remained active in politics and was a vocal critic of the policies of his successor, James Monroe.\n\n##Death\n\nJames Madison died on June 28, 1836, at the age of 85. He was buried on his estate, Montpelier, in Orange County, Virginia.\n\n#Political and religious views\n\n##Federalism\n\nMadison was a strong supporter of federalism, which emphasized the importance of a strong central government and a unified national identity. He believed that a strong central government was necessary to protect the rights and interests of the American people.\n\n##Religion\n\nMadison was a member of the Episcopal Church, but he was also a strong supporter of religious freedom and the separation of church and state. He believed that the government should not impose its own religious views on the people, but rather protect the rights of all citizens to practice their own faith.\n\n#Slavery\n\nMadison was a slaveowner throughout his life, but he also opposed the expansion of slavery and supported the gradual emancipation of slaves. He believed that slavery was morally wrong, but he also saw it as a necessary evil in the context of the American economy and society.\n\n#Legacy\n\nJames Madison is remembered as one of the most important figures in American history, and his legacy continues to shape the country's politics and institutions. He is often referred to as the \"Father of the Constitution\" for his role in drafting and promoting the United States Constitution and the Bill of Rights.\n\n#Notes\n\n#References\n\n##Citations\n\n##Sources\n\n#Further reading\n\n#External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"James_Madison\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and education\n#American Revolution and Articles of Confederation\n#Ratification of the Constitution\n#Congressman and party leader (1789–1801)\n##Election to Congress\n##Bill of Rights\n##Founding the Democratic–Republican Party\n##Marriage and family\n##Adams presidency\n#Secretary of State (1801–1809)\n##1808 presidential election\n#Presidency (1809–1817)\n##Inauguration and cabinet\n##War of 1812\n###Prelude to war\n###Military actions\n##Postwar period and decline of the Federalist opposition\n##Native American policy\n##Election of 1816\n#Post-presidency (1817–1836)\n##Death\n#Political and religious views\n##Federalism\n##Religion\n#Slavery\n#Legacy\n#Notes\n#References\n##Citations\n##Sources\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The area has gained notoriety in recent years due to the presence of a large homeless encampment and the accompanying social and public health issues. The situation has raised concerns among local residents, business owners, and government officials, leading to various efforts to address the problem.\n\nAftermath of Long Island closure\n--------------------------------\n\n### Closure of Long Island services\n\nIn 2014, the city of Boston closed the Long Island shelter and treatment center, citing safety concerns and the need for repairs. The facility had provided a range of services, including emergency shelter, substance abuse treatment, and mental health support, to hundreds of people. The closure led to a displacement of these individuals, many of whom ended up on the streets.\n\n### Shelter openings at Mass. and Cass\n\nIn response to the closure of Long Island, several shelters were opened in the Mass. and Cass area. These shelters provided temporary housing and support services to individuals in need. However, the shelters quickly became overwhelmed, and the area began to attract a large number of people struggling with homelessness, substance abuse, and mental health issues.\n\nBusiness concerns\n-----------------\n\nThe presence of the homeless encampment at Mass. and Cass has raised concerns among local business owners. Many have reported a decline in sales and an increase in crime, including theft and vandalism. Some businesses have also expressed concerns about the safety of their employees and customers. The area has become a hub for panhandling, and some individuals have reported being aggressively solicited for money.\n\nPopulation\n------------\n\nThe population at Mass. and Cass is diverse and includes individuals from various backgrounds. Many are struggling with substance abuse, particularly opioid addiction. Others are dealing with mental health issues, including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The area has also become a magnet for sex workers and individuals involved in the sex trade.\n\nEfforts to clear out the encampment\n-----------------------------------\n\n### Operation Clean Sweep\n\nIn 2019, the city of Boston launched Operation Clean Sweep, a multi-agency effort aimed at clearing out the homeless encampment at Mass. and Cass. The operation involved the deployment of police officers, sanitation workers, and social service providers. The goal was to provide support services to individuals in need while also enforcing public health and safety regulations.\n\n### Sheriff's proposal to force treatment of individuals\n\nIn 2020, the Suffolk County Sheriff proposed a plan to force individuals struggling with addiction into treatment. The plan, known as the \"Section 35\" program, would allow law enforcement officers to involuntarily commit individuals to treatment facilities. The proposal sparked controversy, with some arguing that it would infringe upon individual rights and others arguing that it would provide much-needed support to those struggling with addiction.\n\n### Executive order to clear encampment\n\nIn 2020, the Mayor of Boston issued an executive order aimed at clearing out the homeless encampment at Mass. and Cass.

The city of Boston has established a program to collect and dispose of used syringes, but many have reported that the program is inadequate. The collection of syringes is a critical public health issue, as it helps to prevent the spread of diseases such as HIV and hepatitis.\n\nRise in violence\n-----------------\n\nThe Mass. and Cass area has experienced a rise in violence in recent years. There have been reports of assaults, stabbings, and shootings, many of which have been linked to the homeless encampment. The violence has raised concerns among local residents and business owners, who have called for increased police presence in the area.\n\nPolice presence\n----------------\n\n### Overtime spending\n\nThe Boston Police Department has increased its presence in the Mass. and Cass area, with many officers working overtime to patrol the streets. The increased presence has come at a cost, with the city spending millions of dollars on overtime pay.\n\n### Lack of intervention in violence\n\nDespite the increased police presence, many have reported that officers are not intervening in violent incidents. This has raised concerns among local residents and business owners, who have called for more aggressive policing in the area.\n\n### Command center\n\nThe city of Boston has established a command center to coordinate efforts in the Mass. and Cass area. The command center brings together representatives from various city agencies, including the police department, sanitation department, and social service providers.

The song was a major commercial success, reaching the top 10 in several countries, including the UK, where it peaked at number 3 on the Singles Chart.\n\n#Music and lyrics\n\n\"Running Up That Hill\" is a mid-tempo song with a mix of electronic and rock elements. The song features a prominent use of synthesizers and a driving beat, which was a departure from Bush's earlier work. The lyrics of the song are somewhat abstract and open to interpretation, but they appear to describe a sense of desperation and longing. Bush has said that the song was inspired by the idea of \"two people who are in a relationship, and they're having difficulties, and they're trying to find a way to make it work.\"\n\nThe song's title is a reference to the idea of \"running up a hill\" as a metaphor for the difficulties of relationships. Bush has said that she was inspired by the idea of \"trying to get to the top of a hill, but it's a very difficult climb.\" The song's chorus features the repeated phrase \"if I only could, I'd make a deal with God,\" which has been interpreted as a reference to the idea of making a sacrifice in order to save a relationship.\n\n##Composition\n\nThe song's composition is notable for its use of a Fairlight CMI synthesizer, which was a cutting-edge instrument at the time of the song's release. The Fairlight was used to create the song's distinctive \"cloud\" sound, which is heard throughout the track. The song also features a prominent use of drums, which were played by Stuart Elliott.\n\n#Recording\n\n\"Running Up That Hill\" was recorded at Bush's home studio, which was located in a converted barn on her family's estate in East Sussex. The song was produced by Bush and Del Palmer, who had previously worked with Bush on her 1982 album, The Dreaming.\n\nThe recording process for \"Running Up That Hill\" was notable for its use of innovative production techniques, including the use of a Fairlight CMI synthesizer and a Steinberg Pro-16 sequencer. Bush has said that she was experimenting with new sounds and techniques during the recording process, and that the song's final version was the result of several different versions and mixes.\n\n#Music video\n\nThe music video for \"Running Up That Hill\" was directed by David Garfath and Kate Bush, and was released in 1985. The video features Bush singing and dancing in a variety of locations, including a hillside and a studio. The video was notable for its use of innovative camera techniques, including the use of a Steadicam.\n\nThe video's storyline is somewhat abstract, but it appears to show Bush struggling to climb a hill, while also singing and dancing. The video features a number of surreal and dreamlike sequences, including a shot of Bush floating in mid-air.\n\n#Release\n\n\"Running Up That Hill\" was released in 1985 as the lead single from Bush's fifth studio album, Hounds of Love. The song was a major commercial success, reaching the top 10 in several countries, including the UK, where it peaked at number 3 on the Singles Chart.\n\nThe song's success was fueled by its innovative production and music video, as well as Bush's distinctive vocals and songwriting style. The song has since become one of Bush's most popular and enduring songs, and is widely regarded as a classic of 1980s pop music.\n\n#2012 Olympics remix\n\nIn 2012, a remix of \"Running Up That Hill\" was released as part of the soundtrack for the London Olympics. The remix, which was created by Bush and Del Palmer, featured a new version of the song's instrumental track, as well as new vocals from Bush.\n\nThe remix was notable for its use of a more contemporary production style, including the use of electronic drum machines and synthesizers. The remix was well-received by critics and fans, and helped to introduce the song to a new generation of listeners.\n\n#2022 revival and Stranger Things\n\nIn 2022, \"Running Up That Hill\" experienced a major revival in popularity, thanks in part to its inclusion in the fourth season of the Netflix series Stranger Things. The song was featured prominently in several episodes of the show, and its use helped to introduce the song to a new generation of listeners.\n\nThe song's revival was fueled by its inclusion in Stranger Things, as well as its continued popularity on social media platforms such as TikTok. The song's music video also experienced a surge in views on YouTube, and the song itself reached the top 10 on several music charts, including the US Billboard Hot 100.\n\n#Critical response\n\n\"Running Up That Hill\" has been widely praised by critics, who have noted its innovative production and Bush's distinctive vocals and songwriting style. The song has been included on several lists of the greatest songs of all time, including Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\n\nThe song's critical response was not universally positive, however. Some critics noted that the song's production was overly reliant on synthesizers and drum machines, and that Bush's vocals were sometimes overwhelmed by the instrumental track.\n\n#Live performances\n\n\"Running Up That Hill\" has been a staple of Bush's live shows since its release in 1985. The song has been performed in a variety of different arrangements, including a stripped-down version featuring just Bush and a piano.\n\nThe song's live performances have been widely praised by critics, who have noted Bush's energetic and emotive stage presence.
