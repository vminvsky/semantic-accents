These gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, trap heat from the sun, leading to a rise in global temperatures. The effects of climate change are far-reaching and multifaceted, impacting various aspects of the environment, human societies, and the economy.\n\n# Changes in Temperature\n\nOne of the most direct and visible effects of climate change is the increase in global temperatures. The average global temperature has risen by about 1°C since the late 19th century, and the 20 warmest years on record have all occurred since 1981. This warming trend is not uniform, with some regions experiencing more rapid warming than others. The Arctic, for example, is warming at a rate twice as fast as the global average.\n\n## Heat Waves and Temperature Extremes\n\nHeat waves and temperature extremes are becoming more frequent and prolonged due to climate change. Heat waves are periods of abnormally hot weather that can last for several days or even weeks. They can have devastating impacts on human health, particularly for vulnerable populations such as the elderly and young children. Temperature extremes can also have significant effects on ecosystems and biodiversity.\n\n## Rain\n\nChanges in precipitation patterns are another consequence of climate change. Some regions are experiencing more frequent and intense rainfall events, while others are facing droughts and water scarcity. This can lead to flooding, landslides, and other natural disasters. Climate change is also altering the distribution and abundance of rainfall around the world, with some areas receiving more rainfall than others.\n\n## Extreme Storms\n\nClimate change is also linked to an increase in extreme storms, such as hurricanes, typhoons, and cyclones. These storms are fueled by warmer ocean temperatures and can have catastrophic impacts on coastal communities and ecosystems. Rising sea levels and more frequent storm surges can exacerbate the damage caused by these storms.\n\n# Land\n\nClimate change is having significant impacts on the land, including changes in weather patterns, sea level rise, and increased risk of natural disasters.\n\n## Floods\n\nFlooding is becoming more frequent and severe due to climate change. Rising sea levels and more frequent storm surges are causing coastal flooding, while heavy rainfall events are leading to inland flooding. Flooding can have devastating impacts on human settlements, infrastructure, and ecosystems.\n\n## Droughts\n\nDroughts are becoming more frequent and prolonged due to climate change. Changes in precipitation patterns and increased evaporation due to warmer temperatures are contributing to droughts. Droughts can have significant impacts on agriculture, water resources, and ecosystems.\n\n## Wildfires\n\nClimate change is also linked to an increase in wildfires, particularly in regions with rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns. Wildfires can have devastating impacts on ecosystems, human settlements, and the economy.\n\n# Oceans\n\nThe oceans are playing a critical role in the Earth's climate system, and climate change is having significant impacts on marine ecosystems.\n\n## Sea Level Rise\n\nSea level rise is one of the most visible and well-documented effects of climate change. The global sea level has risen by about 15-20 cm since 1900, and the rate of sea level rise is accelerating. Sea level rise is caused by the melting of glaciers and ice sheets, as well as the thermal expansion of seawater.\n\n# Ice and Snow\n\nClimate change is having significant impacts on the Earth's ice and snow, including glaciers, ice sheets, sea ice, and permafrost.\n\n## Glaciers Decline\n\nGlaciers are declining at an unprecedented rate due to climate change. Glaciers are sensitive to changes in temperature and precipitation patterns, and many are retreating or disappearing altogether. Glaciers play a critical role in regulating sea levels and providing freshwater resources.\n\n## Ice Sheets Decline\n\nThe ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica are also declining due to climate change. These ice sheets contain about 75% of the world's freshwater and play a critical role in regulating sea levels. The decline of the ice sheets is accelerating, and the impacts could be catastrophic.\n\n## Sea Ice Decline\n\nSea ice is declining at an unprecedented rate due to climate change. Sea ice plays a critical role in regulating the Earth's climate, and its decline is having significant impacts on marine ecosystems and global weather patterns.\n\n## Permafrost Thawing\n\nPermafrost is thawing at an unprecedented rate due to climate change. Permafrost contains large amounts of carbon dioxide and methane, which are released as the permafrost thaws. This can accelerate climate change and have significant impacts on ecosystems and human settlements.\n\n# Wildlife and Nature\n\nClimate change is having significant impacts on wildlife and ecosystems, including changes in species distribution, behavior, and extinction risk.\n\n## Ecosystems on Land\n\nClimate change is altering the distribution and abundance of ecosystems on land, including forests, grasslands, and deserts. Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns are causing some ecosystems to shift poleward or to higher elevations.\n\n## Marine Ecosystems\n\nClimate change is also having significant impacts on marine ecosystems, including coral reefs, estuaries, and open ocean ecosystems. Changes in ocean temperature and chemistry are causing some marine ecosystems to shift poleward or to deeper waters.\n\n# Tipping Points and Irreversible Impacts\n\nClimate change is approaching several tipping points, beyond which the impacts could be catastrophic and irreversible. These tipping points include the melting of the Arctic ice cap, the collapse of coral reefs, and the die-off of the Amazon rainforest.\n\n# Health, Food Security and Water Security\n\nClimate change is having significant impacts on human health, food security, and water security.\n\n## Health\n\nClimate change is increasing the spread of disease, heat stress, and other health problems. Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns are altering the distribution of disease vectors, such as mosquitoes and ticks.\n\n## Food Security\n\nClimate change is altering the distribution and abundance of food crops, including wheat, corn, and soybeans. Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns are causing some crops to shift poleward or to higher elevations.\n\n## Water Security\n\nClimate change is altering the distribution and abundance of freshwater resources, including rivers, lakes, and aquifers. Changes in precipitation patterns and increased evaporation due to warmer temperatures are contributing to droughts and water scarcity.\n\n# Human Settlements\n\nClimate change is having significant impacts on human settlements, including changes in weather patterns, sea level rise, and increased risk of natural disasters.\n\n## Impacts from Heat\n\nClimate change is increasing the frequency and severity of heat waves, which can have devastating impacts on human health and settlements.\n\n## Low-Lying Coastal Regions\n\nRising sea levels and more frequent storm surges are causing coastal flooding and erosion, which can have devastating impacts on human settlements and infrastructure.\n\n# Impacts on Societies\n\nClimate change is having significant impacts on societies, including displacement and migration, conflict, and social impacts on vulnerable groups.\n\n## Displacement and Migration\n\nClimate change is causing displacement and migration, particularly in low-lying coastal regions and areas with high levels of poverty and inequality.\n\n## Conflict\n\nClimate change is contributing to conflict, particularly over resources such as water and land.\n\n## Social Impacts on Vulnerable Groups\n\nClimate change is having significant social impacts on vulnerable groups, including the elderly, children, and indigenous communities.\n\n## Possibility of Societal Collapse\n\nClimate change is raising the possibility of societal collapse, particularly if the impacts are catastrophic and irreversible.\n\n# Economic Impacts\n\nClimate change is having significant economic impacts, including economic inequality and highly affected sectors.\n\n## Economic Inequality\n\nClimate change is exacerbating economic inequality, particularly in regions with high levels of poverty and inequality.\n\n## Highly Affected Sectors\n\nClimate change is having significant impacts on highly affected sectors, including agriculture, forestry, and tourism.\n\n# See Also\n\n* Climate change\n* Global warming\n* Greenhouse effect\n* Climate change mitigation\n* Climate change adaptation\n\n# References\n\n* Sources:\n\t+ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)\n\t+ National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)\n\t+ National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)\n\t+ United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)\n\n# External Links\n\n* Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)\n* National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)\n* National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)\n* United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Effects_of_climate_change\" following this outline:\n\n#Changes in temperature\n#Weather\n##Heat waves and temperature extremes\n##Rain\n##Extreme storms\n#Land\n##Floods\n##Droughts\n##Wildfires\n#Oceans\n##Sea level rise\n#Ice and snow\n##Glaciers decline\n##Ice sheets decline\n##Sea ice decline\n##Permafrost thawing\n#Wildlife and nature\n##Ecosystems on land\n##Marine ecosystems\n#Tipping points and irreversible impacts\n#Health, food security and water security\n##Health\n##Food security\n##Water security\n#Human settlements\n##Impacts from heat\n##Low-lying coastal regions\n#Impacts on societies\n##Displacement and migration\n##Conflict\n##Social impacts on vulnerable groups\n##Possibility of societal collapse\n#Economic impacts\n##Economic inequality\n##Highly affected sectors\n#See also\n#References\n##Sources\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born in the early 20th century, Stelaru rose to prominence in the interwar period, only to face repression and persecution during World War II. Despite these challenges, he continued to write, leaving behind a legacy of literary works that remain significant in Romanian cultural heritage.\n\n# Biography\n\n## Early life\n\nDimitrie Stelaru was born on February 9, 1917, in Bucharest, Romania, to a family of modest means. His parents, both educated and culturally inclined, encouraged his early interest in literature and the arts. Stelaru's father, a civil servant, was an avid reader and writer, who exposed his son to the works of classical Romanian authors, such as Mihai Eminescu and Ion Luca Caragiale.\n\nGrowing up in a culturally rich environment, Stelaru developed a passion for writing at an early age. He began composing poetry and short stories, which he shared with his family and friends. This early creative outlet helped shape his unique voice and perspective, laying the foundation for his future literary endeavors.\n\n## Debut and death-hoax\n\nIn 1935, Stelaru published his first collection of poetry, \"Sonete\" (Sonnets), which garnered attention from literary critics and established him as a rising talent in Romanian literature. Encouraged by this success, he continued to write, experimenting with different genres and styles.\n\nHowever, Stelaru's early career was marked by a peculiar incident. In 1937, rumors spread that he had died in a tragic accident. This \"death-hoax\" was likely orchestrated by his friends or literary rivals, seeking to generate publicity and attention for the young writer. Despite the false reports, Stelaru took advantage of the situation, using the publicity to promote his work and establish himself as a literary figure.\n\n## Albatros years\n\nIn 1938, Stelaru joined the Albatros literary circle, a group of young writers and intellectuals who sought to revolutionize Romanian literature. The Albatros movement, named after the mythical bird, aimed to create a new, modern literary style, free from traditional constraints and conventions.\n\nDuring this period, Stelaru collaborated with other notable writers, including Mihail Sebastian and Mircea Eliade. Together, they published several anthologies and literary magazines, showcasing their innovative and experimental works.\n\nStelaru's association with the Albatros circle marked a significant turning point in his career. He began to explore new themes, styles, and genres, solidifying his position as a leading figure in Romanian literature.\n\n## Antonescu-era repression and late 1940s\n\nThe outbreak of World War II and the rise of the Antonescu regime in Romania had a profound impact on Stelaru's life and work. As a prominent literary figure, he faced increasing censorship and persecution.\n\nIn 1941, Stelaru's play \"Omul care a văzut moartea\" (The Man Who Saw Death) was banned by the authorities, deemed too subversive and critical of the regime. This incident marked the beginning of a long period of repression, during which Stelaru's work was heavily censored or suppressed.\n\nDespite these challenges, Stelaru continued to write in secret, producing some of his most significant works during this period. His novel \"Cei din urmă\" (The Last Ones), written in the late 1940s, is a powerful critique of the war and its impact on Romanian society.\n\n## Censoring and obscurity\n\nIn the post-war period, Stelaru's work faced continued censorship and suppression. His association with the Albatros circle and his alleged connections to the fascist regime made him a target for communist authorities.\n\nAs a result, Stelaru's work was largely forgotten, and he fell into obscurity. He continued to write, but his works were rarely published or recognized. This period of censorship and neglect had a profound impact on Stelaru's personal and literary life.\n\n## Final return\n\nIn the 1970s, Stelaru began to re-emerge as a literary figure, thanks in part to the efforts of younger writers and critics who sought to revive his work. His novel \"Cei din urmă\" was finally published in 1975, more than two decades after its completion.\n\nThis late recognition marked a bittersweet moment in Stelaru's career. While he was finally acknowledged as a significant literary figure, he was also aware of the many years of censorship and obscurity that had denied him the recognition he deserved.\n\n# Legacy\n\nDimitrie Stelaru's legacy is complex and multifaceted, reflecting the turbulent and often contradictory nature of his life and work. As a playwright, novelist, and poet, he left behind a significant body of work that continues to be studied and appreciated today.\n\nStelaru's contribution to Romanian literature is significant, particularly in the context of the interwar period. His association with the Albatros circle and his experimental approach to literature helped shape the modern Romanian literary style.\n\nDespite the challenges and censorship he faced, Stelaru's work remains a testament to his creativity, perseverance, and commitment to his art. His legacy serves as a reminder of the power of literature to challenge, inspire, and transform society.\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is based on available sources and research, but it is not exhaustive.

She was the longest-reigning British monarch and the longest-married British monarch in history, surpassing the records set by Queen Victoria and King George III, respectively.\n\n#Early life\n\nElizabeth Alexandra Mary was born on 21 April 1926, during the reign of her paternal grandfather, King George V. She was the first child of Prince Albert, Duke of York (later King George VI), and his wife, Elizabeth, Duchess of York (later Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother). At the time of her birth, Elizabeth was third in line to the throne, after her uncle Edward, Prince of Wales, and her father.\n\nElizabeth's early life was marked by a happy and stable family environment. She was educated at home, with a focus on history, language, and music. She also developed a strong interest in horses and dogs, which would remain lifelong passions.\n\n#Heir presumptive\n\n##Second World War\n\nElizabeth's life was dramatically changed by the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939.

As the heir presumptive, Elizabeth's role in the royal family became more prominent.\n\nDuring the war, Elizabeth and her younger sister, Princess Margaret, were evacuated to Windsor Castle for their safety. Elizabeth made her first radio broadcast during the war, addressing other children who had been evacuated from cities. This broadcast marked the beginning of her public speaking career.\n\n##Marriage\n\nElizabeth met her future husband, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, in 1939.

She also became a symbol of national unity, helping to heal the wounds of war and promoting a sense of British identity.\n\n##Political reforms and crises\n\nElizabeth's reign was marked by significant political reforms, including the decolonization of Africa and Asia, and the transformation of the British Empire into the Commonwealth.\n\nThe Queen also faced numerous crises, including the Suez Crisis in 1956, the Falklands War in 1982, and the Gulf War in 1990.

The scheme aims to recruit young individuals, known as Agniveers, for a period of four years, with a provision for retaining 25% of the recruits in the regular cadre. The introduction of the scheme has been met with both praise and criticism, with various stakeholders expressing their views on its implications.\n\n#Background\n\nThe Indian Armed Forces have traditionally followed a recruitment process that involves selecting candidates for a minimum service period of 15-17 years. However, with the changing nature of warfare and the need for a more agile and technologically savvy force, the government has sought to introduce reforms in the recruitment process. The Agnipath Scheme is a result of this effort, aimed at creating a younger and more vibrant force.\n\n#Overview\n\nThe Agnipath Scheme involves recruiting individuals between the ages of 17.5 and 21 years for a period of four years. The recruits, known as Agniveers, will undergo training and serve in the armed forces for four years, after which they will be discharged. 25% of the Agniveers will be retained in the regular cadre, based on merit and performance. The scheme applies to all three branches of the armed forces - the Army, Navy, and Air Force.\n\n#Reservation and welfare benefits\n\nThe Agnipath Scheme provides for reservation and welfare benefits for the Agniveers. 10% of the vacancies will be reserved for ex-servicemen, while 10% will be reserved for EWS (Economically Weaker Sections) candidates. The Agniveers will also be entitled to a monthly stipend, as well as medical and canteen facilities. Upon discharge, the Agniveers will receive a one-time payment of ₹11.71 lakh, which includes their contribution to the Agniveer Corpus Fund.\n\n#Criticism\n\n##By political parties and activists\n\nSeveral opposition parties have criticized the Agnipath Scheme, terming it a \"disaster\" and a \"betrayal\" of the youth. They have argued that the scheme will lead to a shortage of skilled personnel in the armed forces, and that the four-year tenure is too short to provide adequate training and experience. Activists have also raised concerns about the lack of job security and pension benefits for the Agniveers.\n\n##By retired defence personnel\n\nRetired defence personnel have also expressed their concerns about the scheme, arguing that it will erode the traditional values and ethos of the armed forces. They have pointed out that the four-year tenure will not provide adequate time for the Agniveers to develop the necessary skills and experience, and that the discharge of 75% of the Agniveers after four years will create a shortage of skilled personnel.\n\n##By state governments\n\nSeveral state governments have also expressed their concerns about the scheme, arguing that it will lead to a shortage of skilled personnel in the armed forces. They have pointed out that the four-year tenure will not provide adequate time for the Agniveers to develop the necessary skills and experience, and that the discharge of 75% of the Agniveers after four years will create a shortage of skilled personnel.\n\n##Data on employment of veterans\n\nAccording to data, a significant number of veterans are already facing difficulties in finding employment after leaving the armed forces. The discharge of 75% of the Agniveers after four years is likely to exacerbate this problem, leading to a large number of young people without jobs or pension benefits.\n\n#Protests\n\nThe introduction of the Agnipath Scheme has led to widespread protests across the country, with various stakeholders expressing their opposition to the scheme.\n\n##Bharat Bandh (All India Strike)\n\nOn June 20, 2022, a Bharat Bandh (All India Strike) was called by various opposition parties and activists to protest against the Agnipath Scheme. The strike was observed in many parts of the country, with protests and demonstrations taking place in several cities.\n\n##21 June onwards\n\nFrom June 21, 2022, onwards, protests and demonstrations have continued to take place in many parts of the country, with various stakeholders expressing their opposition to the scheme. The protests have been largely peaceful, but there have been reports of violence and clashes between protesters and security forces in some areas.\n\n#Response by the Government\n\nThe government has defended the Agnipath Scheme, arguing that it will provide an opportunity for young people to serve in the armed forces and gain valuable skills and experience. The government has also pointed out that the scheme will help to create a younger and more vibrant force, and that it will provide a more agile and technologically savvy force.\n\n#Plea in the Supreme Court against the scheme\n\nA plea has been filed in the Supreme Court against the Agnipath Scheme, challenging its validity and seeking a stay on its implementation. The plea has argued that the scheme is arbitrary and discriminatory, and that it will lead to a shortage of skilled personnel in the armed forces.\n\n#First Agniveer batch (2023)\n\nThe first batch of Agniveers is expected to be recruited in 2023, with the recruitment process expected to start in the coming months.\n\n##Hyderabad\n\nThe first batch of Agniveers will undergo training at the Army's Artillery Centre in Hyderabad. The training will include basic military training, as well as specialized training in artillery and other skills.\n\n##Nashik\n\nThe second batch of Agniveers will undergo training at the Army's Infantry School in Nashik. The training will include basic military training, as well as specialized training in infantry and other skills.\n\n##Ranikhet\n\nThe third batch of Agniveers will undergo training at the Army's Kumaon Regimental Centre in Ranikhet. The training will include basic military training, as well as specialized training in mountain warfare and other skills.\n\n#Amendment in recruitment procedure\n\nThe government has announced an amendment in the recruitment procedure for the Agniveers, allowing for the recruitment of individuals up to the age of 23 years. The amendment has been made in response to the protests and demonstrations against the scheme.\n\n#See also\n\n* Indian Armed Forces\n* Recruitment in the Indian Armed Forces\n* Ex-servicemen welfare\n\n#References\n\n*Note: References have not been included in this article as per the requirements.\n\n#External links\n\n*Note: External links have not been included in this article as per the requirements.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Agnipath_Scheme\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Overview\n#Reservation and welfare benefits\n#Criticism\n##By political parties and activists\n##By retired defence personnel\n##By state governments\n##Data on employment of veterans\n#Protests\n##Bharat Bandh (All India Strike)\n##21 June onwards\n#Response by the Government\n#Plea in the Supreme Court against the scheme\n#First Agniveer batch (2023)\n##Hyderabad\n##Nashik\n##Ranikhet\n#Amendment in recruitment procedure\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The case drew widespread attention due to its shocking nature and the fact that it went undetected for several years. This article provides an overview of Letby's life, career, and the events surrounding the investigation and trial.\n\n# Early life and education\n\nLucy Letby was born in 1990 in Hereford, England. Little is known about her early life, but it is reported that she came from a normal family background. Letby pursued a career in nursing and trained at the University of Chester, graduating with a degree in nursing in 2011. She then began working as a neonatal nurse at the Countess of Chester Hospital.\n\n# Career\n\nLetby worked at the Countess of Chester Hospital for several years, starting as a junior nurse and progressing to a senior position. She was known to be a dedicated and hardworking nurse, and colleagues described her as \"caring\" and \"professional.\" However, some staff members later reported that they had concerns about Letby's behavior and the high number of incidents involving babies in her care.\n\n# Initial investigations\n\nIn 2015, hospital staff began to notice a pattern of unexpected collapses and deaths among babies in the neonatal unit. An initial investigation was launched, but it failed to identify any specific causes or suspects. The investigation was reopened in 2017 after a whistleblower came forward with concerns about Letby's behavior. This time, the investigation focused on Letby and her role in the incidents.\n\n# 2023 trial\n\nLetby was charged with the murder of seven babies and the attempted murder of six others. Her trial began in 2023 and lasted for several months. The prosecution presented a range of evidence, including handwritten notes, medical records, and testimony from colleagues and experts.\n\n## Evidence\n\n### Handwritten notes\n\nProsecutors presented Letby's handwritten notes, which appeared to show a pattern of unusual behavior and a lack of concern for the babies in her care. The notes included comments about the babies' conditions and treatment, as well as seemingly innocuous remarks about her personal life.\n\n### Medical records\n\nMedical records showed that Letby had been present during many of the incidents, and that she had administered medication and treatment to the affected babies. The records also showed that Letby had made mistakes in her treatment and had failed to follow proper procedures.\n\n## Letby's testimony\n\nLetby took the stand in her own defense, denying any wrongdoing and claiming that she was a dedicated and caring nurse. She explained that she had been under stress and pressure during the period in question, but that she had never intentionally harmed any of the babies.\n\n## Defence arguments\n\nLetby's defense team argued that the prosecution's case relied on circumstantial evidence and that there was no direct proof of Letby's guilt. They also pointed out that the hospital's neonatal unit was understaffed and under-resourced, which may have contributed to the incidents.\n\n## Verdicts and sentencing\n\nThe jury delivered guilty verdicts on all counts, and Letby was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 30 years.\n\n# Motives\n\nThe exact motives behind Letby's actions are still unclear. Prosecutors suggested that she may have been motivated by a desire for attention and sympathy, or by a twisted sense of satisfaction from being able to manipulate the babies' treatment. Letby's defense team disputed these claims, arguing that she was a dedicated nurse who had been driven by stress and pressure.\n\n# Post-conviction\n\n## Disciplinary action\n\nFollowing Letby's conviction, the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) launched an investigation into her conduct. The NMC eventually struck Letby off the nursing register, preventing her from ever practicing as a nurse again.\n\n## Appeal\n\nLetby's lawyers launched an appeal against her conviction, arguing that the prosecution's case had relied on flawed evidence and that the trial had been unfair. The appeal was rejected, with the court ruling that the conviction was safe.\n\n## Retrial\n\nThere have been calls for a retrial in the case, with some arguing that new evidence has come to light that casts doubt on Letby's guilt. However, the court has so far refused to grant a retrial.\n\n## Further investigations\n\nThe case has prompted further investigations into the safety and quality of care at the Countess of Chester Hospital. The hospital has implemented new procedures and protocols to prevent similar incidents in the future.\n\n## Thirlwall inquiry\n\nThe Thirlwall inquiry, an independent investigation into the case, was launched in 2023. The inquiry is ongoing, but its findings are expected to shed further light on the events surrounding the case.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## Calls for regulation and reform\n\nThe case has prompted calls for greater regulation and reform in the healthcare sector. Some have argued that the case highlights the need for greater scrutiny of medical staff and more robust procedures for investigating and addressing concerns.\n\n# Safety of the convictions\n\n## Concerns about the medical evidence\n\nSome experts have raised concerns about the medical evidence presented in the case, arguing that it was flawed or incomplete. Specifically, there have been questions about the role of insulin, air via nasogastric tube, and air embolism in the incidents.\n\n### Insulin\n\nSome experts have argued that the prosecution's case relied too heavily on the claim that Letby had administered insulin to the affected babies. However, others have pointed out that the evidence for this claim was circumstantial and that alternative explanations are possible.\n\n### Air via nasogastric tube\n\nThere have been concerns about the prosecution's claim that Letby had administered air via nasogastric tube to the affected babies. Some experts have argued that this claim was not supported by the evidence and that alternative explanations are possible.\n\n### Air embolism\n\nThere have been concerns about the prosecution's claim that the affected babies had died from air embolism. Some experts have argued that this claim was not supported by the evidence and that alternative explanations are possible.\n\n## Quality of the statistical evidence\n\nSome experts have raised concerns about the quality of the statistical evidence presented in the case. Specifically, there have been questions about the methods used to analyze the data and the conclusions drawn from the results.\n\n## Staff and infrastructure issues\n\nSome have argued that the case highlights the need for greater investment in staff and infrastructure in the healthcare sector. Specifically, there have been concerns about the impact of understaffing and under-resourcing on patient care.\n\n## Timeline\n\nThere have been concerns about the timeline of the case, with some arguing that the prosecution's version of events is not supported by the evidence.\n\n### X-ray timing\n\nThere have been concerns about the timing of X-rays taken during the incidents, with some arguing that the prosecution's version of events is not supported by the evidence.\n\n### Mislabelled door swipe data\n\nThere have been concerns about the accuracy of door swipe data used to track Letby's movements during the incidents. Some have argued that the data was mislabelled or incomplete.\n\n## Interpretation of handwritten notes\n\nSome experts have raised concerns about the interpretation of Letby's handwritten notes, arguing that the prosecution's version of events is not supported by the evidence.\n\n## Criticism of witnesses\n\nSome have argued that the prosecution's case relied too heavily on the testimony of certain witnesses, who may have had their own motives or biases.\n\n## Reaction to doubt\n\nSome have argued that the reaction to doubt and uncertainty in the case has been overly negative, with some accusing those who raise questions about the conviction of being \"conspiracy theorists\" or \"apologists\" for Letby.\n\n# See also", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Lucy_Letby\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and education\n#Career\n#Initial investigations\n#2023 trial\n##Evidence\n###Handwritten notes\n###Medical records\n##Letby's testimony\n##Defence arguments\n##Verdicts and sentencing\n#Motives\n#Post-conviction\n##Disciplinary action\n##Appeal\n##Retrial\n##Further investigations\n##Thirlwall inquiry\n#Reactions\n##Calls for regulation and reform\n#Safety of the convictions\n##Concerns about the medical evidence\n###Insulin\n###Air via nasogastric tube\n###Air embolism\n##Quality of the statistical evidence\n##Staff and infrastructure issues\n##Timeline\n###X-ray timing\n###Mislabelled door swipe data\n##Interpretation of handwritten notes\n##Criticism of witnesses\n##Reaction to doubt\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The event sparked widespread outrage, protests, and debates about police brutality, racism, and immigration in France.\n\n# Background\n\nIn recent years, France has been grappling with issues of police violence, racial profiling, and immigration. The country has seen a rise in anti-immigrant sentiment and xenophobic attacks, which have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and economic uncertainty. The police have also been criticized for their handling of minority communities, with allegations of systemic racism and brutality.\n\n# Victim\n\nNahel Merzouk was a 17-year-old French teenager of Algerian descent. He was a high school student and lived in Nanterre with his family. Merzouk was described by friends and family as a kind and gentle person who loved sports and music. He had no prior run-ins with the law and was not known to be involved in any gang activities.\n\n# Shooting\n\nOn June 27, 2023, Merzouk was shot and killed by a police officer in Nanterre. The incident occurred during a traffic stop, and the circumstances surrounding the shooting are disputed.\n\n## Prosecution version\n\nAccording to the prosecution, Merzouk was driving a car with two passengers when he was pulled over by police for a traffic violation. The police officers claim that Merzouk accelerated the car towards them, prompting one of the officers to open fire. The prosecution alleges that Merzouk was trying to escape and posed a threat to the officers.\n\n## Police version challenged by a video\n\nHowever, a video taken by a bystander appears to contradict the police account. The video shows the police car pulling over Merzouk's vehicle, and then an officer approaching the driver's side window. The officer is seen firing a shot, and then the car accelerates forward. The video does not show Merzouk's car accelerating towards the police before the shot was fired.\n\n## Version from the third passenger\n\nOne of the passengers in Merzouk's car, who wishes to remain anonymous, has given a different account of the events. According to the passenger, the police officer approached the car and asked Merzouk to turn off the engine. Merzouk complied, but the officer then asked him to get out of the car. As Merzouk was getting out, the officer fired a shot, striking him in the chest.\n\n# Investigation\n\nAn investigation into the shooting was launched immediately, and the police officer involved has been placed on administrative leave. The investigation is ongoing, and it is unclear whether any charges will be brought against the officer. The French government has promised a thorough and transparent investigation, but many are skeptical about the outcome.\n\n# Initial reactions\n\nThe killing of Nahel Merzouk sparked widespread outrage and protests across France. Many took to the streets to demand justice and an end to police brutality. The French government was criticized for its handling of the crisis, with many accusing them of being too slow to respond.\n\n## Polemics on immigration\n\nThe killing of Merzouk has also reignited debates about immigration and racism in France. Many have pointed out that Merzouk was a French citizen of Algerian descent and that his killing is part of a larger pattern of systemic racism and police brutality against minority communities.\n\n# Unrest\n\nThe protests and unrest sparked by Merzouk's killing have continued for several days, with many calling for greater police accountability and an end to racism. The French government has promised to listen to the concerns of the protesters and to implement reforms, but it remains to be seen whether these promises will be kept.\n\n# See also\n\n* Police brutality in France\n* Racism in France\n* Immigration to France\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a factual account of the killing of Nahel Merzouk and the surrounding events.

{"title": "Fenwick_tree", "content": "#Motivation\n#Description\n##The interrogation tree\n##The update tree\n##The search tree\n#Pseudocode\n##Construction\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Fenwick Tree\n=============\n\nA Fenwick tree, also known as a binary indexed tree, is a data structure used for efficient calculation of prefix sums and range sums in an array. It was first described by Peter Fenwick in 1994. The Fenwick tree is particularly useful in scenarios where the array is updated frequently, as it allows for fast updates and queries.\n\nMotivation\n-----------\n\nIn many applications, it is necessary to calculate prefix sums or range sums in an array. For example, in a financial application, you may want to calculate the total sales for a given time period. A naive approach would be to iterate over the array and calculate the sum, but this can be slow for large arrays. The Fenwick tree provides a more efficient solution, allowing for fast calculation of prefix sums and range sums.\n\nDescription\n-----------\n\nThe Fenwick tree is a binary tree-like data structure that stores the cumulative sums of the elements in the array. It consists of three main components: the interrogation tree, the update tree, and the search tree.\n\n### The Interrogation Tree\n\nThe interrogation tree is used to calculate prefix sums. It is a binary tree where each node represents the sum of the elements in the corresponding range. The root node represents the sum of all elements in the array, and each child node represents the sum of the elements in the corresponding half of the range.\n\n### The Update Tree\n\nThe update tree is used to update the elements in the array. When an element is updated, the corresponding node in the update tree is updated, and the changes are propagated to the child nodes. This ensures that the cumulative sums in the interrogation tree remain accurate.\n\n### The Search Tree\n\nThe search tree is used to calculate range sums. It is a binary tree where each node represents the sum of the elements in the corresponding range. The root node represents the sum of all elements in the array, and each child node represents the sum of the elements in the corresponding half of the range.\n\nPseudocode\n-----------\n\n### Construction\n\nThe Fenwick tree can be constructed using the following pseudocode:\n\n```\nfunction construct_fenwick_tree(arr):\n    n = length(arr)\n    tree = array of size n\n\n    for i from 1 to n:\n        tree[i] = arr[i]\n\n    for i from 1 to n:\n        j = i + (i & -i)\n        if j <= n:\n            tree[j] += tree[i]\n\n    return tree\n```\n\nThis pseudocode constructs the Fenwick tree by iterating over the array and updating the corresponding nodes in the tree. The `&` operator is used to calculate the next node to update.\n\nSee Also\n--------\n\n* Binary search tree\n* Segment tree\n* Range tree\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n* Fenwick, P.

The film follows the story of Evelyn Wang, a Chinese-American woman who, while being audited by the IRS, discovers that she can access parallel universes and must use this ability to prevent a catastrophic event that threatens the multiverse.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe film begins with Evelyn Wang (played by Michelle Yeoh), a middle-aged Chinese-American woman who owns a laundromat with her husband, Waymond (played by Ke Huy Quan). They are being audited by the IRS, and Evelyn is struggling to balance her business and personal life. During the audit, Evelyn is suddenly and inexplicably transported into a parallel universe, where she meets a version of herself who is a successful businesswoman.\n\nAs Evelyn navigates this new reality, she discovers that she can access multiple parallel universes, each with their own version of herself. She is contacted by a group of beings who claim to be from a universe where humanity has been destroyed by an entity known as \"Jobu Tupaki\". They inform Evelyn that Jobu Tupaki is a being who exists across the multiverse and is capable of manipulating reality.\n\nEvelyn soon discovers that she is the only one who can stop Jobu Tupaki, and that she must use her ability to access parallel universes to gather the skills and knowledge needed to defeat the entity. Along the way, she encounters various versions of herself, each with their own unique abilities and personalities.\n\nAs Evelyn navigates the multiverse, she must also confront her own personal demons and relationships. She rekindles a romance with a version of her husband, and comes to terms with her complicated relationship with her daughter, Joy (played by Stephanie Hsu).\n\n# Cast\n\n* Michelle Yeoh as Evelyn Wang\n* Ke Huy Quan as Waymond Wang\n* Jenny Slate as Big Nose\n* Harry Shum Jr. as Chad\n* Jamie Lee Curtis as Deirdre Beaubeirdre\n* Stephanie Hsu as Joy Wang / Jobu Tupaki\n* Audrey Wasilewski as Alpha RV\n\n# Production\n\n## Development\n\nThe idea for Everything Everywhere All at Once began with a conversation between Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert about the concept of the multiverse. The two directors were fascinated by the idea of exploring the infinite possibilities of the multiverse, and began brainstorming ideas for a film that could bring this concept to life.\n\nKwan and Scheinert drew inspiration from a range of sources, including science fiction novels, comic books, and martial arts films. They also drew from their own personal experiences as Asian-Americans, exploring themes of identity, culture, and belonging.\n\n## Casting\n\nCasting for the film began with Michelle Yeoh, who was the first choice for the role of Evelyn Wang. Yeoh was drawn to the project by the complexity and depth of the character, and her own experiences as a Chinese-American woman.\n\nKe Huy Quan was cast as Waymond Wang, Evelyn's husband. Quan was a child actor who rose to fame in the 1980s with roles in films such as The Goonies and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. He had largely retired from acting, but was drawn back to the profession by the script for Everything Everywhere All at Once.\n\n## Filming\n\nPrincipal photography for the film took place over 38 days in Los Angeles and San Francisco. The film was shot on a relatively low budget, with a crew of around 50 people.\n\nKwan and Scheinert used a range of techniques to bring the multiverse to life, including wire fu, special effects, and elaborate set designs. The film's action sequences were choreographed by Yuen Woo-ping, a veteran martial arts choreographer who has worked on films such as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and The Matrix.\n\n## Visual effects\n\nThe film's visual effects were handled by a team of artists and technicians from around the world. The team used a range of software and techniques to create the film's elaborate visual effects, including CGI, motion capture, and practical effects.\n\nOne of the most challenging aspects of the film's visual effects was creating the multiverse, which required the team to generate thousands of unique and detailed environments. The team also had to develop a system for tracking and animating the film's multiple versions of Evelyn, which required a high level of complexity and precision.\n\n# Themes\n\nEverything Everywhere All at Once explores a range of themes, including identity, culture, and belonging. The film delves into the complexities of the Asian-American experience, exploring the tensions between traditional and modern culture.\n\nThe film also explores the concept of the multiverse, using this as a metaphor for the infinite possibilities of human existence. The film's use of the multiverse allows it to explore themes of identity and selfhood, raising questions about the nature of reality and the self.\n\n# Music\n\nThe film's score was composed by Son Lux, a Los Angeles-based music group. The score is a highly eclectic and experimental work, incorporating elements of electronic music, rock, and classical music.\n\nThe score was recorded over several months, with the group using a range of instruments and techniques to create the film's unique sound. The score features a range of guest musicians, including Mitski, David Byrne, and André 3000.\n\n# Release\n\n## Theatrical\n\nEverything Everywhere All at Once was released in the United States on March 11, 2022. The film opened in limited release, playing in around 10 theaters in major cities such as New York and Los Angeles.\n\nThe film expanded to wider release over the next several weeks, eventually playing in over 1,000 theaters across the country. The film was released internationally in April 2022, playing in countries such as the United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada.\n\n## Home media\n\nEverything Everywhere All at Once was released on digital platforms such as iTunes and Amazon Prime Video in May 2022. The film was also released on DVD and Blu-ray in July 2022.\n\n# Reception\n\n## Box office\n\nEverything Everywhere All at Once was a commercial success, grossing over $100 million at the box office worldwide. The film performed strongly in the United States, where it grossed over $70 million.\n\nThe film's success was driven by strong word-of-mouth and positive reviews from critics. The film also benefited from its unique marketing campaign, which included a range of innovative and interactive promotional materials.\n\n## Critical response\n\nEverything Everywhere All at Once received widespread critical acclaim, with many critics praising its innovative storytelling, visuals, and performances.\n\nThe film holds a 95% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with many critics praising its originality and creativity. The film also received positive reviews from critics at major publications such as The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times, and Rolling Stone.\n\n## Legacy\n\nEverything Everywhere All at Once has been recognized as a landmark film in the science fiction genre, and has been praised for its innovative storytelling and visuals.\n\nThe film has also been recognized for its cultural significance, with many critics praising its exploration of Asian-American identity and culture. The film has been named as one of the best films of 2022 by a range of publications, including The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times, and Rolling Stone.\n\n## Accolades\n\nEverything Everywhere All at Once has received a range of awards and nominations, including several Academy Award nominations.\n\nThe film won several awards at the Independent Spirit Awards, including Best Feature, Best Director, and Best Editing.

Robert Oppenheimer\n\nJulius Robert Oppenheimer was a American theoretical physicist and director of the Manhattan Project, the secret research and development project that produced the atomic bomb during World War II. He is often referred to as the \"father of the atomic bomb.\" Oppenheimer's life was marked by a complex interplay of scientific brilliance, personal turmoil, and public controversy, which continues to fascinate and inspire people to this day.\n\n# Early life\n\n## Childhood and education\n\nOppenheimer was born on April 22, 1904, in New York City to Ella and Julius Oppenheimer, a textile importer. His family was of German-Jewish descent, and his parents were both cultured and well-educated. From an early age, Oppenheimer showed a keen interest in science and mathematics, and his parents encouraged his curiosity. He attended the Ethical Culture School in New York, where he excelled academically and developed a passion for chemistry and physics.\n\nIn 1921, Oppenheimer enrolled at Harvard University, where he studied chemistry and physics. He graduated summa cum laude in 1925 and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. During his time at Harvard, Oppenheimer developed a close relationship with his mentor, Percy Bridgman, a Nobel laureate in physics.\n\n## Studies in Europe\n\nAfter graduating from Harvard, Oppenheimer traveled to Europe to pursue advanced studies in physics. He spent a year at the University of Cambridge, where he worked under the supervision of J.J. Thomson, a prominent physicist and discoverer of the electron. In 1927, Oppenheimer moved to the University of Göttingen in Germany, where he earned his Ph.D. in physics under the supervision of Max Born.\n\nDuring his time in Europe, Oppenheimer became acquainted with many prominent physicists, including Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg, and Erwin Schrödinger. He was particularly drawn to the work of Bohr, who would later become a close friend and mentor.\n\n# Early career\n\n## Teaching\n\nIn 1929, Oppenheimer returned to the United States and began a teaching career at the University of California, Berkeley. He quickly established himself as a brilliant and charismatic instructor, and his classes became popular among students. In 1936, Oppenheimer was appointed as a professor of physics at Berkeley, a position he held until 1942.\n\n## Scientific work\n\nDuring the 1930s, Oppenheimer's research focused on theoretical physics, particularly in the areas of quantum mechanics and relativity. He made significant contributions to the development of quantum field theory and was one of the first physicists to recognize the importance of Dirac's equation.\n\nOppenheimer's work during this period was marked by a series of collaborations with other prominent physicists, including Robert Serber, Emil Konopinski, and Felix Bloch. Together, they explored topics such as cosmic rays, neutron stars, and black holes.\n\n# Private and political life\n\n## Politics\n\nOppenheimer's politics were shaped by his experiences during the Great Depression and his concern about the rise of fascism in Europe. He became increasingly involved in left-wing politics and was a member of the American Communist Party from 1936 to 1939.\n\n## Relationships and children\n\nIn 1940, Oppenheimer married Katherine \"Kitty\" Puening, a former member of the Communist Party. The couple had two children, Toni and Peter.\n\n## Mysticism\n\nOppenheimer was deeply interested in Eastern mysticism and philosophy, particularly the Bhagavad Gita and the teachings of the Buddha. He saw parallels between the concepts of quantum mechanics and the principles of Eastern thought, and he often incorporated these ideas into his lectures and writings.\n\n# Manhattan Project\n\n## Los Alamos\n\nIn 1942, Oppenheimer was appointed as the director of the Manhattan Project, a secret research and development project established by the U.S. government to develop an atomic bomb. He was chosen for the position due to his exceptional leadership skills and his ability to bring together a team of brilliant scientists.\n\nOppenheimer established the project's headquarters at Los Alamos, New Mexico, and assembled a team of over 3,000 scientists and engineers. He worked closely with Enrico Fermi, Ernest Lawrence, and Richard Feynman, among others, to develop the bomb.\n\n## Bomb design\n\nThe Manhattan Project faced numerous technical challenges, including the development of a suitable bomb design. Oppenheimer worked closely with his team to develop the \"implosion\" design, which used a spherical arrangement of explosives to compress a core of plutonium.\n\n## Trinity\n\nOn July 16, 1945, the Manhattan Project conducted the first nuclear test, known as the Trinity test, in the New Mexico desert. Oppenheimer was present at the test and witnessed the detonation of the bomb, which released an unprecedented amount of energy.\n\n# Postwar activities\n\n## Institute for Advanced Study\n\nAfter the war, Oppenheimer returned to academia and became the director of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. He played a key role in shaping the institute's research agenda and attracted many prominent scholars to the institution.\n\n## Atomic Energy Commission\n\nIn 1947, Oppenheimer was appointed as the chairman of the General Advisory Committee of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). He played a key role in shaping the AEC's policies and advocated for the development of nuclear power.\n\n## Panels and study groups\n\nOppenheimer participated in numerous panels and study groups, including the Scientific Advisory Board of the U.S. Air Force and the President's Science Advisory Committee. He was a vocal advocate for the importance of science in policy-making and the need for international cooperation on nuclear issues.\n\n## Security hearing\n\nIn 1954, Oppenheimer was subjected to a security hearing by the AEC, which was sparked by his opposition to the development of the hydrogen bomb. The hearing was highly publicized, and Oppenheimer was eventually stripped of his security clearance.\n\n# Final years\n\n## Enrico Fermi Award\n\nIn 1963, Oppenheimer was awarded the Enrico Fermi Award, the U.S. government's highest honor for contributions to nuclear energy.\n\n## Death\n\nOppenheimer died on February 18, 1967, at the age of 62, due to complications from throat cancer.\n\n# Legacy\n\nOppenheimer's legacy is complex and multifaceted. He is widely regarded as one of the most important scientists of the 20th century, and his contributions to physics and nuclear energy are still felt today.\n\n# Publications\n\nOppenheimer published numerous papers and articles throughout his career, including \"The Meaning of Secularism\" (1947) and \"Prospects in the Arts and Sciences\" (1959).\n\n# Notes\n\nNote: This article is a general overview of Oppenheimer's life and career.

This article provides an overview of the development of Finland–NATO relations, from the country's post-World War II neutrality to its current membership in the alliance.\n\n# History\n\n## Background: Finnish neutrality at the end of World War II\n\nFollowing the end of World War II, Finland found itself in a unique position, having fought against the Soviet Union in the Continuation War (1941-1944) but not being occupied by the Allied powers. As a result, Finland was not a signatory to the Treaty of Paris (1947), which imposed significant territorial and military restrictions on the country. Instead, Finland signed the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance with the Soviet Union in 1948, which established the country's post-war relationship with its eastern neighbor.\n\n## 1949–2023: Pre-membership relations\n\n### 1949–1991: Finnish neutrality during the Cold War\n\nDuring the Cold War, Finland maintained a policy of neutrality, avoiding membership in both NATO and the Warsaw Pact. This allowed the country to maintain good relations with both the Soviet Union and the Western bloc. Finland participated in various international organizations, such as the United Nations, and was a founding member of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) in 1960. However, the country's neutrality was not without its challenges, as Finland faced significant pressure from the Soviet Union to join the Warsaw Pact.\n\n### 1991–1995: Immediate aftermath of the Cold War\n\nWith the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Finland's relationship with Russia began to change. The country joined the Council of Europe in 1989 and the European Union (EU) in 1995, marking a significant shift towards integration with Western Europe. Finland also participated in the Partnership for Peace (PfP) program, launched by NATO in 1994, which aimed to promote cooperation between NATO and non-member countries.\n\n### 1995–2022: Shift from non-alignment within the European Union\n\nAs Finland deepened its integration with the EU, the country's relationship with NATO began to evolve. In 1997, Finland joined the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), which marked a significant shift away from the country's traditional neutrality. Finland also participated in various NATO-led operations, such as the Kosovo Force (KFOR) in 1999 and the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan in 2001. However, the country's membership in NATO remained a topic of debate, with some arguing that it would compromise Finland's sovereignty and neutrality.\n\n### 2022–2023: Accession process following the Russian invasion of Ukraine\n\n#### February – May 2022: Initial response to the invasion\n\nIn response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Finland's government announced a significant increase in defense spending and a review of the country's security policy. The government also announced its intention to consider NATO membership, marking a significant shift in the country's position.\n\n#### May – June 2022: Declaration of intent, application\n\nOn May 15, 2022, Finland's government announced its intention to apply for NATO membership, pending a parliamentary vote. The decision was widely supported by the Finnish public, with opinion polls showing a significant majority in favor of membership. On May 18, 2022, Finland's parliament voted in favor of applying for NATO membership, with 188 members voting in favor and 8 against.\n\n#### June 2022 – April 2023: Ratification\n\nFinland's application for NATO membership was formally submitted on July 5, 2022. The country's accession process was completed on April 4, 2023, when all 30 NATO member countries had ratified Finland's accession protocol. Finland officially became a member of NATO on April 4, 2023.\n\n## 2023–present: Finnish membership in NATO\n\nAs a member of NATO, Finland is committed to contributing to the alliance's defense and security efforts. The country is expected to participate in NATO's decision-making processes and to contribute to the alliance's military operations. Finland's membership in NATO is seen as a significant step towards strengthening the country's security and defense, particularly in light of Russia's actions in Ukraine.\n\n# Finland's foreign relations with other NATO member states\n\nFinland's membership in NATO has significant implications for the country's foreign relations with other member states. Finland is expected to deepen its cooperation with other NATO members, particularly in the areas of defense and security. The country is also expected to participate in NATO's various initiatives and programs, such as the alliance's counter-terrorism efforts and its cooperation with partner countries.\n\n# See also\n\n* Finland–Russia relations\n* Finland–European Union relations\n* NATO enlargement\n* Partnership for Peace\n\n# References\n\n# Bibliography\n\n# External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Finland–NATO_relations\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Background: Finnish neutrality at the end of World War II\n##1949–2023: Pre-membership relations\n###1949–1991: Finnish neutrality during the Cold War\n###1991–1995: Immediate aftermath of the Cold War\n###1995–2022: Shift from non-alignment within the European Union\n###2022–2023: Accession process following the Russian invasion of Ukraine\n####February – May 2022: Initial response to the invasion\n####May – June 2022: Declaration of intent, application\n####June 2022 – April 2023: Ratification\n##2023–present: Finnish membership in NATO\n#Finland's foreign relations with other NATO member states\n#See also\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He is remembered for his significant contributions to the cultural, artistic, and medical developments of the kingdom. His reign is often referred to as the \"Golden Age\" of Manipur.\n\nRise to power\n-------------\n\nNongdā Lāiren Pākhangbā ascended to the throne in 1763 after the death of his father, King Chitsai. At the time, the kingdom was facing numerous challenges, including internal conflicts and external threats from neighboring kingdoms. However, Pākhangbā quickly established himself as a capable and strong leader, earning the respect and loyalty of his people.\n\nFamily\n-------\n\nPākhangbā was born into a royal family and was the eldest son of King Chitsai and Queen Nongdā. He had several siblings, including brothers and sisters who played important roles in the kingdom. Pākhangbā married a princess from a neighboring kingdom, and they had several children together. His family life was marked by tragedy, however, when his wife and several of his children died in a smallpox epidemic.\n\nLaw and order\n-------------\n\nPākhangbā is credited with establishing a fair and just system of law and order in the kingdom. He created a new code of laws, which emphasized the importance of honesty, integrity, and compassion. He also established a network of courts and judges to ensure that justice was served throughout the kingdom. Under his leadership, crime rates decreased, and the kingdom became a safer and more secure place to live.\n\nArtistic and cultural developments\n---------------------------------\n\nPākhangbā was a patron of the arts and encouraged the development of music, dance, and theater in the kingdom. He established a royal academy of music and dance, where young artists could come to learn and train. He also encouraged the development of traditional Manipuri crafts, such as pottery and weaving. Under his patronage, the kingdom experienced a cultural renaissance, and the arts flourished.\n\nInstitutions of medical care\n---------------------------\n\nPākhangbā recognized the importance of healthcare in the kingdom and established several institutions of medical care.

The operation was carried out by the United States, marking a significant blow to the terrorist group.\n\n#Background\n\nAyman al-Zawahiri was an Egyptian physician and Islamic theologian who became a key figure in the global jihadist movement. He was born in 1951 in Cairo, Egypt, and studied medicine at Cairo University. Al-Zawahiri's radicalization began in the 1970s, and he eventually joined the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, a militant group that aimed to overthrow the Egyptian government. In the 1980s, he became associated with Osama bin Laden, the founder of al-Qaeda, and the two formed a close alliance.\n\nFollowing the 9/11 attacks in 2001, al-Zawahiri became a key target for the United States and its allies. He was believed to be hiding in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and was the subject of numerous manhunts and drone strikes. In 2011, bin Laden was killed in a raid by US Navy SEALs in Abbottabad, Pakistan, and al-Zawahiri took over as the leader of al-Qaeda.\n\nDespite his new role, al-Zawahiri's leadership was marked by a decline in al-Qaeda's influence and a series of setbacks. The group's affiliates in Iraq and Syria were defeated, and many of its top leaders were killed or captured. However, al-Zawahiri remained a powerful symbol of the global jihadist movement, and his death was seen as a significant blow to al-Qaeda's morale and cohesion.\n\n#Preparation\n\nThe operation to kill Ayman al-Zawahiri was reportedly months in the making. US intelligence agencies had been tracking al-Zawahiri's movements, and had identified a safe house in Kabul where he was believed to be hiding. The CIA and other US agencies worked closely with Afghan and Pakistani intelligence services to gather intelligence and plan the operation.\n\nThe US military also played a key role in the preparation, with US Air Force and US Navy assets being deployed to the region. The operation was reportedly authorized by President Joe Biden, who was briefed regularly on the plans.\n\n#Operation\n\nOn July 31, 2022, at approximately 6:00 am local time, a US drone strike hit the safe house in Kabul where al-Zawahiri was believed to be hiding. The strike was carried out by a US MQ-9 Reaper drone, which fired two Hellfire missiles at the target. Al-Zawahiri was killed in the strike, along with one other person, believed to be a bodyguard.\n\nThe operation was reportedly carried out without the knowledge or consent of the Taliban, which had taken control of Afghanistan in August 2021. The Taliban had previously promised to prevent al-Qaeda from operating in the country, but the killing of al-Zawahiri raised questions about the group's ability to enforce this promise.\n\n#Aftermath\n\n##Al-Qaeda response\n\nAl-Qaeda released a statement confirming al-Zawahiri's death, and vowed to continue its fight against the United States and its allies. The group's new leader, Saif al-Adel, was reportedly appointed shortly after al-Zawahiri's death.\n\n##U.S. politicians\n\nUS President Joe Biden announced al-Zawahiri's death in a televised address, saying that the operation was a \"significant blow\" to al-Qaeda. Other US politicians, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, praised the operation and hailed al-Zawahiri's death as a major victory.\n\n##Taliban\n\nThe Taliban released a statement condemning the US drone strike, saying that it was a \"violation of Afghanistan's sovereignty\". The group also promised to investigate the incident and to take action against any individuals who had helped the US.\n\n##International governments\n\nThe killing of al-Zawahiri was widely condemned by governments around the world.

{"title": "Illegal_operation_(euphemism)", "content": "#History\n##Background\n##\"The thing that had no name\"\n##Abortion euphemism elsewhere in print\n#Law\n#Art\n##Film\n##Television\n##Sculpture\n##Fiction\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Illegal Operation (Euphemism)\n\nAn illegal operation refers to a euphemism used to describe an abortion, particularly in the mid-20th century. This term was employed to avoid direct mention of the procedure, which was often stigmatized and subject to varying laws and regulations. The use of this euphemism provides insight into the societal attitudes and restrictions surrounding reproductive rights during that era.\n\n**History**\n\n### Background\n\nIn many countries, abortion has been a contentious issue for centuries, with laws and social norms often prohibiting or restricting access to the procedure. As a result, individuals seeking abortions had to rely on clandestine and often unsafe methods, which led to significant health risks and mortality rates. The use of euphemisms like \"illegal operation\" emerged as a way to discuss abortions without explicitly mentioning the procedure, thereby avoiding potential repercussions.\n\n### \"The thing that had no name\"\n\nThe term \"illegal operation\" became a commonly used euphemism for abortion in the mid-20th century, particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom. This phrase was employed in various contexts, including literature, journalism, and everyday conversation. By using this term, individuals could refer to an abortion without directly stating it, thus avoiding potential social or professional repercussions.\n\n### Abortion euphemism elsewhere in print\n\nSimilar euphemisms were used in other countries and languages. For example, in France, the term \"avortement clandestin\" (clandestine abortion) was used, while in Germany, \"Schwangerschaftsabbruch\" (termination of pregnancy) was employed. These euphemisms reflect the varying social and cultural attitudes towards abortion in different countries and regions.\n\n**Law**\n\nThe use of euphemisms like \"illegal operation\" was often linked to the legal status of abortion in different countries. In jurisdictions where abortion was prohibited or heavily restricted, the use of such euphemisms became more widespread. For instance, in the United States, prior to the landmark Roe v. Wade decision in 1973, abortion was largely illegal, and the term \"illegal operation\" was commonly used to describe the procedure.\n\nIn contrast, countries with more permissive abortion laws, such as Sweden and Denmark, saw less use of euphemisms like \"illegal operation.\" Instead, terms like \"abort\" or \"termination of pregnancy\" were used more directly.\n\n**Art**\n\nThe use of euphemisms like \"illegal operation\" has also been explored in various art forms, including film, television, sculpture, and fiction.\n\n### Film\n\nIn cinema, films like \"Rebecca\" (1940) and \"The Yellow Wallpaper\" (1977) feature characters who undergo abortions, but the procedure is often referred to indirectly, using euphemisms like \"illegal operation.\" These films reflect the societal attitudes towards abortion at the time, where direct discussion of the procedure was often stigmatized.\n\n### Television\n\nTelevision shows like \"All in the Family\" (1971-1979) and \"Maude\" (1972-1978) tackled the topic of abortion, but often used euphemisms like \"illegal operation\" to avoid direct reference. These shows demonstrate how television programming reflected and influenced societal attitudes towards abortion during the 1970s.\n\n### Sculpture\n\nIn sculpture, artists like Magdalena Abakanowicz and Louise Bourgeois have created works that address reproductive rights and abortion. Their use of indirect language and symbolism reflects the continued need for euphemisms like \"illegal operation\" in discussing abortion.\n\n### Fiction\n\nIn literature, authors like Simone de Beauvoir, Margaret Atwood, and Joyce Carol Oates have written about abortion, often using euphemisms like \"illegal operation\" to convey the complexity and nuance of the issue. These works demonstrate how fiction can provide a platform for exploring the human experiences surrounding abortion.\n\nIn conclusion, the use of euphemisms like \"illegal operation\" for abortion reflects the complex and often contentious nature of reproductive rights. By examining the history and cultural context of these euphemisms, we can gain a deeper understanding of the social attitudes and laws that have shaped the discussion of abortion over time.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Illegal_operation_(euphemism)\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Background\n##\"The thing that had no name\"\n##Abortion euphemism elsewhere in print\n#Law\n#Art\n##Film\n##Television\n##Sculpture\n##Fiction\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The goal of mitigation is to stabilize the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and slow down the rate of global warming. Climate change mitigation is critical for addressing the climate crisis, as it can help avoid the most catastrophic consequences of climate change, such as sea-level rise, extreme weather events, and disruptions to ecosystems and human societies.\n\n# Definitions and scope\n\nClimate change mitigation involves a range of strategies and actions aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing carbon sinks. The scope of mitigation efforts encompasses various sectors, including energy, transportation, industry, agriculture, and waste management. Mitigation actions can be implemented at different levels, from local to national and international.\n\n## Relationship with solar radiation modification (SRM)\n\nSolar radiation modification (SRM) refers to the intentional alteration of the Earth's energy balance through the injection of aerosols or other substances into the stratosphere to reflect sunlight back into space. While SRM is sometimes discussed as a potential complement to mitigation efforts, it is not a substitute for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. SRM has significant uncertainties and potential risks, and its development and deployment should be subject to rigorous scientific evaluation and international governance.\n\n# Emission trends and pledges\n\n## Needed emissions cuts\n\nTo limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that global greenhouse gas emissions need to be reduced by 45% by 2030 and reach net-zero by 2050. However, current country pledges under the Paris Agreement are insufficient to meet this goal.\n\n## Pledges\n\nAs of 2022, countries have submitted Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement, outlining their greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. While some countries have set ambitious targets, the aggregate level of ambition is still insufficient to meet the 1.5°C goal. The Paris Agreement calls for countries to increase their ambition and submit new NDCs every five years.\n\n# Low-carbon energy\n\n## Solar and wind energy\n\nSolar and wind energy are the fastest-growing sources of renewable energy, driven by declining costs and improving technology. Solar energy can be generated through photovoltaic (PV) panels or concentrated solar power (CSP) systems, while wind energy is generated through wind turbines. Both solar and wind energy have the potential to play a significant role in the global energy mix.\n\n## Other renewables\n\nOther renewable energy sources, such as hydroelectric power, geothermal energy, and biomass, can also contribute to a low-carbon energy mix. Hydroelectric power is a well-established source of renewable energy, while geothermal energy has significant potential in regions with suitable geology. Biomass can be produced from organic matter, such as wood waste or agricultural residues, and can be used for heat, electricity, or transportation fuels.\n\n## Integrating variable renewable energy\n\nThe integration of variable renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, into the grid requires advanced technologies and infrastructure, including energy storage systems, smart grids, and demand response systems. Energy storage systems, such as batteries, can help stabilize the grid and ensure a reliable energy supply.\n\n## Nuclear power\n\nNuclear power can play a role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, particularly in countries with existing nuclear infrastructure. However, the development of new nuclear power plants is often hindered by high costs, safety concerns, and waste disposal issues.\n\n## Replacing coal with natural gas\n\nReplacing coal with natural gas for electricity generation can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, particularly in countries with significant coal-fired power plants. However, natural gas is still a fossil fuel and contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, and its development should be subject to strict environmental regulations.\n\n# Demand reduction\n\n## Energy conservation and efficiency\n\nEnergy conservation and efficiency measures can reduce energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions. Building insulation, efficient lighting and appliances, and smart grids can all contribute to energy conservation and efficiency.\n\n## Lifestyle changes\n\nLifestyle changes, such as reducing meat consumption, using public transportation, and increasing energy-efficient behaviors, can also contribute to greenhouse gas emission reductions.\n\n## Dietary change\n\nDietary changes, such as reducing meat consumption or adopting a plant-based diet, can reduce greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture and land use.\n\n## Family size\n\nReducing family size can also contribute to greenhouse gas emission reductions, particularly in countries with high population growth rates.\n\n# Preserving and enhancing carbon sinks\n\n## Forests\n\nForests are critical carbon sinks, and their preservation and expansion are essential for mitigating climate change.\n\n### Conservation\n\nForest conservation efforts, such as protected areas and sustainable forest management, can help maintain forest carbon sinks.\n\n### Afforestation and reforestation\n\nAfforestation and reforestation efforts, such as planting new trees or restoring degraded forests, can expand forest carbon sinks.\n\n## Soils\n\nSoil conservation and restoration efforts, such as agroforestry and permaculture, can help maintain soil carbon sinks.\n\n## Wetlands\n\nWetlands, such as mangroves and peatlands, are important carbon sinks and should be protected and restored.\n\n## Deep ocean\n\nThe deep ocean is a significant carbon sink, and its preservation and protection are critical for mitigating climate change.\n\n## Enhanced weathering\n\nEnhanced weathering, the process of accelerating the natural weathering of rocks to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, is a potential carbon sink enhancement strategy.\n\n# Other methods to capture and store CO2\n\n## Carbon capture and storage (CCS)\n\nCCS involves the capture of carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and industrial processes, followed by storage in geological formations. CCS has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel-based power generation and industrial processes.\n\n## Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS)\n\nBECCS involves the production of bioenergy from biomass, followed by capture and storage of the carbon dioxide emissions. BECCS has the potential to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and produce net-negative emissions.\n\n# Mitigation by sector\n\n## Buildings\n\nBuilding energy efficiency measures, such as insulation and efficient appliances, can reduce energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n## Urban planning\n\nUrban planning strategies, such as green infrastructure and compact urban design, can reduce energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n## Transport\n\nTransportation sector mitigation efforts, such as electric vehicles and public transportation, can reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n### Shipping\n\nShipping sector mitigation efforts, such as fuel efficiency and alternative fuels, can reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n### Air transport\n\nAir transport sector mitigation efforts, such as fuel efficiency and alternative fuels, can reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n## Agriculture, forestry and land use\n\nAgriculture, forestry, and land use sector mitigation efforts, such as sustainable agriculture and reforestation, can reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n## Industry\n\nIndustrial sector mitigation efforts, such as energy efficiency and fuel switching, can reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n# Co-benefits\n\n## Employment and economic development\n\nClimate change mitigation efforts can create jobs and stimulate economic development, particularly in the renewable energy sector.\n\n## Energy security\n\nClimate change mitigation efforts can improve energy security by reducing dependence on fossil fuels and enhancing energy self-sufficiency.\n\n## Health and well-being\n\nClimate change mitigation efforts can improve health and well-being by reducing air pollution and promoting sustainable development.\n\n## Climate change adaptation\n\nClimate change mitigation efforts can also contribute to climate change adaptation by reducing the severity of climate-related impacts.\n\n# Negative side effects\n\nClimate change mitigation efforts can also have negative side effects, such as job displacement in the fossil fuel industry and land-use conflicts associated with renewable energy development. These side effects should be carefully managed through effective policies and regulations.\n\n# Costs and funding\n\n## Avoided costs of climate change effects\n\nClimate change mitigation efforts can avoid significant costs associated with climate-related impacts, such as damage to infrastructure and loss of productivity.\n\n## Distributing emissions abatement costs\n\nThe distribution of emissions abatement costs among countries and sectors is a critical issue in climate change mitigation efforts. Effective policies and international agreements can help distribute these costs fairly.\n\n## Funding\n\nClimate change mitigation efforts require significant funding, particularly for developing countries. International funding mechanisms, such as the Green Climate Fund, can help mobilize funding for climate change mitigation efforts.\n\n# Policies\n\n## National policies\n\nNational policies, such as carbon pricing and renewable portfolio standards, can drive climate change mitigation efforts.\n\n### Carbon pricing\n\nCarbon pricing, such as carbon taxes and cap-and-trade systems, can provide a financial incentive for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n## International agreements\n\nInternational agreements, such as the Paris Agreement, can provide a framework for climate change mitigation efforts and facilitate international cooperation.\n\n### Paris Agreement\n\nThe Paris Agreement sets a global framework for climate change mitigation efforts, including Nationally Determined Contributions and a global stocktake process.\n\n# History\n\nThe history of climate change mitigation efforts dates back to the 1980s, with the establishment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

The grade of a climb is a subjective assessment, taking into account various factors such as the physical and technical demands, exposure, and the level of risk involved. Over time, different grading systems have evolved to cater to various disciplines within climbing, including free climbing, bouldering, aid climbing, ice and mixed climbing, and mountaineering.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\nThe concept of grading climbs dates back to the late 19th century, when alpinists in the European Alps began using a simple system of gradations to describe the difficulty of routes. As climbing evolved, so did the grading systems, with various regions and communities developing their own methods for measuring difficulty. Today, there are numerous grading systems in use worldwide, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.\n\nFree Climbing\n-------------\n\nFree climbing involves ascending a rock wall using only one's hands, feet, and other body parts, without any mechanical aid. Grading systems for free climbing have become increasingly sophisticated, with various systems emerging to cater to different regions and climbing styles.\n\n### French Numerical Grade\n\nThe French numerical grade system is one of the most widely used grading systems in the world. It consists of a numerical scale, ranging from 1 (easy) to 9 (extremely difficult). The system is further subdivided into sub-grades, denoted by letters (e.g., 6a, 6b, 6c). The French system is known for its objectivity and is widely used in international competitions.\n\n### American YDS Grade\n\nThe Yosemite Decimal System (YDS) is a grading system developed in the United States, primarily used in North America. The system consists of five classes, ranging from Class 1 (easy walking) to Class 5 (technical climbing). Within Class 5, there are sub-grades, denoted by numbers (e.g., 5.0, 5.1, 5.2). The YDS system is known for its simplicity and is widely used in the United States.\n\n### UIAA Scale\n\nThe Union of International Alpine Associations (UIAA) scale is a grading system used in Europe and other parts of the world. The system consists of a Roman numeral scale, ranging from I (easy) to X (extremely difficult). The UIAA system is known for its objectivity and is widely used in international competitions.\n\n### British E-Grade\n\nThe British E-grade system is a grading system used in the United Kingdom. The system consists of a letter scale, ranging from E1 (easy) to E9 (extremely difficult). The British system is known for its subjectivity and is widely used in the UK.\n\n### Other Notable Systems\n\nOther notable grading systems for free climbing include the Australian Ewbank system, the German UIAA system, and the South African grading system.\n\nBouldering\n------------\n\nBouldering involves ascending short, lower-level rock formations, typically without the use of ropes or harnesses. Grading systems for bouldering have evolved to cater to the unique demands of this discipline.\n\n### Comparison with Free Climbing\n\nBouldering grades are generally considered more subjective than free climbing grades, as the physical and technical demands of bouldering are often more intense and varied. Bouldering grades also tend to be more localized, with different regions and communities developing their own systems.\n\n### Font Grade\n\nThe Font grade system is a grading system used in Europe, primarily in France and the UK. The system consists of a numerical scale, ranging from 1 (easy) to 8 (extremely difficult). The Font system is known for its objectivity and is widely used in international competitions.\n\n### V-Grade\n\nThe V-grade system is a grading system used in North America, primarily in the United States. The system consists of a letter scale, ranging from V0 (easy) to V16 (extremely difficult). The V-grade system is known for its simplicity and is widely used in the US.\n\n### Other Notable Systems\n\nOther notable grading systems for bouldering include the Australian V-grade system, the British font grade system, and the Japanese bouldering grade system.\n\nAid Climbing\n-------------\n\nAid climbing involves ascending a rock wall using mechanical aid, such as ladders, hooks, and cams. Grading systems for aid climbing have evolved to cater to the unique demands of this discipline.\n\n### Instability of Aid Grades\n\nAid grades are generally considered more unstable than free climbing grades, as the physical and technical demands of aid climbing are often more variable and dependent on the quality of the aid.\n\n### Original A-Grade\n\nThe original A-grade system is a grading system developed in the United States, primarily used in North America. The system consists of a letter scale, ranging from A0 (easy) to A5 (extremely difficult). The original A-grade system is known for its simplicity and is widely used in the US.\n\n### New Wave A-Grade\n\nThe new wave A-grade system is a grading system developed in the 1980s, primarily used in North America. The system consists of a letter scale, ranging from A0 (easy) to A5 (extremely difficult). The new wave A-grade system is known for its objectivity and is widely used in international competitions.\n\n### Clean C-Grade\n\nThe clean C-grade system is a grading system developed in North America, primarily used in the United States. The system consists of a letter scale, ranging from C0 (easy) to C5 (extremely difficult). The clean C-grade system is known for its simplicity and is widely used in the US.\n\nIce and Mixed Climbing\n----------------------\n\nIce and mixed climbing involve ascending ice formations and rock walls using specialized equipment and techniques. Grading systems for ice and mixed climbing have evolved to cater to the unique demands of these disciplines.\n\n### WI-Grade\n\nThe WI-grade system is a grading system used for ice climbing, primarily in North America.

He is best known for his work as the curator of the Australian Museum in Sydney, where he played a significant role in the development of the institution and its collections. Krefft was a strong supporter of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution and was involved in several controversies related to the subject.\n\n# Family\n\nGerard Krefft was born in 1830 in Bonn, Germany, to a family of modest means. His father was a merchant, and the family moved to Mannheim when Krefft was a young boy. He was the eldest of several children, and his family encouraged his interest in natural history from an early age.\n\n## Education\n\nKrefft received his early education in Mannheim, where he developed a passion for natural history and the sciences. He later attended the University of Bonn, where he studied zoology, botany, and geology. Krefft's education was influenced by the work of prominent German naturalists, including Alexander von Humboldt and Johannes Müller.\n\n## Marriage\n\nIn 1857, Krefft married a woman named Annie, and the couple had several children together. Little is known about Krefft's personal life, but it is clear that his family was supportive of his career as a naturalist and museum curator.\n\n## German heritage\n\nKrefft's German heritage played a significant role in his life and career. He maintained strong ties to his homeland and was influenced by the work of German naturalists and scientists. Krefft's language skills and cultural background also facilitated his communication with German-speaking scientists and collectors.\n\n# \"Natural history\"\n\nKrefft's work as a naturalist and museum curator was influenced by the concept of \"natural history,\" which emphasized the study of the natural world through observation and collection. Krefft believed that the study of natural history was essential for understanding the world and its many wonders.\n\n## \"Darwinian doctrine\" and the consequent \"Darwinian controversy\"\n\nIn the mid-19th century, Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection sparked a significant controversy among scientists and the general public. Krefft was a strong supporter of Darwin's theory and was involved in several debates and controversies related to the subject.\n\n## Evolution\n\nKrefft believed that evolution was a fundamental principle of the natural world and that it was essential for understanding the diversity of life on Earth. He was fascinated by the concept of adaptation and the ways in which organisms evolved over time to occupy specific ecological niches.\n\n## Natural selection\n\nKrefft saw natural selection as a key mechanism driving the process of evolution. He believed that the struggle for existence and the survival of the fittest were fundamental principles that governed the natural world.\n\n## Ellegård's five \"positions\" held by scientists in the Darwinian controversy\n\nAlvar Ellegård, a Swedish historian of science, identified five positions held by scientists during the Darwinian controversy: (1) complete rejection of Darwin's theory, (2) acceptance of evolution but rejection of natural selection, (3) acceptance of natural selection but rejection of evolution, (4) acceptance of both evolution and natural selection, and (5) a neutral or undecided position. Krefft fell into the fourth category, accepting both evolution and natural selection.\n\n# Artist\n\nKrefft was a skilled artist and illustrator, and his drawings and paintings of natural history specimens were highly regarded by his contemporaries. He used his artistic skills to document and illustrate the specimens in his care, and his work was published in several scientific journals and books.\n\n# Victoria (1852 – 1858)\n\nIn 1852, Krefft traveled to Victoria, Australia, where he worked as a naturalist and collector. He was employed by the Museum of Natural History in Melbourne, where he worked under the direction of Professor Frederick McCoy.\n\n## Melbourne\n\nKrefft's time in Melbourne was marked by significant scientific and cultural developments. The city was a hub of activity, with many scientists and intellectuals gathered to discuss and debate the latest ideas and discoveries.\n\n## Blandowski, the Museum of Natural History, and Professor McCoy\n\nKrefft worked closely with Wilhelm Blandowski, a German-born naturalist and explorer, and Professor Frederick McCoy, the director of the Museum of Natural History. The three men shared a passion for natural history and worked together to build the museum's collections and promote scientific knowledge in the region.\n\n# Germany\n\nIn 1858, Krefft returned to Germany, where he worked as a naturalist and museum curator. He was employed by the Dresden Museum, where he was responsible for the care and management of the institution's natural history collections.\n\n# Natural historian, museum curator and administrator\n\nKrefft's work as a natural historian, museum curator, and administrator was marked by a commitment to scientific excellence and a passion for promoting public understanding of natural history.\n\n## Darwinism\n\nKrefft was a strong supporter of Darwin's theory of evolution and was involved in several debates and controversies related to the subject.\n\n## \"The New Museum Idea\"\n\nKrefft believed in the importance of public museums and the role they played in promoting scientific knowledge and understanding. He advocated for a new approach to museum design and management, which emphasized the importance of education and public engagement.\n\n## Cabinets of curiosities\n\nKrefft was critical of the traditional approach to museum design, which emphasized the display of rare and unusual specimens in cabinets of curiosities. He believed that this approach was outdated and that museums should focus on promoting scientific knowledge and understanding.\n\n## Public museums\n\nKrefft believed that public museums were essential for promoting scientific knowledge and understanding. He advocated for the establishment of public museums that were accessible to everyone and that provided educational programs and exhibitions.\n\n## The \"new museum\"\n\nKrefft's vision for the \"new museum\" emphasized the importance of education and public engagement. He believed that museums should be designed to promote scientific knowledge and understanding, and that they should provide a range of educational programs and exhibitions.\n\n## Krefft's curatorial rationale\n\nKrefft's approach to museum curation was guided by a commitment to scientific excellence and a passion for promoting public understanding of natural history. He believed that museums should be designed to promote scientific knowledge and understanding, and that they should provide a range of educational programs and exhibitions.\n\n## Lack of funding\n\nDespite his vision for the \"new museum,\" Krefft faced significant challenges in securing funding for his projects. He was often forced to rely on private donations and government grants, which were unpredictable and unreliable.\n\n# Photography\n\nKrefft was an early adopter of photography, and he used the medium to document and illustrate natural history specimens. He believed that photography was a powerful tool for promoting scientific knowledge and understanding.\n\n# Queensland lungfish (Neoceratodus forsteri)\n\nIn 1868, Krefft discovered a new species of lungfish in Queensland, Australia. The species, which was later named Neoceratodus forsteri, was a significant discovery that shed new light on the evolution of air-breathing fish.\n\n## Louis Agassiz and the Chimaera\n\nKrefft's discovery of the Queensland lungfish was influenced by the work of Louis Agassiz, a Swiss-American naturalist who had written about the Chimaera, a mythical creature that was said to have the head of a lion, the body of a goat, and the tail of a serpent.\n\n## Gerard Krefft, William Forster, and the cartilaginous Burnett Salmon or barramunda\n\nKrefft's discovery of the Queensland lungfish was also influenced by his work with William Forster, an Australian naturalist who had written about the cartilaginous Burnett Salmon or barramunda.\n\n## January 1870\n\nIn January 1870, Krefft published a paper on the Queensland lungfish, which was a significant contribution to the field of ichthyology.\n\n# Krefft's \"Natural History\" articles in The Sydney Mail\n\nKrefft wrote a series of articles on natural history for The Sydney Mail, a newspaper that was published in Sydney, Australia.\n\n## George B. Mason and The Australian Home Companion and Band of Hope Journal\n\nKrefft's articles were influenced by the work of George B.

The test marked the first high-altitude flight of the Starship spacecraft and aimed to demonstrate its capabilities and gather valuable data for future development.\n\n# Background\n\n## Starship\n\nThe Starship spacecraft is a next-generation reusable spacecraft designed by SpaceX to take both people and cargo to the Moon, Mars, and other destinations in the solar system. The spacecraft is powered by six Raptor engines and is designed to be capable of carrying up to 100 passengers. The Starship spacecraft is also designed to be reusable, with the ability to land vertically and take off again, similar to the company's Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets.\n\n## Development\n\nDevelopment of the Starship spacecraft began in 2019, with the company announcing its plans to build a reusable spacecraft capable of taking both people and cargo to the Moon and Mars. The company has since made significant progress in the development of the spacecraft, with the construction of multiple prototypes and the testing of its Raptor engines.\n\n## Opinions before launch\n\nBefore the launch of the Starship Flight Test 1, there were mixed opinions about the test. Some experts expressed concerns about the safety of the test, citing the risks associated with testing a new spacecraft. Others expressed excitement about the potential of the Starship spacecraft and the progress that SpaceX had made in its development.\n\n## Test objectives\n\nThe primary objectives of the Starship Flight Test 1 were to test the spacecraft's ascent and descent capabilities, as well as its ability to land vertically. The test also aimed to gather data on the spacecraft's performance and identify areas for improvement.\n\n# Launch\n\n## Flight profile\n\nThe flight profile for the Starship Flight Test 1 involved the spacecraft lifting off from the launch site and ascending to an altitude of approximately 26,000 feet (8,000 meters). The spacecraft then performed a series of maneuvers, including a pitch and yaw, before beginning its descent. The spacecraft landed vertically, using its Raptor engines to slow its descent.\n\n## Flight timeline\n\nThe Starship Flight Test 1 was originally scheduled to launch on April 17, 2023. However, due to technical issues, the launch was scrubbed and rescheduled for April 20, 2023.\n\n## April 17 2023 attempt\n\nOn April 17, 2023, SpaceX attempted to launch the Starship Flight Test 1. However, due to technical issues, the launch was scrubbed. The company cited issues with the spacecraft's Raptor engines as the reason for the delay.\n\n## April 20, 2023, 2nd attempt\n\nOn April 20, 2023, SpaceX successfully launched the Starship Flight Test 1. The spacecraft lifted off from the launch site at 2:00 PM CDT (1900 UTC) and ascended to an altitude of approximately 26,000 feet (8,000 meters). The spacecraft performed a series of maneuvers, including a pitch and yaw, before beginning its descent. The spacecraft landed vertically, using its Raptor engines to slow its descent.\n\n# Aftermath\n\n## Technical assessments\n\nFollowing the launch, SpaceX conducted a technical assessment of the Starship Flight Test 1. The company reported that the test was successful, with the spacecraft performing as expected. The company also identified areas for improvement, including the need to refine the spacecraft's landing technology.\n\n## Launch site\n\nThe Starship Flight Test 1 was launched from SpaceX's launch site in Boca Chica, Texas. The launch site is a remote area located near the US-Mexico border and has been the site of several previous SpaceX launches.\n\n## Effects on environment\n\nThe Starship Flight Test 1 had minimal effects on the environment. The launch site is located in a remote area, and the spacecraft's Raptor engines are designed to be environmentally friendly.\n\n## FAA investigation\n\nFollowing the launch, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) conducted an investigation into the Starship Flight Test 1. The FAA reported that the test was successful, with no major issues or concerns.\n\n# See also\n\n* SpaceX\n* Starship (spacecraft)\n* Reusable launch system\n* Falcon 9\n* Falcon Heavy\n\n# Notes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Starship_flight_test_1\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Starship\n##Development\n##Opinions before launch\n##Test objectives\n#Launch\n##Flight profile\n##Flight timeline\n##April 17 2023 attempt\n##April 20, 2023, 2nd attempt\n#Aftermath\n##Technical assessments\n##Launch site\n##Effects on environment\n##FAA investigation\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The election was the first to be held since the 2019–21 protests and the COVID-19 pandemic, which had a significant impact on the country. The election was also the first to be held after the Beirut explosion, which occurred in August 2020.\n\n#Background\n\nThe 2022 Lebanese general election took place against the backdrop of a severe economic crisis, a pandemic, and a massive explosion that devastated the capital city.\n\n##2019–21 protests\n\nThe 2019–21 protests in Lebanon began in October 2019 and lasted for several months, with protesters demanding the resignation of the government and the establishment of a new political system. The protests were sparked by a proposed tax on WhatsApp calls, but quickly turned into a broader movement calling for an end to corruption, sectarianism, and the current political system. The protests led to the resignation of Prime Minister Saad Hariri, but the government that replaced him was unable to address the country's economic crisis.\n\n##Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nLebanon was severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which had a significant impact on the country's economy. The pandemic led to a sharp decline in tourism, a crucial sector for the Lebanese economy, and a significant increase in unemployment. The government's response to the pandemic was widely criticized, with many accusing the authorities of being slow to respond to the crisis.\n\n##Beirut explosion\n\nOn August 4, 2020, a massive explosion occurred at the Port of Beirut, killing over 200 people and injuring thousands more. The explosion was caused by the ignition of a shipment of ammonium nitrate that had been stored at the port for several years. The blast was one of the largest non-nuclear explosions in history, and it caused widespread destruction in the city. The government's response to the disaster was widely criticized, with many accusing the authorities of being slow to respond to the crisis and of failing to provide adequate support to those affected.\n\n#Electorate\n\nThe 2022 Lebanese general election was held using a proportional representation system, with voters electing members of parliament to represent their district.\n\n##Electoral system\n\nLebanon uses a proportional representation system, with voters electing members of parliament to represent their district.

The number of members of parliament elected in each district is based on the district's population.\n\n##Registered voters\n\nThere were over 3.9 million registered voters in the 2022 Lebanese general election, with voters able to cast their ballots in person or by proxy. Voters were required to be at least 21 years old and to be Lebanese citizens.\n\n#Lebanese living abroad\n\nLebanese citizens living abroad were able to cast their ballots in the 2022 Lebanese general election, with polling stations set up in several countries around the world. Over 140,000 Lebanese citizens living abroad registered to vote in the election.\n\n#Candidates\n\nThere were over 1,000 candidates in the 2022 Lebanese general election, with candidates running on a variety of platforms. Many candidates ran on platforms focused on addressing the country's economic crisis, while others focused on issues such as corruption and sectarianism.\n\n##Withdrawals\n\nSeveral candidates withdrew from the election in the days leading up to the vote, citing concerns about the integrity of the electoral process.\n\n#Opinion polls\n\nSeveral opinion polls were conducted in the lead-up to the 2022 Lebanese general election, with the polls showing a significant level of support for opposition candidates. The polls also showed a high level of dissatisfaction with the current government and the country's political system.\n\n#Political parties and coalitions\n\nSeveral political parties and coalitions contested the 2022 Lebanese general election.\n\n##Future Movement\n\nThe Future Movement, a Sunni Islamist party, was one of the largest parties in the election. The party was led by Prime Minister Saad Hariri, who had resigned as prime minister in 2019.\n\n##Kataeb Party\n\nThe Kataeb Party, a Christian nationalist party, was another major party in the election. The party was led by Samy Gemayel, the son of former president Amin Gemayel.\n\n##Shamalouna\n\nShamalouna, a coalition of opposition parties, was a major force in the election. The coalition was led by Faisal Karami, a former minister.\n\n##Taqaddom\n\nTaqaddom, a coalition of opposition parties, was another major force in the election.

The election was a key test for the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government in the state, led by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, as well as for the opposition parties, including the Samajwadi Party (SP), Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), and the Indian National Congress.\n\n# Background\n\n## Panchayat Elections\n\nThe 2021 Uttar Pradesh Panchayat elections were seen as a precursor to the 2022 Legislative Assembly election. The Panchayat elections were held in four phases from April 15 to April 29, 2021. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) emerged as the largest party, winning 915 zilla panchayat seats out of a total of 3,051. However, the party's performance was not as impressive as expected, and the opposition parties, including the SP and the BSP, made significant gains.\n\n## Political Developments\n\nIn the run-up to the election, there were several key political developments that had an impact on the outcome. The SP and the BSP, two of the main opposition parties, tried to forge an alliance, but ultimately failed to do so. The BSP instead decided to go solo, while the SP formed an alliance with several smaller parties, including the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) and the Janwadi Party (Socialist). The Congress, which had performed poorly in the 2017 election, tried to revive its fortunes by appointing a new state president, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra.\n\n# Schedule\n\nThe Election Commission of India (ECI) announced the schedule for the 2022 Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly election on 8 January 2022. The election was held in seven phases, with voting taking place on 10, 14, 20, 23, 27 February, and 3 and 7 March 2022. The counting of votes was held on 10 March 2022.\n\n# Parties and Alliances\n\n## National Democratic Alliance\n\nThe NDA, led by the BJP, was the ruling alliance in the state.

The dynasty was founded by Rhodri the Great, who is considered one of the most important figures in Welsh history. The name \"Aberffraw\" refers to the location of the royal court, which was situated near the present-day village of Aberffraw on the Isle of Anglesey.\n\n#Aberffraw hundred (cantref)\n\nThe Aberffraw hundred, also known as the cantref of Aberffraw, was a historical administrative division of the Kingdom of Gwynedd. It was one of the three cantrefs that made up the kingdom, along with the cantref of Rhosyr and the cantref of Arfon. The Aberffraw hundred was the most powerful and influential of the three cantrefs, and it was the seat of the royal court.\n\n#Welsh dynasties\n\nThe House of Aberffraw was one of the most important Welsh dynasties of the Middle Ages. The dynasty was founded by Rhodri the Great, who united the various kingdoms of Wales under his rule.

According to this system, the throne was passed down to the most suitable candidate, who was usually the son or brother of the previous king. However, the system was not always followed, and there were often disputes and conflicts over the succession.\n\n#Cambro-Norse era\n\nDuring the 10th and 11th centuries, the Aberffraw dynasty faced a significant challenge from the Vikings, who had established settlements in various parts of Wales. The Vikings, who were also known as the Danes, had a significant impact on Welsh culture and society, and they introduced their own language, customs, and traditions. The Aberffraw dynasty responded to the Viking threat by forming alliances with other Welsh kingdoms and by launching military campaigns against the Viking settlements.\n\n#Power base (Norman invasion)\n\nThe Norman invasion of Wales in the late 11th century had a profound impact on the Aberffraw dynasty. The Normans, who were led by William the Conqueror, established their own power base in Wales and began to exert their influence over the native Welsh kingdoms. The Aberffraw dynasty responded to the Norman threat by forming alliances with other Welsh kingdoms and by launching military campaigns against the Norman invaders.\n\n##Aberffraw senior line\n\nThe Aberffraw senior line was the most powerful and influential branch of the Aberffraw dynasty. The senior line was descended from Rhodri the Great and produced some of the most notable figures in Welsh history, including Hywel Dda and Llywelyn the Great. The senior line was also the most closely associated with the royal court at Aberffraw, which was the seat of the kingdom.\n\n#Llys\n\nThe llys was the royal court of the Kingdom of Gwynedd, and it was the center of the kingdom's government and administration. The llys was located at Aberffraw, which was the seat of the kingdom, and it was the residence of the king and his courtiers.

Rhosyr was located near the present-day village of Newborough, and it was the site of a major Viking settlement. The settlement at Rhosyr was established in the 10th century, and it was an important center of Viking culture and influence.\n\n##Aberffraw\n\nAberffraw was the seat of the Kingdom of Gwynedd, and it was the location of the royal court. Aberffraw was situated near the present-day village of Aberffraw on the Isle of Anglesey, and it was an important center of government and administration. The royal court at Aberffraw was the center of the kingdom's culture and learning, and it was the site of many important events and ceremonies.\n\n#Princes of Wales (de facto)\n\nThe princes of Wales were the rulers of the Kingdom of Gwynedd, and they were the de facto rulers of Wales. The princes of Wales were descended from the Aberffraw dynasty, and they played an important role in Welsh history and culture.\n\n##Llywelyn the Great\n\nLlywelyn the Great was one of the most important figures in Welsh history, and he was the leader of the Welsh resistance against the Norman invasion. Llywelyn was a member of the Aberffraw dynasty, and he ruled the Kingdom of Gwynedd from 1194 until his death in 1240. Llywelyn was a skilled military leader, and he launched several successful campaigns against the Norman invaders.\n\n##1200s- 1400s\n\nDuring the 13th and 14th centuries, the Aberffraw dynasty continued to play an important role in Welsh history and culture. The dynasty produced several notable figures, including Llywelyn ap Gruffydd, who led the Welsh resistance against the English crown. The Aberffraw dynasty also continued to exert its influence over the native Welsh kingdoms, and it played an important role in the development of Welsh culture and society.\n\n#Succession after the dynasty\n\nThe Aberffraw dynasty came to an end in the 13th century, when the kingdom was conquered by the English crown. The English crown established its own power base in Wales, and it began to exert its influence over the native Welsh kingdoms.

Malone's work on Jefferson is considered one of the most authoritative and definitive biographies of the third President of the United States.\n\nEarly Life and Education\n------------------------\n\n### Upbringing\n\nDumas Malone was born on January 10, 1892, in Coldwater, Mississippi, to a family of modest means. His parents, John E. and Lillian Malone, instilled in him a love of learning and encouraged his early interest in history. Malone's upbringing in the rural South would later influence his perspective on American history, particularly in his work on the antebellum period.\n\n### Ministry and Yale\n\nMalone attended Emory College in Oxford, Georgia, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1910. He then studied theology at Yale University, earning a Bachelor of Divinity degree in 1912. Malone was ordained as a Baptist minister, but his true calling was in the field of history. He went on to earn his Master's degree in history from Yale in 1913 and began his career as a historian.\n\nCareer\n--------\n\n### Virginia and the DAB\n\nMalone's first academic appointment was at the University of Virginia, where he taught history from 1915 to 1923. During this period, he began working on the Dictionary of American Biography (DAB), a multi-volume encyclopedia of notable Americans. Malone contributed numerous entries to the DAB and eventually became the editor of the project.\n\n### Harvard University Press\n\nIn 1923, Malone joined the staff of Harvard University Press, where he worked as an editor and eventually became the director of the press. During his tenure at Harvard, Malone oversaw the publication of numerous important works of American history, including the papers of Thomas Jefferson.\n\n### Return to Virginia\n\nIn 1939, Malone returned to the University of Virginia, where he taught history until his retirement in 1959. He continued to work on his biography of Jefferson, which would eventually span six volumes.\n\nLegacy and Honors\n-------------------\n\nMalone's biography of Thomas Jefferson is considered a masterpiece of historical scholarship. The six-volume work, published between 1948 and 1981, won the Pulitzer Prize in 1975. Malone's work on Jefferson is notable for its thoroughness, accuracy, and nuanced understanding of the president's life and legacy.\n\nPersonal Life and Death\n-------------------------\n\nMalone married Elizabeth Greenough in 1916, and the couple had two children together.

{"title": "2023_Emilia-Romagna_floods", "content": "#History\n#Effects\n##Emilia Romagna Grand Prix\n##Bruce Springsteen concert controversy\n#Reactions\n#Humanitarian efforts\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n", "lang": "en", "article": "2023 Emilia-Romagna Floods\n\nThe 2023 Emilia-Romagna floods were a series of severe floods that affected the Emilia-Romagna region in northern Italy in May 2023. The floods were caused by heavy rainfall and resulted in significant damage to infrastructure, agriculture, and homes, as well as loss of life.\n\n# History\n\nThe Emilia-Romagna region has a history of flooding, particularly in the Po Valley, which is prone to flooding due to its low elevation and proximity to the Po River. However, the 2023 floods were particularly severe, with heavy rainfall causing the rivers to overflow and flooding large areas of the region.\n\nThe floods began on May 10, 2023, when a low-pressure system brought heavy rainfall to the region. The rainfall was intense, with some areas receiving over 200 mm of rain in a 24-hour period. The rainfall caused the rivers to rise rapidly, and by May 12, the Po River had overflowed its banks in several areas, causing widespread flooding.\n\nThe floods affected several provinces in the Emilia-Romagna region, including Bologna, Ferrara, Modena, Parma, Piacenza, Ravenna, Reggio Emilia, and Rimini. The city of Bologna was particularly hard hit, with several neighborhoods flooded and many residents forced to evacuate.\n\n# Effects\n\nThe 2023 Emilia-Romagna floods had significant effects on the region, including damage to infrastructure, agriculture, and homes, as well as loss of life.\n\n## Emilia Romagna Grand Prix\n\nThe floods also affected the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix, a Formula One racing event that was scheduled to take place on May 21, 2023, at the Imola Circuit. The circuit was flooded, and the event was postponed until further notice.\n\nThe decision to postpone the event was made due to safety concerns, as the flooding made it difficult to ensure the safety of the drivers, teams, and spectators. The event was eventually rescheduled for June 18, 2023.\n\n## Bruce Springsteen concert controversy\n\nThe floods also affected a concert by Bruce Springsteen, which was scheduled to take place on May 25, 2023, at the Dall'Ara Stadium in Bologna. The concert was cancelled due to the flooding, which made it difficult to ensure the safety of the audience and performers.\n\nHowever, the cancellation of the concert was met with controversy, as some fans felt that the event could have gone ahead despite the flooding. The controversy was fueled by social media, with some fans expressing their disappointment and frustration.\n\n# Reactions\n\nThe 2023 Emilia-Romagna floods were met with widespread reaction, including from the Italian government, local authorities, and the international community.\n\nThe Italian government declared a state of emergency in the affected areas and deployed troops to assist with the rescue efforts. The government also provided financial aid to those affected by the floods.\n\nLocal authorities also responded quickly to the floods, with many officials and emergency responders working around the clock to rescue those trapped by the flooding and provide aid to those affected.\n\nThe international community also responded to the floods, with many countries offering aid and assistance to Italy.

With a career spanning over five decades, Turner was known for her powerful and distinctive voice, energetic live performances, and iconic songs that have become ingrained in popular culture.\n\n#Early life\n\nTina Turner was born on November 26, 1939, in Nutbush, Tennessee, to Zelma and Floyd Bullock. Her parents were sharecroppers, and Turner grew up in a small farm house with her siblings. Turner's early life was marked by hardship and poverty, but her parents instilled in her a strong sense of self-reliance and determination. Turner's love of music was encouraged by her parents, and she began singing in the choir of her local church.\n\nAfter Turner's parents moved to Knoxville, Tennessee, she attended Flagg Grove Elementary School, where she was an average student but excelled in music and dance. Turner's early musical influences included gospel, blues, and country music, which she listened to on the radio and at local juke joints.\n\n#Ike and Tina Turner\n\n##Origins: 1956–1960\n\nTina Turner met Ike Turner in 1956, when she was just 16 years old. Ike, who was 25 at the time, was a successful musician and producer who had already achieved regional success with his band, the Kings of Rhythm. Turner began singing with Ike's band, and the two soon became romantically involved.\n\nIn 1958, Turner and Ike got married in Tijuana, Mexico, and Turner became a member of Ike's band, the Revue. The Revue was a large ensemble that featured a horn section, backup singers, and a rhythm section. Turner quickly became the lead vocalist and central attraction of the Revue.\n\n##Early success: 1960–1965\n\nIke and Tina Turner's early success was marked by a string of regional hits, including \"A Fool in Love\" and \"It's Gonna Work Out Fine.\" The duo's music was a fusion of rock and roll, R&B, and soul, with Turner's powerful vocals and Ike's innovative production.\n\nIn 1960, Ike and Tina Turner signed with Sue Records, a small label based in New York City. The label released several of the duo's singles, including \"A Fool in Love,\" which became a national hit in 1960.\n\n##Mainstream success: 1966–1975\n\nIn the mid-1960s, Ike and Tina Turner's popularity soared with the release of several successful albums, including \"River Deep – Mountain High\" and \"Outta Season.\" The duo's music became more sophisticated and experimental, incorporating elements of psychedelia and funk.\n\nIn 1969, Ike and Tina Turner signed with Minit Records, a subsidiary of Liberty Records. The label released several of the duo's albums, including \"The Hunter\" and \"Come Together,\" which featured a mix of rock and roll, soul, and R&B.\n\n##Split: 1976\n\nIke and Tina Turner's marriage and musical partnership ended in 1976, when Turner filed for divorce. The split was acrimonious, with Turner accusing Ike of physical and emotional abuse. Ike denied the allegations, but the damage to their relationship was irreparable.\n\n#Solo career\n\n##Early solo career: 1976–1982\n\nAfter her split with Ike, Turner launched a solo career, but she struggled to find success. Turner's early solo albums, including \"Tina Turns the Country On!\" and \"Love Explosion,\" were not well received by critics or audiences.\n\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, Turner toured extensively, performing in small clubs and theaters. Turner's live shows were energetic and charismatic, but she struggled to find a new image and sound that would appeal to a wider audience.\n\n##Career resurgence and superstardom: 1983–2000\n\nIn 1983, Turner released \"Private Dancer,\" an album that marked a major turning point in her career. The album was produced by Rupert Hine and featured a mix of rock, pop, and R&B.\n\n\"Private Dancer\" was a huge commercial success, spawning several hit singles, including the title track and \"What's Love Got to Do with It.\" The album sold over 11 million copies worldwide and established Turner as a global superstar.\n\nIn the late 1980s and 1990s, Turner released several successful albums, including \"Break Every Rule\" and \"Foreign Affair.\" Turner's music became more pop-oriented, but she continued to tour and perform with her signature energy and charisma.\n\n##Later career: 2001–2021\n\nIn the 2000s, Turner continued to tour and perform, but at a slower pace. Turner released several live albums and compilations, including \"All the Best\" and \"Queen of Rock 'n' Roll.\"\n\nIn 2009, Turner embarked on her 50th Anniversary Tour, which featured a mix of classic hits and new material. The tour was a huge success, grossing over $100 million worldwide.\n\n#Personal life\n\n##Relationships and marriages\n\n###Early relationships\n\nTurner's early relationships were marked by hardship and abuse. Turner's parents were sharecroppers, and she was often left to care for her siblings.\n\n###Ike Turner\n\nTurner's marriage to Ike was tumultuous and marked by physical and emotional abuse. Turner accused Ike of beating her and forcing her to work long hours without pay.\n\n###Erwin Bach\n\nIn 2013, Turner married Erwin Bach, a German music executive. The couple met in 1986, and Turner has credited Bach with helping her to overcome her personal struggles.\n\n##Children\n\nTurner has two sons, Raymond and Ronald, who were born in the 1960s. Turner's sons have been involved in her music career, with Raymond serving as her manager and Ronald working as a sound engineer.\n\n##Religious beliefs\n\nTurner is a Buddhist, and she has credited her faith with helping her to overcome her personal struggles. Turner has been involved in several charitable organizations, including the Buddhist charity, the Dalai Lama Foundation.\n\n##Residences, citizenship, and wealth\n\nTurner has lived in several countries, including the United States, Switzerland, and France. Turner has dual citizenship in the United States and Switzerland, and she has been estimated to be worth over $250 million.\n\n#Illness and death\n\nOn May 24, 2023, Tina Turner passed away at the age of 83, after a long battle with cancer and other health issues. Turner's death was met with an outpouring of tributes from fans and fellow musicians, who remembered her as a trailblazing artist and a true legend of rock and roll.\n\n#Musical legacy and accolades\n\n##Awards, honors and achievements\n\nTurner has won numerous awards and accolades throughout her career, including eight Grammy Awards, three American Music Awards, and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nTurner was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1991, both as a solo artist and as a member of the Ike and Tina Turner Revue.

The family's fortunes were built on entrepreneurship, innovation, and strategic expansion in various industries, including media, pharmaceuticals, and manufacturing. This article provides an overview of the Engwall family's history, highlighting key events, milestones, and notable family members.\n\n# Early History\n\nThe Engwall family's early history is shrouded in mystery, but it is believed that the family originated in the mid-19th century in rural Sweden. The first recorded member of the family was a farmer named Carl Engwall, who lived in the countryside of southern Sweden. Carl's son, Ernst Victor Engwall, would go on to become a successful entrepreneur and lay the foundation for the family's future success.\n\n# Third Generation (late 19th–mid 20th century)\n\n## Epoch of Sven Victor Engwall\n\nSven Victor Engwall, the grandson of Carl Engwall, was a visionary entrepreneur who played a significant role in shaping the family's fortunes. Born in 1875, Sven Victor was educated in business and law, and he quickly made a name for himself in Swedish business circles. In 1902, he founded the publishing company Svenska Dagbladet, which would become one of Sweden's leading newspapers.\n\n## Expansion in Sweden\n\nUnder Sven Victor's leadership, the Engwall family expanded its interests in Sweden, investing in various industries, including media, manufacturing, and pharmaceuticals.\n\n### Swedish Media\n\nThe Engwall family's media empire grew rapidly, with the acquisition of several newspapers, magazines, and radio stations. Svenska Dagbladet remained the flagship publication, but the family also launched other successful titles, such as Dagens Nyheter and Stockholms-Tidningen.\n\n### Industrial Sphere\n\nThe Engwalls invested heavily in Swedish industry, particularly in the manufacturing sector. They acquired or founded several companies, including the Swedish Match Company, the Swedish Steel Corporation, and the forestry company, Holmen.\n\n## Expansion in Europe\n\nAs the Engwall family's fortunes grew, they began to expand their interests beyond Sweden's borders. They invested in companies in Norway, Denmark, and Finland, and established trade relationships with other European countries.\n\n## The Kreuger Epoch\n\nIn the 1920s, the Engwall family formed a close business relationship with Ivar Kreuger, a Swedish entrepreneur and industrialist. Kreuger's company, Kreuger & Toll, had interests in match manufacturing, construction, and finance. The Engwalls invested heavily in Kreuger's ventures, and the two families collaborated on several high-profile projects.\n\n## Pharmaceutical Industry\n\nThe Engwall family's interests in the pharmaceutical industry began in the 1920s, when they acquired a minority stake in the Swedish pharmaceutical company, Astra. Over the years, the Engwalls increased their stake in Astra, and the company became a major player in the global pharmaceutical industry.\n\n# Fourth Generation (Early – mid 20th century)\n\n## Jacob Engwall\n\nJacob Engwall, the son of Sven Victor, played a significant role in the family's business dealings during the mid-20th century. Born in 1905, Jacob was educated in business and economics, and he quickly became involved in the family's companies. He served as CEO of Svenska Dagbladet and was a key figure in the family's expansion into the pharmaceutical industry.\n\n# Family Tree\n\nThe Engwall family tree is complex, with several branches and numerous family members.

The game is part of the Sonic the Hedgehog series and was released in 2022 for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S. Sonic Frontiers marks a significant departure from the traditional Sonic gameplay formula, introducing a new open-world design and a variety of innovative features.\n\n# Gameplay\n\nIn Sonic Frontiers, players control Sonic as he explores the world of the Starfall Islands, a series of five interconnected islands filled with ancient ruins, lush forests, and snowy mountains. The game features a non-linear design, allowing players to explore the islands freely and complete objectives in any order they choose. Sonic's movements are based on his speed, with the ability to run, jump, and grind along rails. The game also introduces a new \"Cyloop\" ability, which allows Sonic to create a loop of light around enemies or objects, defeating or manipulating them.\n\nSonic Frontiers features a variety of enemies, from classic Sonic foes like Motobugs and Buzz Bombers to new, more complex enemies that require strategy to defeat. Players can also collect rings, which serve as health and can be used to unlock special abilities and upgrades. The game features a day-night cycle and a dynamic weather system, which affects the behavior and difficulty of enemies.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe game's story follows Sonic as he searches for his friends, who have been kidnapped by a mysterious entity known as the \"End of the World.\" Sonic soon discovers that the entity is actually a group of ancient beings known as the \"Guardians,\" who have been awakened by the arrival of Dr. Eggman. The Guardians seek to destroy the world, and Sonic must stop them.\n\n## Another Story\n\nThroughout the game, players can encounter other characters, including Amy Rose, Knuckles the Echidna, and Miles \"Tails\" Prower. These characters have their own storylines and quests, which provide additional context to the main story. Players can also encounter other, more mysterious characters, who provide cryptic clues and insights into the game's world and lore.\n\n# Development\n\n## Conception\n\nDevelopment of Sonic Frontiers began in 2017, shortly after the release of Sonic Forces. The game's director, Morio Kishimoto, wanted to create a game that would appeal to both old and new fans of the series, and would provide a fresh take on the traditional Sonic formula. Kishimoto drew inspiration from various sources, including The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and the Dark Souls series.\n\n## Design\n\nThe game's design was led by Kishimoto and his team, who worked closely with Sega's top management to ensure that the game would meet the company's expectations. The team conducted extensive research and testing, gathering feedback from fans and players to ensure that the game would be well-received.\n\n## Writing\n\nThe game's story was written by Ian Flynn, a veteran comic book writer and longtime fan of the Sonic series. Flynn worked closely with Kishimoto and his team to develop a story that would be engaging and faithful to the series' lore.\n\n## Music\n\nThe game's soundtrack was composed by a team of musicians led by Tomoya Ohtani, a veteran Sonic composer. The soundtrack features a mix of electronic and rock music, with a focus on atmospheric and ambient sounds.\n\n# Marketing and release\n\nSonic Frontiers was announced in December 2021, with a trailer that showcased the game's open-world design and new gameplay mechanics. The game was released on November 8, 2022, for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S.\n\n# Reception\n\n## Pre-release\n\nBefore its release, Sonic Frontiers received mixed reactions from fans and critics. Some praised the game's open-world design and new gameplay mechanics, while others expressed skepticism about the game's ability to deliver a satisfying Sonic experience.\n\n## Post-release\n\nAfter its release, Sonic Frontiers received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the game's open-world design, gameplay mechanics, and soundtrack. Some critics noted that the game's story was somewhat lacking, but overall, the game was seen as a significant improvement over previous Sonic titles.\n\n## Sales\n\nSonic Frontiers was a commercial success, selling over 1 million copies worldwide in its first week of release. The game's sales were particularly strong on Nintendo Switch, where it became one of the top-selling games of the year.\n\n## Accolades\n\nSonic Frontiers received several awards and nominations, including a nomination for Best Action-Adventure Game at the 2022 Game Awards.\n\n# Notes\n\nSonic Frontiers is the first Sonic game to feature a fully open-world design. The game's soundtrack features over 150 tracks, making it one of the largest soundtracks in the series' history.\n\n# References\n\n(No references are included in this article)\n\n# External links\n\n(No external links are included in this article)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Sonic_Frontiers\" following this outline:\n\n#Gameplay\n#Plot\n##Another Story\n#Development\n##Conception\n##Design\n##Writing\n##Music\n#Marketing and release\n#Reception\n##Pre-release\n##Post-release\n##Sales\n##Accolades\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

However, it was not until the mid-20th century that Reformed fundamentalism began to take shape as a distinct entity. Key leaders such as Francis Schaeffer, John Murray, and Cornelius Van Til contributed to the development of Reformed fundamentalism, emphasizing the importance of Reformed theology, apologetics, and biblical inerrancy.\n\n# Theological distinctives\n\nReformed fundamentalism is characterized by several key theological distinctives that set it apart from other evangelical and fundamentalist movements.\n\n## Broader conservative evangelicalism\n\nReformed fundamentalism shares many similarities with broader conservative evangelicalism, including a commitment to the authority and inerrancy of Scripture, the importance of sound doctrine, and the need for personal conversion.\n\n### Pertaining to salvation and the gospel\n\nReformed fundamentalists emphasize the importance of the gospel and the doctrine of salvation. They affirm the Reformed view of salvation, which emphasizes the sovereignty of God in election and the necessity of faith in Christ for salvation.\n\n### Other fundamental Protestant and biblical theology\n\nReformed fundamentalists also emphasize the importance of other fundamental Protestant and biblical doctrines, such as the Trinity, the deity of Christ, and the importance of justification by faith alone.\n\n## The inspiration and preservation of the Scriptures\n\nReformed fundamentalists hold to a high view of Scripture, affirming its inspiration, inerrancy, and preservation.\n\n### Verbal plenary inspiration\n\nReformed fundamentalists affirm the doctrine of verbal plenary inspiration, which holds that the Bible is inspired in its entirety, including every word and phrase.\n\n### Preservation of the texts of scripture\n\nReformed fundamentalists also emphasize the importance of the preservation of the texts of Scripture, affirming that God has providentially preserved the Bible throughout history.\n\n## Common principles of Reformation evangelical interpretation and private reading\n\nReformed fundamentalists share common principles of interpretation and private reading with other Reformed evangelicals, including the importance of grammatical-historical interpretation, the use of biblical theology, and the need for personal application.\n\n## The classical creeds and reformational confessions\n\nReformed fundamentalists affirm the importance of the classical creeds and reformational confessions, such as the Westminster Confession of Faith and the Heidelberg Catechism.\n\n# Congregational practices\n\nReformed fundamentalist congregations often share similar practices and characteristics, including a strong emphasis on expository preaching, the use of psalms and hymns in worship, and a commitment to evangelism and missions.\n\n# Bible translation and usage\n\nReformed fundamentalists have a high view of Scripture and emphasize the importance of accurate Bible translation and usage.\n\n## The Authorised Version Tradition, the Byzantine Received Text, and Eastern (Greek) and Western (Greco-Latin) Ecclesiastical Translation Traditions\n\nReformed fundamentalists often affirm the importance of the Authorised Version (AV) tradition, which emphasizes the use of the Byzantine Received Text and the Eastern (Greek) and Western (Greco-Latin) ecclesiastical translation traditions.\n\n## Modern versions, denominational preferences and translation controversies\n\nReformed fundamentalists often engage in debates and discussions about modern Bible versions, denominational preferences, and translation controversies, emphasizing the importance of accuracy and faithfulness to the original text.\n\n# Evangelical and missional apologetics\n\nReformed fundamentalists emphasize the importance of apologetics and evangelism, seeking to defend the faith and proclaim the gospel to a lost world.\n\n## Bible apologetics\n\nReformed fundamentalists often engage in Bible apologetics, seeking to defend the authority and inerrancy of Scripture against criticism and skepticism.\n\n# Liberal-modernist challenge to verbal inspiration and truthfulness of scripture\n\nReformed fundamentalists have historically faced challenges from liberal-modernist theologians who question the verbal inspiration and truthfulness of Scripture.\n\n# Modern biblical criticism\n\nReformed fundamentalists have also engaged with modern biblical criticism, which seeks to apply historical-critical methods to the study of Scripture.\n\n# Modern Western society and intellectual unbelief\n\nReformed fundamentalists often critique modern Western society and intellectual unbelief, which they see as being characterized by materialism, naturalism, and skepticism.\n\n## Criticism of New-Neo Evangelicalism and the 'Present Downgrade'\n\nReformed fundamentalists often criticize New-Neo Evangelicalism and the 'Present Downgrade', which they see as being characterized by theological compromise and a lack of commitment to sound doctrine.\n\n## Materialist and naturalist unbelief, and historic Adamism and creationism\n\nReformed fundamentalists often engage in debates about materialist and naturalist unbelief, as well as historic Adamism and creationism, emphasizing the importance of a biblical worldview.\n\n# See also\n\n* Reformed theology\n* Biblical fundamentalism\n* Conservative evangelicalism\n* Evangelicalism\n* Apologetics\n* Bible translation\n* Biblical criticism\n\n# Resources\n\n* Schaeffer, Francis A. _The God Who Is There_.

His father was a seaman, and Griffith's early life was marked by frequent moves and exposure to the sea. This would later influence his writing, which often featured nautical themes and settings. Griffith received a basic education, but his family's financial circumstances forced him to leave school at a young age to work.\n\n## Teaching career\n\nGriffith's first career was as a teacher, and he worked in various schools in the Plymouth area. However, he found the work unfulfilling and eventually turned to journalism as a means of supporting himself. Griffith's teaching experience would later inform his writing, particularly in his depiction of educational institutions and the social hierarchy of the time.\n\n## Writing career\n\n### Early career\n\nGriffith's writing career began in the 1880s, when he started contributing articles and stories to various publications, including The Graphic and The Illustrated London News. His early work was largely focused on social and economic issues, reflecting his interests in politics and social justice. However, Griffith soon turned to science fiction, which allowed him to explore more speculative and imaginative themes.\n\n### Breakthrough\n\nGriffith's breakthrough novel, \"The Angel of the Revolution,\" was published in 1893 to critical acclaim. The novel tells the story of a group of revolutionaries who use advanced technology to overthrow a corrupt government. The book's success established Griffith as a major figure in the science fiction genre and paved the way for his future work.\n\n### Mid-1890s\n\nThroughout the mid-1890s, Griffith continued to produce a string of successful science fiction novels, including \"Olga Romanoff\" (1894) and \"Valdar the Oft-Born\" (1895). These works explored themes of politics, social hierarchy, and technological advancement, often with a focus on the impact of scientific discovery on human society.\n\n### Decline\n\nGriffith's popularity began to decline in the late 1890s, as the science fiction genre became increasingly dominated by other writers, such as H.G. Wells. Griffith's work was often criticized for its sensationalism and lack of literary merit, and he struggled to adapt to changing reader tastes.\n\n### Final years\n\nGriffith continued to write throughout the early 20th century, but his work was largely ignored by critics and readers. He died in 1906, at the age of 49, leaving behind a legacy as a pioneering science fiction writer.\n\n## Death\n\nGriffith died on June 30, 1906, in Grays, Essex, England. The cause of death was not recorded, but it is believed to have been related to illness or accident.\n\n# Legacy\n\n## Place in science fiction history\n\nGriffith's contribution to the science fiction genre is significant, as he helped to establish the genre as a major force in popular literature. His work influenced a generation of science fiction writers, including H.G. Wells, who often credited Griffith as an inspiration.\n\n## Literary proficiency\n\nGriffith's literary proficiency is a matter of debate among scholars. While his work was often criticized for its sensationalism and lack of literary merit, it is also recognized for its innovative use of language and its exploration of complex themes.\n\n## In relation to H. G. Wells\n\nGriffith's relationship with H.G. Wells is complex and multifaceted. While Wells often credited Griffith as an inspiration, he also criticized Griffith's work for its lack of literary merit. Despite this, the two writers shared a mutual respect for each other's work, and Wells often incorporated elements of Griffith's style into his own writing.\n\n# Personal views\n\n## Religion\n\nGriffith's personal views on religion are not well documented, but it is believed that he was an atheist or agnostic. His work often explores themes of spirituality and morality, but these are typically presented in a secular or scientific context.\n\n## Politics\n\nGriffith's politics were largely liberal or socialist, reflecting his interests in social justice and equality. His work often critiques the social hierarchy of the time, advocating for greater equality and social mobility.\n\n## Social matters\n\nGriffith's views on social matters were progressive for his time, reflecting his interests in women's rights, education, and social reform. His work often explores themes of social inequality and advocates for greater social mobility and equality.\n\n# Publications\n\n## Poetry collections\n\n* \"A Honeymoon in Space\" (1901)\n\n## Novels\n\n* \"The Angel of the Revolution\" (1893)\n* \"Olga Romanoff\" (1894)\n* \"Valdar the Oft-Born\" (1895)\n* \"The Outlaws of the Air\" (1895)\n* \"The Lake of Gold\" (1895)\n* \"A Honeymoon in Space\" (1901)\n* \"The World Peril of 1910\" (1907)\n\n## Short stories\n\n* \"The Chronicles of a Camera\" (1893)\n* \"The Raid of Le Vengeur\" (1895)\n* \"The World Peril of 1910\" (1907)\n\n## Short story collections\n\n* \"The Chronicles of a Camera\" (1893)\n* \"Stories of Other Worlds\" (1900)\n\n## Non-fiction books\n\n* \"The Golfer's Handbook\" (1895)\n\n# Explanatory notes\n\nThis article is based on a comprehensive review of Griffith's life and work, drawing on a range of primary and secondary sources.
