He is best known as the founder and former CEO of FTX, a cryptocurrency derivatives exchange that collapsed in 2022. Bankman-Fried was also the founder of Alameda Research, a quantitative trading firm that was closely tied to FTX.\n\nEarly life and education\n------------------------\n\nSam Bankman-Fried was born on March 6, 1992, in Stanford, California. He grew up in a Jewish family and was raised in a household that valued philanthropy and social responsibility. His parents, Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, are both professors at Stanford Law School. Bankman-Fried's parents instilled in him the importance of giving back to society, and he has credited them with shaping his views on philanthropy.\n\nBankman-Fried attended the Crystal Springs Uplands School in Hillsborough, California, before enrolling at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). At MIT, he studied physics and graduated in 2014. During his time at MIT, Bankman-Fried became interested in effective altruism, a philosophy that emphasizes using reason and evidence to maximize the impact of charitable giving.\n\nCareer\n--------\n\nAfter graduating from MIT, Bankman-Fried worked as a trader at Jane Street, a quantitative trading firm. In 2017, he left Jane Street to start his own trading firm, Alameda Research. Alameda Research quickly gained a reputation as a successful and innovative trading firm, and it became a major player in the cryptocurrency markets.\n\nIn 2019, Bankman-Fried founded FTX, a cryptocurrency derivatives exchange. FTX quickly gained popularity among cryptocurrency traders, and it became one of the largest and most influential exchanges in the world. Bankman-Fried served as the CEO of FTX until its collapse in 2022.\n\n### Views on charity and market regulation\n\nBankman-Fried has been a vocal advocate for effective altruism and has pledged to give away the majority of his wealth during his lifetime. He has also been a strong advocate for market regulation, particularly in the cryptocurrency industry. Bankman-Fried has argued that regulation is necessary to protect consumers and prevent market manipulation.\n\n### Bankruptcy of FTX\n\nIn November 2022, FTX filed for bankruptcy and Bankman-Fried resigned as CEO. The collapse of FTX was attributed to a combination of factors, including poor risk management, inadequate regulation, and a liquidity crisis. The collapse of FTX had a significant impact on the cryptocurrency markets, and it led to a wave of criticism of Bankman-Fried and his company.\n\nArrest and charges\n------------------\n\nOn December 12, 2022, Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas and charged with multiple counts of fraud and money laundering. The charges were related to the collapse of FTX and allegations that Bankman-Fried had misused customer funds. Bankman-Fried was extradited to the United States, where he was arraigned on the charges.\n\nUnited States v. Bankman-Fried\n-----------------------------\n\n### Trial conclusion\n\nBankman-Fried's trial began in October 2023 and concluded in November 2023. The trial was widely covered in the media, and it was seen as a major test of the US justice system's ability to hold cryptocurrency executives accountable for their actions.\n\n### Second trial dismissed\n\nIn January 2024, a second trial against Bankman-Fried was dismissed due to lack of evidence. The trial had been related to allegations of market manipulation, but prosecutors were unable to present sufficient evidence to support the charges.\n\n### Appeal\n\nBankman-Fried has appealed the conviction, arguing that the trial was unfair and that the charges were based on flawed evidence. The appeal is ongoing, and it is unclear when a decision will be made.\n\nIncarceration history\n--------------------\n\nBankman-Fried has been incarcerated since his arrest in December 2022. He is currently being held at the Federal Correctional Institution in Brooklyn, New York.\n\nDonations\n----------\n\nBankman-Fried has been a prolific donor to charitable causes, particularly those related to pandemic prevention and effective altruism.\n\n### Politics\n\n#### 2020 and earlier\n\nBankman-Fried has been a supporter of the Democratic Party and has donated to several Democratic candidates, including Andrew Yang and Joe Biden.\n\n#### 2021–2022\n\nIn 2021, Bankman-Fried donated $5 million to the Democratic National Committee. He also donated to several other Democratic candidates, including Stacey Abrams and Beto O'Rourke.\n\n#### 2022 U.S. midterm elections\n\nBankman-Fried was a major donor to the Democratic Party during the 2022 midterm elections. He donated over $40 million to Democratic candidates and causes, making him one of the largest donors of the cycle.\n\n### Pandemic prevention contributions and related controversy\n\nBankman-Fried has been a major supporter of pandemic prevention efforts, particularly those related to COVID-19. He has donated to several organizations, including the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nHowever, Bankman-Fried's support for pandemic prevention efforts has been the subject of controversy. Some have accused him of using his donations to influence public policy and advance his own interests.\n\n### Attempts to recoup donations\n\nIn 2023, several politicians and organizations attempted to recoup donations from Bankman-Fried due to the collapse of FTX and the ongoing investigation into his activities. However, it is unclear whether these efforts will be successful.\n\nPersonal life\n-------------\n\nBankman-Fried is known for his introspective and analytical personality. He has said that he is motivated by a desire to make a positive impact on the world and to leave a lasting legacy.\n\nBankman-Fried has been open about his struggles with mental health and has spoken publicly about the importance of seeking help and support.\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nThis article is a general overview of Sam Bankman-Fried's life and career.

The species has a unique history of discovery, taxonomy, and conservation efforts, which are detailed in this article.\n\n# Species discovery\n\nTorreya taxifolia was first discovered in 1835 by Hardy Bryan Croom, an American botanist, in the Apalachicola River valley of Florida. Croom collected specimens of the tree, which were later described by the American botanist John Torrey. However, it wasn't until the late 19th century that the species gained significant attention from botanists and foresters.\n\n# Taxonomy and naming\n\nTorreya taxifolia belongs to the family Taxaceae, which includes other coniferous trees such as yew and arborvitae. The genus Torreya was named in honor of John Torrey, who first described the species. The specific epithet taxifolia refers to the similarity between the leaves of Torreya and those of the yew tree (Taxus spp.).\n\n# Type species of genus Torreya\n\nTorreya taxifolia is the type species of the genus Torreya, which comprises six species worldwide. The genus Torreya is native to eastern Asia and southeastern North America.\n\n# Common names\n\nTorreya taxifolia has several common names, including Florida nutmeg, gopher wood, and stinking cedar. The name \"Florida nutmeg\" refers to the tree's native range in Florida and the aromatic properties of its seeds, which resemble nutmeg. The name \"gopher wood\" refers to the tree's association with gopher tortoises, which use the tree's roots as burrows. The name \"stinking cedar\" refers to the tree's distinctive, unpleasant odor.\n\n# Description\n\n## Technical description\n\nTorreya taxifolia is a medium-sized evergreen tree that grows up to 15 meters (49 feet) tall. The tree has a conical shape, with a straight trunk and horizontal branches. The leaves are dark green, lance-shaped, and arranged in a spiral pattern on the twigs. The leaves are 2-4 centimeters (0.8-1.6 inches) long and have a distinctive, unpleasant odor.\n\n## Subcanopy growth adaptations\n\nTorreya taxifolia has adapted to grow in the subcanopy of forests, where light is limited. The tree has developed a unique growth pattern, with a slow-growing, shrub-like habit in the early stages of development. As the tree matures, it produces a single, straight leader that grows towards the canopy.\n\n# Distribution\n\n## Wild population\n\nTorreya taxifolia is native to the southeastern United States, specifically in the Apalachicola River valley of Florida and the adjacent parts of Georgia and Alabama. The wild population of the species is estimated to be around 500-600 individuals, scattered across a range of 10-15 kilometers (6-9 miles).\n\n## Prehistoric distribution\n\nFossil records suggest that Torreya taxifolia had a wider distribution during the Pleistocene era, with fossil remains found in the southeastern United States and the Caribbean.\n\n# Ecology\n\n## Habitat\n\nTorreya taxifolia grows in the subcanopy of forests, typically on well-drained soils and in areas with moderate to high levels of rainfall. The tree is often associated with other species, such as magnolia, beech, and pine.\n\n## Seed dispersal\n\nTorreya taxifolia produces seeds that are dispersed by animals, particularly birds and small mammals. The seeds are an important food source for these animals, and the tree relies on them for seed dispersal.\n\n# Extinction threats\n\n## Vulnerabilities of restricted range size\n\nTorreya taxifolia is vulnerable to extinction due to its restricted range size. The species is only found in a small area of the southeastern United States, making it susceptible to environmental changes, disease, and human activities.\n\n## The die-off begins\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, Torreya taxifolia began to experience a significant die-off, with many trees dying or declining in health. The cause of the die-off was not immediately clear, but it was attributed to a combination of factors, including disease, pests, and environmental changes.\n\n## The role of pathogens in the die-off\n\nResearch has suggested that pathogens, such as fungi and bacteria, played a significant role in the die-off of Torreya taxifolia. The tree's restricted range and low population size made it more susceptible to disease.\n\n## The role of habitat deterioration in the die-off\n\nHabitat deterioration, including the degradation of soil quality and the reduction of rainfall, may have also contributed to the die-off of Torreya taxifolia. The tree's reliance on specific environmental conditions made it vulnerable to changes in its habitat.\n\n## Focus on a stem canker fungus\n\nOne pathogen that has been identified as a potential cause of the die-off is a stem canker fungus (Neonectria radicicola). The fungus was first identified in the 1960s and has been found to infect Torreya taxifolia trees, causing cankers and dieback.\n\n## Ultimate cause of die-off still unsolved\n\nDespite research, the ultimate cause of the die-off of Torreya taxifolia remains unsolved. It is likely that a combination of factors, including disease, habitat deterioration, and environmental changes, contributed to the decline of the species.\n\n# Conservation actions\n\n## Protect areas in species range\n\nConservation efforts have focused on protecting areas within the range of Torreya taxifolia. National parks, wildlife refuges, and other protected areas have been established to safeguard the species and its habitat.\n\n## List the species as endangered\n\nTorreya taxifolia was listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act in 1984. The listing has helped to raise awareness about the species and has provided funding for conservation efforts.\n\n## In situ habitat improvement\n\nConservation efforts have also focused on improving the habitat of Torreya taxifolia. This has included the removal of invasive species, the restoration of natural fire regimes, and the improvement of soil quality.\n\n## Ex situ genetic safeguarding\n\nEx situ conservation efforts have focused on safeguarding the genetic material of Torreya taxifolia. This has included the collection of seeds and the establishment of seed banks and nurseries.\n\n## Document early horticultural plantings\n\nEarly horticultural plantings of Torreya taxifolia have been documented, providing valuable information about the species' growth habits and requirements.\n\n# Conservation controversies\n\n## Assisted migration (the policy debate)\n\nThere is ongoing debate about the use of assisted migration as a conservation strategy for Torreya taxifolia. Assisted migration involves the intentional movement of species to new locations, often in response to climate change. Some argue that assisted migration could help to safeguard the species, while others argue that it could lead to unintended consequences.\n\n## Management of seeds produced ex situ\n\nThere is also debate about the management of seeds produced ex situ. Some argue that these seeds should be used for conservation efforts, while others argue that they should be made available to the public.\n\n### Seeds produced from official plantings\n\nSeeds produced from official plantings, such as those in botanical gardens, are often managed by conservation agencies. These seeds are typically used for conservation efforts, such as the establishment of new populations.\n\n### Seeds accessed by citizens\n\nSeeds accessed by citizens, such as those collected from wild populations, are often managed by individual landowners or collectors. These seeds may be used for personal purposes, such as horticulture, or they may be sold to others.\n\nIn conclusion, Torreya taxifolia is a rare and endangered coniferous tree species that is native to the southeastern United States. The species has a unique history of discovery, taxonomy, and conservation efforts, which are detailed in this article. Despite ongoing conservation efforts, the species remains vulnerable to extinction due to its restricted range size and the ongoing die-off. Further research and conservation efforts are needed to safeguard the species and its habitat.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Torreya_taxifolia\" following this outline:\n\n#Species discovery\n#Taxonomy and naming\n#Type species of genus Torreya\n#Common names\n#Description\n##Technical description\n##Subcanopy growth adaptations\n#Distribution\n##Wild population\n##Prehistoric distribution\n#Ecology\n##Habitat\n##Seed dispersal\n#Extinction threats\n##Vulnerabilities of restricted range size\n##The die-off begins\n##The role of pathogens in the die-off\n##The role of habitat deterioration in the die-off\n##Focus on a stem canker fungus\n##Ultimate cause of die-off still unsolved\n#Conservation actions\n##Protect areas in species range\n##List the species as endangered\n##In situ habitat improvement\n##Ex situ genetic safeguarding\n##Document early horticultural plantings\n#Conservation controversies\n##Assisted migration (the policy debate)\n##Management of seeds produced ex situ\n###Seeds produced from official plantings\n###Seeds accessed by citizens\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Native to the Mediterranean region, this plant has adapted to thrive in poor soil conditions and has developed unique strategies for survival and propagation.\n\n#Scientific Name\n\nThe scientific name Anagyris foetida is derived from the Greek words \"anagyris,\" meaning \"without a covering,\" and \"foetida,\" meaning \"foul-smelling.\" This refers to the plant's distinctive, unpleasant odor and the fact that its flowers lack a covering or calyx.\n\n#Common names\n\nAnagyris foetida has several common names, including stinking bean trefoil, Mediterranean stinkbush, and bean trefoil. These names reflect the plant's strong, unpleasant odor and its resemblance to trefoil, a common legume.\n\n#Distribution\n\nAnagyris foetida is native to the Mediterranean region, where it can be found in countries such as Greece, Turkey, Italy, and Spain. It has also been naturalized in other parts of the world, including the southwestern United States and Australia.\n\n#Habitat\n\nAnagyris foetida typically grows in poor soil conditions, such as rocky outcrops, dry scrublands, and disturbed areas. It is well adapted to survive in areas with limited water availability and can thrive in full sun to partial shade.\n\n#Adaptations to growth in Winter and early Spring\n\n##Summer leaf-fall\n\nAnagyris foetida has a unique adaptation to conserve water during the hot, dry summer months. As temperatures rise, the plant's leaves fall off, allowing it to conserve water and reduce transpiration. This adaptation, known as summer leaf-fall, allows the plant to survive in areas with limited water availability.\n\n##Pollination by birds\n\nAnagyris foetida is pollinated by birds, which are attracted to its bright yellow flowers. The plant's flowers are rich in nectar, which provides a source of energy for the birds. In return, the birds transfer pollen between flowers, allowing the plant to reproduce.\n\n#Seed dispersal\n\nAnagyris foetida has a complex seed dispersal strategy, involving multiple vectors and adaptations.\n\n##Soil seed banks\n\nThe plant's seeds can remain dormant in the soil for extended periods, forming a seed bank. This allows the seeds to germinate when conditions are favorable, increasing the plant's chances of survival.\n\n##Olive mimicry\n\nThe seeds of Anagyris foetida resemble those of the olive tree, which is a valuable crop in the Mediterranean region. As a result, the seeds may be harvested and dispersed by humans, who mistake them for olive seeds.\n\n##Role of sheep\n\nSheep play an important role in the seed dispersal of Anagyris foetida. The seeds are ingested by sheep, which then deposit them in new locations, often in areas with favorable growing conditions.\n\n##Other possible mammalian and avian vectors\n\nIn addition to sheep, other mammals and birds may also contribute to the seed dispersal of Anagyris foetida. For example, rabbits, deer, and birds such as starlings and sparrows may all play a role in dispersing the plant's seeds.\n\n##Unknown seed dispersal vector\n\nDespite research, the exact mechanism of seed dispersal in Anagyris foetida remains unclear. It is likely that multiple vectors contribute to the plant's dispersal, and further study is needed to fully understand this process.\n\n##Tough, waterproof seed coats\n\nThe seeds of Anagyris foetida have a tough, waterproof coat that protects them from damage and allows them to survive in a variety of environments. This adaptation increases the plant's chances of survival and allows it to disperse its seeds over long distances.\n\n#Value as a nitrogen-fixing pioneer and companion plant\n\nAnagyris foetida is a nitrogen-fixing plant, meaning that it has the ability to convert atmospheric nitrogen into a form that can be used by other plants. This makes it a valuable pioneer plant, able to thrive in poor soil conditions and improve the fertility of the soil for other plants. It is also a useful companion plant, providing shade and improving soil health for other crops.\n\n#Medicinal use\n\nAnagyris foetida has been used in traditional medicine for centuries, particularly in the treatment of respiratory problems such as bronchitis and asthma. The plant's leaves and flowers contain compounds that have anti-inflammatory and expectorant properties, making it a useful remedy for coughs and congestion.\n\n#Toxicity\n\n##Alkaloid anagyrine a cause of birth defects\n\nAnagyris foetida contains a toxic alkaloid called anagyrine, which has been linked to birth defects in animals. Pregnant women should avoid ingesting the plant or its extracts, as anagyrine can cross the placenta and cause harm to the developing fetus.\n\n##Danger to children\n\nThe plant's seeds are particularly toxic to children, who may ingest them accidentally. The seeds contain high levels of anagyrine, which can cause vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain in children.\n\n##Hazardous tainting of milk products\n\nAnagyris foetida can also contaminate milk products, such as cheese and yogurt, if the plant's seeds or leaves are ingested by dairy animals. This can pose a risk to human health, particularly for pregnant women and children.\n\n##Case of accidental poisoning in Algeria\n\nIn 2017, a case of accidental poisoning was reported in Algeria, where a child ingested the seeds of Anagyris foetida. The child suffered from vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, but recovered after treatment.\n\n#Cultural references: Anagyris and Anagyrous\n\n##Lysistrata\n\nIn Aristophanes' play Lysistrata, the character of Myrrhine mentions Anagyris foetida as a plant that is used to treat sexual impotence. This reference highlights the plant's long history of use in traditional medicine.\n\n##Persistence of name\n\nThe name Anagyris foetida has persisted in botanical and medical literature for centuries, reflecting the plant's importance and its enduring relevance in modern times.\n\n#Gallery\n\n##Anagyris foetida\n\n* Image of Anagyris foetida in bloom\n* Close-up of the plant's flowers\n* Photo of the plant's distinctive seed pods\n\n##Avian pollinators\n\n* Image of a bird visiting the plant's flowers\n* Photo of a bee collecting nectar from the plant's flowers\n\n##Avian nectar thief\n\n* Image of a bird stealing nectar from the plant's flowers\n* Photo of a bird with a beak full of nectar\n\n##Insect pollinators\n\n* Image of a bee collecting pollen from the plant's flowers\n* Photo of a butterfly visiting the plant's flowers\n\n#See also\n\n* List of plants with toxic seeds\n* Nitrogen-fixing plants\n* Mediterranean flora\n* Traditional medicine", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Anagyris_foetida\" following this outline:\n\n#Scientific Name\n#Common names\n#Distribution\n#Habitat\n#Adaptations to growth in Winter and early Spring\n##Summer leaf-fall\n##Pollination by birds\n#Seed dispersal\n##Soil seed banks\n##Olive mimicry\n##Role of sheep\n##Other possible mammalian and avian vectors\n##Unknown seed dispersal vector\n##Tough, waterproof seed coats\n#Value as a nitrogen-fixing pioneer and companion plant\n#Medicinal use\n#Toxicity\n##Alkaloid anagyrine a cause of birth defects\n##Danger to children\n##Hazardous tainting of milk products\n##Case of accidental poisoning in Algeria\n#Cultural references: Anagyris and Anagyrous\n##Lysistrata\n##Persistence of name\n#Gallery\n##Anagyris foetida\n##Avian pollinators\n##Avian nectar thief\n##Insect pollinators\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The company has gained international attention for its expeditions to the wreck of the Titanic, but has also faced tragedy and criticism. This article provides an overview of the company's background, history, submersibles, and associated entities.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nOceanGate was founded with the goal of making underwater exploration more accessible and affordable. The company's founders aimed to create a platform that would allow people to experience the ocean in a way that was previously only available to a select few. OceanGate's approach involves designing and building submersibles that are capable of taking people to great depths, while also providing a safe and comfortable experience.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### 2009–2013: Founding and acquisition of Antipodes\n\nOceanGate was founded in 2009 by a group of entrepreneurs who shared a passion for underwater exploration. The company's early years were focused on developing a business plan and acquiring the necessary resources to build its first submersible. In 2011, OceanGate acquired the Antipodes submersible, which was designed and built by engineer and inventor, Steve Gatto. The Antipodes was a two-person submersible that was capable of reaching depths of up to 300 meters.\n\n### 2013–2016: Construction of Cyclops and Söhnlein's departure\n\nIn 2013, OceanGate began construction of its second submersible, the Cyclops 1. The Cyclops 1 was a five-person submersible that was designed to reach depths of up to 500 meters. The submersible was named after the Cyclops, a mythological one-eyed giant, due to its unique design feature of a single, large acrylic sphere that provided an unobstructed view of the underwater environment. During this period, one of the company's co-founders, Guillermo Söhnlein, left the company to pursue other ventures.\n\n### 2016–2023: Expansion of fleet and dives to the Titanic\n\nBetween 2016 and 2023, OceanGate expanded its fleet of submersibles to include the Titan, a five-person submersible that was designed to reach depths of up to 4,000 meters. The Titan was specifically designed for expeditions to the wreck of the Titanic, which lies at a depth of approximately 3,800 meters. During this period, OceanGate conducted several successful dives to the Titanic, with the company's submersibles carrying scientists, explorers, and adventure tourists to the wreck site.\n\n### 2023: Implosion of Titan and death of Rush\n\nOn June 18, 2023, tragedy struck when the Titan submersible imploded while on a dive to the Titanic wreck site, resulting in the death of OceanGate's CEO, Stockton Rush, and four other people on board. The incident was widely reported in the media and raised questions about the safety of OceanGate's operations.\n\nSubmersibles\n------------\n\n### Antipodes\n\nThe Antipodes is a two-person submersible that was designed and built by Steve Gatto. The submersible is capable of reaching depths of up to 300 meters and has a unique design feature of a spherical hull that provides an unobstructed view of the underwater environment.\n\n### Cyclops 1\n\nThe Cyclops 1 is a five-person submersible that was designed and built by OceanGate. The submersible is capable of reaching depths of up to 500 meters and features a large acrylic sphere that provides an unobstructed view of the underwater environment.\n\n### Titan\n\nThe Titan is a five-person submersible that was designed and built by OceanGate. The submersible is capable of reaching depths of up to 4,000 meters and was specifically designed for expeditions to the wreck of the Titanic. The Titan features a unique design feature of a titanium hull that provides strength and durability.\n\nAssociated entities\n-------------------\n\nOceanGate has partnerships with several organizations and companies, including research institutions, tourism operators, and equipment suppliers. The company also has a network of investors and advisors who provide support and guidance.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Deep-sea exploration\n* Submersible\n* Titanic\n* Underwater tourism\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nFurther reading\n---------------\n\n* \"OceanGate: A New Era in Underwater Exploration\" by Stockton Rush\n* \"The Future of Underwater Exploration: An Interview with OceanGate's CEO\" by Forbes\n* \"OceanGate's Titan Submersible: A Game-Changer for Deep-Sea Exploration\" by Wired\n\nExternal links\n---------------\n\n* OceanGate website\n* OceanGate Twitter page\n* OceanGate Facebook page", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"OceanGate\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#History\n##2009–2013: Founding and acquisition of Antipodes\n##2013–2016: Construction of Cyclops and Söhnlein's departure\n##2016–2023: Expansion of fleet and dives to the Titanic\n##2023: Implosion of Titan and death of Rush\n#Submersibles\n##Antipodes\n##Cyclops 1\n##Titan\n#Associated entities\n#See also\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The conflict has resulted in significant human suffering, displacement, and economic disruption, and has drawn international attention and condemnation.\n\n# Background\n\n## Post-Soviet relations\n\nFollowing the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine and Russia established diplomatic relations, with Ukraine declaring independence and Russia recognizing it as a sovereign state. However, the relationship between the two countries has been complex and often tense, with disputes over territory, energy resources, and cultural identity.\n\n## Ukrainian revolution, Russian intervention in Crimea and Donbas\n\nIn 2014, a popular uprising in Ukraine led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych, who was seen as pro-Russian. Russia responded by annexing Crimea, a Ukrainian peninsula with strategic military importance, and supporting separatist movements in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. The conflict in eastern Ukraine, known as the Donbas War, has resulted in thousands of deaths and displaced millions of people.\n\n# Prelude\n\n## Putin's invasion announcement\n\nOn February 24, 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a \"special military operation\" in Ukraine, citing concerns about the security of Russian-speaking populations in eastern Ukraine and the need to \"demilitarize and denazify\" Ukraine. The announcement marked the beginning of a large-scale invasion of Ukraine, with Russian forces launching attacks on multiple fronts.\n\n# Events\n\n## Initial invasion (24 February – 7 April)\n\n### Kyiv and northern front\n\nRussian forces launched a major assault on the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, with the goal of capturing the city and overthrowing the government. However, Ukrainian forces put up significant resistance, and the Russian advance was slowed. The city was subjected to intense shelling and bombing, causing widespread damage and civilian casualties.\n\n### Northeastern front\n\nRussian forces also launched an attack on the northeastern city of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city. The city was heavily shelled, and Ukrainian forces fought back, but Russian forces made gains in the surrounding areas.\n\n### Southern front\n\nRussian forces launched an attack on the southern city of Mariupol, a strategic port city on the Sea of Azov. The city was heavily shelled, and Ukrainian forces fought back, but Russian forces eventually captured the city.\n\n### Eastern front\n\nRussian forces launched an attack on the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, where separatist movements had been active since 2014. The conflict in the region intensified, with both sides suffering heavy losses.\n\n## Southeastern front (8 April – 5 September)\n\n### Fall of Mariupol\n\nAfter a prolonged siege, Mariupol fell to Russian forces on May 20, 2022.

The film's sets and costumes were designed to evoke the look and feel of the 1950s and 1960s, with a particular emphasis on the Fabelman family's home and the local movie theater.\n\n### Visual effects\n\nThe visual effects for the film were handled by a team of artists and technicians who worked to create a seamless blend of practical and digital effects. The film's visual effects were used to enhance the film's action sequences and to bring the world of the film to life.\n\nMusic\n=====\n\nThe score for the film was composed by John Williams, who has collaborated with Spielberg on many of his films.

His innovative ideas and inventions had a significant impact on the fields of engineering, mathematics, and computer science, and he is considered one of the most important Spanish scientists of the 20th century.\n\nEarly life and education\n------------------------\n\nLeonardo Torres Quevedo was born on December 28, 1852, in Santa Cruz de Iber, a small village in the province of Santander, Spain. He was the eldest of six children born to a family of modest means. His parents, both of whom were teachers, encouraged his interest in mathematics and science from an early age.\n\nTorres Quevedo attended the Colegio de la Inmaculada in Santander, where he developed a strong foundation in mathematics and physics. In 1870, he moved to Madrid to study civil engineering at the Escuela de Ingenieros de Caminos, Canales y Puertos. He graduated in 1876 and began working as a civil engineer on various projects in Spain.\n\nCareer\n--------\n\nTorres Quevedo's career spanned over five decades and was marked by numerous innovations and inventions. His work can be broadly categorized into several areas, including cableways, analogue calculating machines, aerostatics, radio control, formal language, laboratory of automation, chess automaton, essays on automatics, naval projects, and other inventions.\n\n### Cableways\n\nIn the late 1880s, Torres Quevedo began working on the development of cableways, a system of overhead cables used for transporting materials and people. He designed and built several cableway systems in Spain and abroad, including the famous cableway in the Niagara Falls.\n\n### Analogue calculating machines\n\nTorres Quevedo is credited with inventing the first electromechanical analogue calculating machine, which he called the \"aritmómetro.\" This machine was capable of performing basic arithmetic operations and was the precursor to modern computers.\n\n### Aerostatics\n\nIn the early 1900s, Torres Quevedo turned his attention to aerostatics, the study of the behavior of gases in equilibrium. He invented a device called the \"aerostatic integrator,\" which was used to calculate the area under curves.\n\n### Radio control: the Telekino\n\nIn 1903, Torres Quevedo invented the Telekino, a radio-controlled boat that was the precursor to modern remote-control devices. The Telekino was the first device to use radio waves to control the movement of an object.\n\n### Formal language\n\nTorres Quevedo was also interested in formal language and developed a system of notation for mathematical logic. His work in this area predated the development of modern computer programming languages.\n\n### Laboratory of Automation\n\nIn 1912, Torres Quevedo established the Laboratory of Automation in Madrid, which was dedicated to the development of automation and robotics. The laboratory became a hub for innovation and experimentation, and Torres Quevedo and his team developed numerous inventions and machines.\n\n### Chess automaton: El Ajedrecista\n\nIn 1912, Torres Quevedo built a chess automaton called El Ajedrecista, which was capable of playing chess against a human opponent. El Ajedrecista was the first chess-playing machine in the world and was a significant innovation in the field of artificial intelligence.\n\n### Essays on Automatics\n\nTorres Quevedo wrote several essays on automatics, including \"Essays on Automatics,\" which was published in 1914. In this book, he outlined his vision for a future where machines would be able to perform tasks autonomously.\n\n#### Analytical machines\n\nTorres Quevedo was also interested in analytical machines, which were capable of performing complex calculations. He developed several analytical machines, including the \"calculating machine,\" which was capable of performing arithmetic operations.\n\n### Naval projects\n\nTorres Quevedo worked on several naval projects, including the development of a submarine that could be controlled remotely. He also designed a system for launching torpedoes from submarines.\n\n### Other inventions and miscellaneous activities\n\nTorres Quevedo was a prolific inventor and developed numerous other inventions and machines, including a machine for making cigarettes, a machine for sorting mail, and a machine for making shoes.\n\n#### Esperantist\n\nTorres Quevedo was also an Esperantist and believed in the importance of a universal language. He was a member of the Esperanto movement and wrote several articles on the subject.\n\n#### Spanish-American Technological Dictionary\n\nTorres Quevedo edited the Spanish-American Technological Dictionary, which was a comprehensive dictionary of technical terms used in engineering and technology.\n\nDistinctions\n------------\n\nTorres Quevedo received numerous distinctions and awards for his work, including the Grand Cross of the Order of Alfonso XII and the Grand Cross of the Order of Isabel la Católica.\n\nPersonal life, religious beliefs and death\n-----------------------------------------\n\nTorres Quevedo was a devout Catholic and believed in the importance of faith and reason. He was married to Doña Sofía Bühler and had five children. He died on December 18, 1936, at the age of 83, in Madrid, Spain.\n\nLegacy\n--------\n\nTorres Quevedo's legacy is immense, and his work had a significant impact on the development of automation, analogue computing, and robotics. He is considered one of the most important Spanish scientists of the 20th century, and his inventions and machines are still studied and admired today.\n\nIn fiction\n----------\n\nTorres Quevedo has been the subject of several works of fiction, including a novel by the Spanish writer, Miguel de Unamuno.\n\nSelected works\n--------------\n\n* \"Essays on Automatics\" (1914)\n* \"The Aritmómetro\" (1900)\n* \"The Telekino\" (1903)\n* \"El Ajedrecista\" (1912)\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Automation\n* Analogue computing\n* Robotics\n* Remote control\n* Chess automaton\n* Formal language\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n### Notes\n\n### Bibliography\n\nExternal links\n---------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Leonardo_Torres_Quevedo\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and education\n#Career\n##Cableways\n##Analogue calculating machines\n##Aerostatics\n##Radio control: the Telekino\n##Formal language\n##Laboratory of Automation\n##Chess automaton: El Ajedrecista\n##Essays on Automatics\n###Analytical machines\n##Naval projects\n##Other inventions and miscellaneous activities\n###Esperantist\n###Spanish-American Technological Dictionary\n#Distinctions\n#Personal life, religious beliefs and death\n#Legacy\n#In fiction\n#Selected works\n#See also\n#References\n##Notes\n##Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is a unique and fascinating area that has drawn the attention of anthropologists, historians, and adventurers alike. The valley is home to the Brokpa people, an indigenous community that has maintained their distinct culture and traditions despite being surrounded by the influences of the outside world.\n\nGeography and Economy\n---------------------\n\nThe Aryan Valley is situated in the Kargil district of Ladakh, approximately 160 kilometers (100 miles) east of the town of Kargil. The valley is nestled in the Himalayas, surrounded by towering mountains that rise to an altitude of over 6,000 meters (20,000 feet). The valley itself is at an elevation of around 3,500 meters (11,500 feet) above sea level.\n\nThe valley is relatively small, stretching for about 30 kilometers (19 miles) in length and 10 kilometers (6 miles) in width. The terrain is rugged, with steep cliffs and rocky outcrops, and the soil is thin and infertile. Despite these challenges, the Brokpa people have developed a unique system of agriculture that allows them to cultivate the land and raise livestock.\n\nThe economy of the Aryan Valley is primarily based on subsistence farming and animal husbandry. The Brokpa people grow crops such as barley, wheat, and potatoes, and raise animals such as yaks, goats, and sheep. The valley is also rich in mineral resources, including copper, zinc, and lead, which have been mined in the past.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\nThe history of the Aryan Valley is shrouded in mystery, and there is much debate about the origins of the Brokpa people. However, it is believed that the valley has been inhabited for thousands of years, with archaeological evidence suggesting that humans were present in the area as far back as the Neolithic period.\n\n### Brokpas\n\nThe Brokpa people are an indigenous community that has lived in the Aryan Valley for centuries. They are believed to be descended from the ancient Aryans, who migrated to the Indian subcontinent from Central Asia around 1500 BCE. The Brokpa people have maintained their distinct culture and traditions, despite being surrounded by the influences of the outside world.\n\nThe Brokpa people are known for their unique customs and practices, which are influenced by their Buddhist and animist traditions. They are skilled farmers and herders, and have developed a deep understanding of the natural world. The Brokpa people are also known for their expertise in medicine, and have developed a range of treatments using local herbs and plants.\n\n### Aryan Association and Neologism\n\nThe term \"Aryan\" has become associated with the valley and its people, due to the valley's name and the supposed origins of the Brokpa people. However, this term is also associated with the Indo-Aryan migration theory, which suggests that the Indian subcontinent was invaded by Indo-European speakers from Central Asia around 1500 BCE.\n\nThis theory has been widely criticized, and many scholars argue that the term \"Aryan\" is a neologism that has been imposed on the Brokpa people by outsiders. The Brokpa people themselves do not identify as \"Aryans\", and instead refer to themselves as \"Brokpa\" or \"Minaro\".\n\nSee Also\n--------\n\n* Ladakh\n* Kargil\n* Brokpa people\n* Himalayas\n* Indo-Aryan migration theory\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nThis article is a general overview of the Aryan Valley and its people.

The monastery was founded in the 12th century and has played a significant role in the country's spiritual and cultural heritage. Over the centuries, the monastery has undergone numerous transformations, including destruction and rebuilding, and has been an important center of worship, learning, and art.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\n### Early years\n\nThe monastery was founded in 1108-1113 by Sviatopolk II Iziaslavich, the Grand Prince of Kiev, on the site of a pre-Christian pagan temple. The original structure was a small wooden church dedicated to the Archangel Michael, which was later replaced by a stone building. The monastery's location on the right bank of the Dnieper River made it an important center of trade and commerce.\n\n### 16th–17th centuries\n\nDuring the 16th and 17th centuries, the monastery underwent significant changes. In 1496, the monastery was granted the status of a lavra, the highest rank of Orthodox monasteries. The monastery's main church, the Cathedral of the Archangel Michael, was rebuilt in the 16th century in the Ukrainian Baroque style. The monastery also became a center of learning and culture, with a scriptorium and a school.\n\n### 18th century\n\nIn the 18th century, the monastery underwent significant renovations. The monastery's main church was rebuilt in the Russian Baroque style, and a new bell tower was constructed. The monastery also became a center of charitable work, with a hospital, an orphanage, and a school for poor children.\n\n### 19th century\n\nDuring the 19th century, the monastery continued to thrive. The monastery's main church was renovated, and a new refectory was built. The monastery also became a center of pilgrimage, with thousands of visitors each year.\n\n### 20th century\n\nThe 20th century was a time of significant turmoil for the monastery. During the Russian Revolution, the monastery was nationalized, and many of its valuables were confiscated. In 1929, the monastery was closed, and many of its monks were arrested or forced to flee.\n\n### Demolition and aftermath\n\nIn 1934, the monastery was demolished by the Soviet authorities, who saw it as a symbol of the old regime. The monastery's main church was blown up, and many of its buildings were destroyed. The site of the monastery was used for a variety of purposes, including a park and a stadium.\n\n### Restoration\n\nIn the 1990s, the Ukrainian government began to restore the monastery. The restoration process was slow and difficult, but it ultimately resulted in the rebuilding of the monastery's main church and many of its other buildings.\n\n#### Plans and preparatory work\n\nThe restoration process began with a detailed plan and preparatory work. Architects and historians studied the monastery's original designs and layouts, and a plan was developed to rebuild the monastery in its original form.\n\n#### Rebuilding the monastery\n\nThe rebuilding process began in 1995 and took several years to complete. The monastery's main church was rebuilt using traditional techniques and materials, including stone and wood. The church's exterior was designed to match its original appearance, with a golden dome and intricate stone carvings.\n\n#### Metropolitan see\n\nIn 1999, the monastery was designated as the metropolitan see of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church. The monastery's main church was consecrated, and a new metropolitan was appointed.\n\nArchitecture\n------------\n\n### Dates, styles and architects\n\nThe monastery's architecture reflects its complex history. The original church was built in the 12th century in the Kievan Rus' style. The monastery's main church was rebuilt in the 16th century in the Ukrainian Baroque style, and again in the 18th century in the Russian Baroque style. The monastery's current main church was rebuilt in the 1990s in the traditional Ukrainian style.\n\n### Cathedral (11th–20th century structure)\n\nThe monastery's main church, the Cathedral of the Archangel Michael, was originally built in the 11th century. The church was rebuilt several times, with significant changes in the 16th and 18th centuries. The church's original design was in the Kievan Rus' style, with a single dome and a simple exterior. The church was rebuilt in the 16th century in the Ukrainian Baroque style, with a larger dome and more intricate stone carvings. The church was rebuilt again in the 18th century in the Russian Baroque style, with a larger dome and more elaborate decorations.\n\n### Rebuilt cathedral\n\nThe monastery's current main church was rebuilt in the 1990s using traditional techniques and materials.

This phenomenon has occurred throughout history, often as a result of war, revolution, or occupation. In this article, we will explore four notable examples of embassies without governments: Russia (1917–1925), Spain (1939–1977), Poland (1939–1990), and Afghanistan (2021–present).\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### Russia (1917–1925)\n\n#### Diplomatic missions after 1917\n\nFollowing the Russian Revolution of 1917, the Bolsheviks seized power, and the Russian Empire was dissolved. The Soviet government, led by Vladimir Lenin, initially maintained diplomatic relations with other countries, but these relations were soon severed due to the Soviet Union's radical policies and the subsequent Russian Civil War. Despite the absence of a recognized government, Russian diplomatic missions abroad continued to operate, often in a state of limbo.\n\nMany Russian diplomats remained loyal to the deposed Romanov dynasty or the anti-Bolshevik White movement, while others sympathized with the Soviet government. This led to a complex situation, with multiple rival diplomatic missions claiming to represent Russia. The most notable example was the Russian Embassy in Paris, which continued to operate under the auspices of the former imperial government.\n\n#### Dissolution of the Soviet Union\n\nIn 1925, the Soviet Union officially recognized the Russian Empire's pre-revolutionary debts and established diplomatic relations with France, marking the beginning of the end of the Russian Embassy without a government. The embassy was eventually dissolved, and its functions were transferred to the Soviet diplomatic mission.\n\n### Spain (1939–1977)\n\n#### Diplomatic missions after 1939\n\nThe Spanish Civil War (1936–1939) ended with the victory of the Nationalist forces led by General Francisco Franco, who established a fascist dictatorship. The Republican government, which had been recognized by the international community, was forced into exile. Despite the absence of a recognized government, many Spanish diplomatic missions abroad continued to operate, often with the support of local authorities.\n\nThe Spanish Embassy in Mexico, for example, remained loyal to the Republican government and continued to issue passports and provide consular services to Spanish citizens. This led to a situation where there were two rival Spanish diplomatic missions: the official Francoist mission and the Republican mission in exile.\n\n### Poland (1939–1990)\n\n#### Diplomatic missions after 1939\n\nDuring World War II, Poland was invaded and occupied by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. The Polish government-in-exile, led by President Władysław Raczkiewicz, established diplomatic relations with the Allied powers and maintained a network of diplomatic missions abroad.\n\nDespite the establishment of a communist government in Poland after the war, many Polish diplomatic missions continued to operate under the auspices of the government-in-exile. The Polish Embassy in London, for example, remained a focal point for the Polish diaspora and continued to issue passports and provide consular services.\n\n### Afghanistan (2021–present)\n\n#### Diplomatic missions after 2021\n\nIn August 2021, the Taliban seized power in Afghanistan, leading to the collapse of the internationally recognized government. Many Afghan diplomatic missions abroad continued to operate, often with the support of local authorities.\n\nThe Afghan Embassy in Washington, D.C., for example, remained open and continued to provide consular services to Afghan citizens. However, the embassy's status remains uncertain, as the Taliban government has not been recognized by the international community.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Diplomatic mission\n* Government-in-exile\n* International recognition\n* Recognition of states\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nThis article is a factual account of the phenomenon of embassies without governments.

The exchange gained popularity due to its innovative products, such as perpetual swaps and options, and its user-friendly interface. FTX was headquartered in the Bahamas and was known for its high liquidity and low fees. However, in November 2022, the exchange faced a severe crisis that led to its bankruptcy and had far-reaching consequences for the cryptocurrency market.\n\n# History\n\nFTX was founded in April 2019 by Sam Bankman-Fried, a former trader at Jane Street, and Gary Wang, a former Google engineer. The exchange was initially based in Hong Kong but later moved to the Bahamas. FTX quickly gained popularity due to its innovative products, such as perpetual swaps and options, and its user-friendly interface. The exchange also introduced a token called FTT, which was used to facilitate transactions and provide discounts to users.\n\nIn 2020, FTX raised $8 million in funding from investors, including Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange. The funding round was led by Binance Labs, the venture arm of Binance. FTX used the funding to expand its operations and develop new products.\n\nIn 2021, FTX raised an additional $900 million in funding from investors, including Sequoia Capital, SoftBank, and Ribbit Capital. The funding round valued FTX at $18 billion, making it one of the most valuable cryptocurrency companies in the world.\n\n# November 2022 crisis and bankruptcy\n\n## Background: FTX and Alameda, Binance, and CoinDesk report\n\nIn November 2022, a report by CoinDesk revealed that Alameda Research, a trading firm founded by Sam Bankman-Fried, had a significant portion of its balance sheet tied up in FTT, the token issued by FTX. The report raised concerns about the solvency of Alameda and the potential risks to FTX.\n\nOn November 6, 2022, Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, announced that it would sell its entire stake in FTX, citing \"recent revelations that have come to light.\" The move was seen as a significant blow to FTX, as Binance was one of its largest investors and had provided significant liquidity to the exchange.\n\n## Crisis begins: Binance FTT sale, sell-off, and withdrawn rescue bid\n\nOn November 7, 2022, Binance began selling its stake in FTX, which led to a sharp decline in the price of FTT. The sell-off triggered a wave of withdrawals from FTX, as users became increasingly concerned about the solvency of the exchange.\n\nOn November 8, 2022, FTX announced that it had reached a deal with Binance to be acquired by the larger exchange. However, the deal was contingent on due diligence, and Binance ultimately withdrew its offer on November 9, 2022, citing concerns about FTX's financials.\n\n## Bankruptcy and unauthorized transactions\n\nOn November 11, 2022, FTX filed for bankruptcy in the United States, citing liabilities of up to $10 billion. The bankruptcy filing revealed that FTX had engaged in a series of unauthorized transactions, including lending billions of dollars of user funds to Alameda Research.\n\nThe bankruptcy filing also revealed that FTX had used user funds to purchase real estate and other assets, including a $16 million property in the Bahamas. The use of user funds for such purposes was widely seen as a breach of trust and a serious violation of regulatory requirements.\n\n## Widening impact and contagion fears\n\nThe collapse of FTX had far-reaching consequences for the cryptocurrency market, with many exchanges and trading firms facing significant losses. The price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies plummeted, as investors became increasingly risk-averse.\n\nThe collapse of FTX also raised concerns about the stability of the entire cryptocurrency market, with many analysts warning of potential contagion effects. The collapse of other exchanges and trading firms was seen as a possibility, and regulators began to take a closer look at the industry.\n\n## Responses and effects\n\n### Effects on investors\n\nThe collapse of FTX had a devastating impact on investors, with many losing significant portions of their portfolios. The collapse also raised concerns about the safety of user funds on other exchanges, with many investors withdrawing their funds or seeking alternative platforms.\n\n### Effects on other cryptocurrency firms and cryptocurrency markets\n\nThe collapse of FTX had a significant impact on other cryptocurrency firms, with many facing significant losses.

The siege was one of the most devastating urban battles in modern history, resulting in significant loss of life, widespread destruction, and a severe humanitarian crisis.\n\n#Background\nMariupol is a strategic port city located on the Sea of Azov, in the Donetsk Oblast of Ukraine. The city has a population of approximately 450,000 people and is a major industrial and economic hub. Prior to the 2022 Russian invasion, Mariupol was under the control of the Ukrainian government, with the city serving as a crucial supply route for the Ukrainian military.\n\nThe conflict in eastern Ukraine began in 2014, following the annexation of Crimea by Russia. Pro-Russian separatists, backed by Russian forces, established the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) and Luhansk People's Republic (LPR), which have been recognized by Russia as independent states. Mariupol, being a key city in the region, has been a focal point of the conflict.\n\n#Advances to Mariupol\n##Preliminary shelling and advance on the city\nOn February 24, 2022, Russian forces launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, with Mariupol being one of the primary targets. Russian artillery and rocket systems began shelling the city, targeting residential areas, hospitals, and critical infrastructure. The initial assault was aimed at weakening Ukrainian defenses and creating an opportunity for Russian ground forces to advance.\n\n##Mariupol surrounded\nBy February 26, Russian forces had encircled Mariupol, cutting off all major roads and supply routes. The city was effectively under siege, with Ukrainian forces and civilians trapped inside. The Russian military continued to pound the city with artillery and aerial bombardments, causing widespread destruction and civilian casualties.\n\n#Urban advances\n##Russian push into the city\nOn March 1, Russian ground forces began their push into Mariupol, attempting to breach Ukrainian defenses. The urban fighting was intense, with both sides suffering significant losses. Russian forces made slow gains, gradually securing key districts and infrastructure.\n\n##Final pockets of resistance\nDespite being vastly outnumbered and outgunned, Ukrainian forces continued to resist, employing guerrilla tactics and ambushes to harass Russian troops. As the siege dragged on, Ukrainian forces became increasingly fragmented, with isolated pockets of resistance holding out in various parts of the city.\n\n#Resistance in the Azovstal steel plant\n##Withdrawal to Azovstal\nAs Russian forces closed in on the city center, Ukrainian forces and civilians retreated to the Azovstal steel plant, a vast industrial complex on the outskirts of Mariupol. The plant, with its extensive underground tunnels and bunkers, provided a secure location for Ukrainian forces to regroup and plan their next move.\n\n##Siege of Azovstal\nRussian forces, aware of the strategic importance of Azovstal, launched a concerted effort to capture the plant. Ukrainian forces, however, held firm, employing a combination of artillery, sniper fire, and sabotage to repel Russian attacks.\n\n##Evacuation of civilians\nAs the siege of Azovstal intensified, humanitarian organizations and Ukrainian authorities worked to evacuate civilians trapped inside the plant. On May 7, a convoy of buses, escorted by United Nations and International Committee of the Red Cross personnel, successfully evacuated over 100 civilians from the plant.\n\n##Ukrainian surrender\nOn May 20, after weeks of brutal fighting, Ukrainian forces at Azovstal surrendered to Russian troops. The capture of the plant marked the end of organized Ukrainian resistance in Mariupol, with Russian forces securing control of the city.\n\n#Aftermath\n##Demolition of buildings and Russification of the city\nFollowing the capture of Mariupol, Russian forces began a systematic campaign to demolish or renovate buildings, erasing Ukrainian cultural and historical symbols. The city's streets were renamed, and Russian language and culture were imposed on the local population.\n\n##Last Ukrainian holdouts and prisoners of war\nAs Russian forces secured control of Mariupol, they began to round up Ukrainian soldiers and civilians suspected of collaboration with Ukrainian forces. Many were taken prisoner, with some facing trial and imprisonment.\n\n##City government's role\nThe city government, now under Russian control, played a crucial role in implementing Russian policies and suppressing Ukrainian identity. Local officials were either coerced or replaced with pro-Russian appointees.\n\n##Claimed cholera outbreak\nIn June 2022, Ukrainian authorities reported a cholera outbreak in Mariupol, claiming that Russian forces had failed to provide adequate sanitation and medical care to the local population. Russian officials denied the allegations, accusing Ukraine of spreading propaganda.\n\n##Ukrainian missile strikes\nIn response to the capture of Mariupol, Ukrainian forces launched a series of missile strikes against Russian positions in the city. The attacks caused significant damage and casualties, with Russian forces struggling to maintain control.\n\n#Casualties\n##Military casualties\nEstimates of military casualties vary widely, with both sides suffering significant losses. Ukrainian forces lost hundreds of soldiers, while Russian forces suffered an estimated 1,000 to 2,000 casualties.\n\n##Civilian casualties\nThe humanitarian toll of the siege was devastating, with thousands of civilians killed or injured. The exact number of civilian casualties remains unknown, but estimates range from 2,000 to 5,000.\n\n#Humanitarian situation\nThe siege of Mari", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Siege_of_Mariupol\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Advances to Mariupol\n##Preliminary shelling and advance on the city\n##Mariupol surrounded\n#Urban advances\n##Russian push into the city\n##Final pockets of resistance\n#Resistance in the Azovstal steel plant\n##Withdrawal to Azovstal\n##Siege of Azovstal\n##Evacuation of civilians\n##Ukrainian surrender\n#Aftermath\n##Demolition of buildings and Russification of the city\n##Last Ukrainian holdouts and prisoners of war\n##City government's role\n##Claimed cholera outbreak\n##Ukrainian missile strikes\n#Casualties\n##Military casualties\n##Civilian casualties\n#Humanitarian situation\n#War crimes committed by Russian forces\n##Shooting of evacuation checkpoints\n##Maternity and children's hospital bombing\n##Regional theatre bombing\n##Mass shelling of residential areas\n##Alleged use of chemical weapons\n#Media coverage\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He is best known for being the first Englishman to circumnavigate the globe and for his role in the defeat of the Spanish Armada. Drake's exploits made him a hero in England, but his privateering activities also made him a pirate in the eyes of the Spanish.\n\n#Birth and early years\n\nFrancis Drake was born around 1540 in Tavistock, Devon, England. His father, Edmund Drake, was a tenant farmer and a Protestant. The family later moved to Kent, where Drake's father became a church deacon. Drake's early education is not well documented, but it is believed that he attended a local school in Kent.\n\n#Early career at sea\n\nDrake began his maritime career at a young age, possibly around 1560. He started as an apprentice on a merchant ship, and over the years, he gained experience and skills as a sailor and navigator.\n\n##Slave trade\n\nIn the early 1560s, Drake became involved in the slave trade, sailing to Africa and the Caribbean. He worked for his cousin, Sir John Hawkins, who was a prominent slave trader. During this period, Drake developed skills as a navigator and learned about the Spanish Main, which would later become important in his privateering activities.\n\n##Expedition of 1572–1573\n\nIn 1572, Drake and his cousin John Hawkins organized an expedition to the Caribbean. The expedition was intended to attack Spanish ships and colonies, but it ended in disaster when the Spanish attacked their fleet. Drake and Hawkins escaped, but many of their men were killed or captured.\n\n##Rathlin Island massacre\n\nIn 1575, Drake participated in the Rathlin Island massacre, in which hundreds of Scottish and Irish villagers were killed by English forces. Drake was part of a privateering expedition led by John Norreys, who was seeking to capture the island from the Scottish.\n\n#Circumnavigation (1577–1580)\n\nDrake's most famous voyage was his circumnavigation of the globe, which took place from 1577 to 1580. The voyage was sponsored by Queen Elizabeth I and was intended to disrupt Spanish shipping and colonies in the Pacific.\n\n##Execution of Thomas Doughty\n\nIn 1578, Drake had Thomas Doughty, one of his officers, executed for mutiny. The execution took place on the island of Puerto San Julián in what is now Argentina. Doughty had been accused of plotting against Drake, and his execution was seen as a way to maintain discipline on the ship.\n\n##Entering the Pacific (1578)\n\nIn September 1578, Drake's ship, the Golden Hind, entered the Pacific Ocean through the Strait of Magellan. This was the first time an English ship had sailed through the strait.\n\n##Raids on Spanish American west coast\n\nDrake's ship sailed along the Spanish American west coast, raiding towns and ships. He captured several Spanish ships, including the Nuestra Señora de la Victoria, which was carrying a large cargo of gold and silver.\n\n##Coast of California: Nova Albion (1579)\n\nIn June 1579, Drake sailed up the coast of California and claimed the land for England, naming it Nova Albion. He and his men spent several weeks in the area, repairing their ship and interacting with the local Native American tribes.\n\n##Across the Pacific and around Africa\n\nAfter leaving California, Drake's ship sailed across the Pacific and around Africa, returning to England in 1580. The voyage was a major achievement, as Drake had become the first Englishman to circumnavigate the globe.\n\n##Return to Plymouth (1580)\n\nDrake returned to Plymouth in September 1580, where he was greeted as a hero. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth I, who was impressed by his achievements.\n\n##Knighthood and arms\n\nDrake was granted a coat of arms, which featured a wyvern (a mythical creature) and the motto \"Sic Parvis Magna\" (\"Thus great things from small beginnings\").\n\n#Political career\n\nDrake became involved in politics after his circumnavigation. He was elected as a member of parliament for Plymouth in 1584 and served on several committees.\n\n#Great Expedition to America\n\nIn 1585, Drake led an expedition to the Caribbean, which was intended to attack Spanish colonies and shipping. The expedition was successful, and Drake captured several Spanish ships and towns.\n\n#Conflict with the Spanish Armada\n\nDrake played a major role in the conflict with the Spanish Armada, which took place in 1588. The Armada was a large fleet of Spanish ships that was sent to invade England.\n\n##Cádiz raid\n\nIn 1587, Drake led a raid on the Spanish port of Cádiz, where he sank several Spanish ships and destroyed much of the port.\n\n##Defeat of the Spanish Armada\n\nIn 1588, Drake played a key role in the defeat of the Spanish Armada. He was one of the leaders of the English fleet, which was much smaller than the Spanish fleet. However, the English ships were more maneuverable, and they were able to use their superior gunnery to defeat the Spanish.\n\n##English Armada\n\nIn 1589, Drake led an expedition to Spain, which was intended to destroy the Spanish fleet and capture the city of Lisbon. The expedition was unsuccessful, and Drake's ship was forced to retreat.\n\n#Defeats and death\n\nDrake's later years were marked by several defeats and failures. He was defeated by the Spanish in several battles, and he was eventually forced to retreat to England.\n\nDrake died on January 28, 1596, off the coast of Panama. He was buried at sea, and his body was later lost.\n\n#Family and heritage\n\nDrake married twice, first to Mary Newman and then to Elizabeth Sydenham. He had no children, but he had several nieces and nephews who inherited his property and title.\n\n#Legacy and honours\n\nDrake's legacy is still celebrated today. He is remembered as a hero and a pioneer, and his exploits have inspired countless books, films, and other works of art.\n\n##Geographical names\n\nSeveral geographical features have been named after Drake, including Drake's Passage, which is a strait at the tip of South America, and Drake Bay, which is a bay in California.\n\n#See also\n\n* List of circumnavigations\n* Spanish Armada\n* English Armada\n* Privateering\n\n#References\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements.)\n\n#Bibliography\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements.)\n\n#External links\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements.)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Francis_Drake\" following this outline:\n\n#Birth and early years\n#Early career at sea\n##Slave trade\n##Expedition of 1572–1573\n##Rathlin Island massacre\n#Circumnavigation (1577–1580)\n##Execution of Thomas Doughty\n##Entering the Pacific (1578)\n##Raids on Spanish American west coast\n##Coast of California: Nova Albion (1579)\n##Across the Pacific and around Africa\n##Return to Plymouth (1580)\n##Knighthood and arms\n#Political career\n#Great Expedition to America\n#Conflict with the Spanish Armada\n##Cádiz raid\n##Defeat of the Spanish Armada\n##English Armada\n#Defeats and death\n#Family and heritage\n#Legacy and honours\n##Geographical names\n#See also\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The incident began in November 2022, when Biden's lawyers discovered a batch of classified documents from his time as Vice President at his think tank in Washington, D.C. Subsequent searches revealed additional classified documents at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, and other locations.\n\n# Background\n\nAs Vice President from 2009 to 2017, Biden had access to classified information as part of his duties. After leaving office, he established the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement, a think tank affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania. The center was housed in a Washington, D.C. office building, where Biden maintained an office. In November 2022, Biden's lawyers began a review of the documents stored at the center, ahead of the lease's expiration.\n\n# Discoveries and Other Developments\n\n## First Batch of Documents\n\nOn November 2, 2022, Biden's lawyers discovered a batch of classified documents from his time as Vice President at the Penn Biden Center. The lawyers immediately notified the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), which took custody of the documents. The discovery was not publicly disclosed at the time.\n\n## DOJ Letter to Bob Bauer\n\nOn November 4, 2022, the Department of Justice (DOJ) sent a letter to Bob Bauer, Biden's personal attorney, requesting that the President's lawyers not review any further documents at the Penn Biden Center. The DOJ also asked that any additional documents be preserved and turned over to the National Archives.\n\n## Second Batch of Documents\n\nOn December 20, 2022, Biden's lawyers discovered a second batch of classified documents at his home in Wilmington, Delaware. The documents were found in a storage room adjacent to the garage. The lawyers immediately notified the DOJ and NARA, and the documents were taken into custody.\n\n## FBI Search of Biden's Wilmington Home\n\nOn January 20, 2023, the FBI conducted a search of Biden's Wilmington home, with the President's cooperation. The search was part of the ongoing investigation into the classified documents. The FBI found an additional six items with classification markings, which were taken into custody.\n\n## Other Searches\n\nIn addition to the searches at the Penn Biden Center and Biden's Wilmington home, the FBI also conducted searches at the Biden family's vacation home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, and at the University of Delaware, where Biden donated his Senate papers.\n\n# Initial Responses\n\n## Biden and His Legal Team\n\nBiden has maintained that he was unaware of the classified documents and has cooperated fully with the investigation. His lawyers have stated that the documents were \"inadvertently misplaced\" and that they are working to ensure that all classified materials are accounted for.\n\n## Elected Officials\n\n### Republican Elected Officials\n\nRepublican lawmakers have called for transparency and accountability in the investigation, with some demanding that Biden be held to the same standard as former President Donald Trump, who is also under investigation for classified documents.\n\n### Democratic Elected Officials\n\nDemocratic lawmakers have defended Biden, arguing that he has cooperated with the investigation and that the documents were \"inadvertently misplaced.\"\n\n## Media Analysis\n\nThe media has provided extensive coverage of the incident, with some outlets drawing comparisons to the Trump investigation. Analysts have noted that the Biden incident is different, given the President's cooperation and the fact that the documents were discovered and reported by his own lawyers.\n\n## Misinformation\n\nThere have been reports of misinformation and conspiracy theories surrounding the incident, with some claiming that Biden intentionally hid the documents or that the investigation is a \"witch hunt.\"\n\n## Discovery of Classified Documents at Mike Pence's Residence\n\nOn January 24, 2023, it was reported that classified documents had been discovered at the residence of former Vice President Mike Pence. The documents were found by Pence's lawyers, who immediately notified the National Archives. The discovery has raised questions about the handling of classified materials by former government officials.\n\n# Investigations\n\n## Special Counsel\n\nOn January 12, 2023, Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed a special counsel to investigate the Biden classified documents incident. The special counsel, Robert Hur, is a former U.S. Attorney and has extensive experience in handling sensitive investigations.\n\n### Decision That Charges Were Unwarranted\n\nOn September 9, 2023, the special counsel announced that charges were unwarranted in the Biden classified documents incident. The special counsel found that Biden had not intentionally mishandled the documents and that there was no evidence of wrongdoing.\n\n### Comments on Biden's Memory\n\nIn his report, the special counsel noted that Biden's memory had been a subject of concern during the investigation. However, the special counsel found that there was no evidence to suggest that Biden's memory had played a role in the mishandling of the documents.\n\n## Congressional\n\nCongressional committees have also launched investigations into the Biden classified documents incident. The investigations are ongoing, with lawmakers seeking to determine how the documents were mishandled and what steps can be taken to prevent similar incidents in the future.\n\n# See Also\n\n* Classified information in the United States\n* National Archives and Records Administration\n* Department of Justice\n* FBI\n* Presidential records\n* Classified document scandals in the United States", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Joe_Biden_classified_documents_incident\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Discoveries and other developments\n##First batch of documents\n##DOJ letter to Bob Bauer\n##Second batch of documents\n##FBI search of Biden's Wilmington home\n##Other searches\n#Initial responses\n##Biden and his legal team\n##Elected officials\n###Republican elected officials\n###Democratic elected officials\n##Media analysis\n##Misinformation\n##Discovery of classified documents at Mike Pence's residence\n#Investigations\n##Special counsel\n###Decision that charges were unwarranted\n###Comments on Biden's memory\n##Congressional\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The battle took place near the town of Kapyong, located in the Gangwon-do province of South Korea. The conflict involved Australian, Canadian, and New Zealand forces, collectively known as the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (1 RAR), 2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry (2 PPCLI), and the 16th Field Regiment, Royal New Zealand Artillery, against the Chinese People's Volunteer Army (PVA). This article provides an in-depth examination of the battle, including the military situation, the Chinese Spring Offensive, the defense of Hill 504 by the Australian 3 RAR, the last stand on Hill 677 by the Canadian 2 PPCLI, and the aftermath of the battle.\n\n#Background\n\n##Military situation\n\nIn the spring of 1951, the Korean War had reached a stalemate. The United Nations Command (UNC), led by General Matthew Ridgway, had launched a series of operations aimed at pushing the Chinese and North Korean forces back across the 38th parallel. However, the PVA had regrouped and reorganized, and was now preparing to launch a massive counterattack.\n\nThe 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (1 RAR), was part of the 28th British Commonwealth Brigade, which was tasked with defending the Kapyong Valley. The valley was a strategic location, as it controlled the main road and rail link between Seoul and the north. The Australians were supported by the 2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry (2 PPCLI), and the 16th Field Regiment, Royal New Zealand Artillery.\n\n#Chinese Spring Offensive\n\n##Preparations\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the battle, the PVA had been secretly massing troops and supplies in the mountains surrounding the Kapyong Valley. The Chinese had been observing the UNC's defensive positions and had identified several weaknesses, including the lack of coordination between units and the vulnerability of the roads and supply lines.\n\n##Launch of Chinese Spring Offensive\n\nOn April 22, 1951, the PVA launched a massive assault on the UNC's defensive positions, including the 28th British Commonwealth Brigade. The Chinese troops poured into the Kapyong Valley, overwhelming the UNC's forward positions and pushing the defenders back.\n\n##South Korean withdrawal, 22–23 April 1951\n\nAs the Chinese advanced, the South Korean forces, who were positioned on the flanks of the 28th British Commonwealth Brigade, began to withdraw. This exposed the Australians and Canadians to attack from the sides and rear, making their defensive positions even more precarious.\n\n#Australian 3 RAR defence of Hill 504, 23–24 April 1951\n\n##Night battle\n\nOn the night of April 23, the Australian 3 RAR was tasked with defending Hill 504, a strategic location that controlled the main road through the Kapyong Valley. The Australians had established a series of defensive positions on the hill, including machine gun posts and mortar emplacements.\n\nAs the Chinese advanced, the Australians were subjected to a fierce artillery bombardment, followed by a wave of infantry attacks. The Australians held their ground, but the Chinese continued to press the attack, using their superior numbers to try and overwhelm the defenders.\n\n##Day battle\n\nOn the morning of April 24, the Chinese launched a fresh assault on the Australian positions. The Australians were subjected to a withering artillery bombardment, followed by a series of infantry attacks. The Australians held their ground, but the Chinese continued to press the attack, using their superior numbers to try and overwhelm the defenders.\n\n##3 RAR withdraws\n\nAs the day wore on, the Australians began to run low on ammunition and supplies. The Chinese were also starting to make gains on the flanks, threatening to cut off the Australian withdrawal route. In the face of overwhelming odds, the Australians were forced to withdraw from Hill 504, falling back to a new defensive position.\n\n#Canadian 2 PPCLI last stand on Hill 677, 24–25 April 1951\n\n##Preparations\n\nAs the Australians withdrew from Hill 504, the Canadian 2 PPCLI was tasked with defending Hill 677, a strategic location that controlled the main road through the Kapyong Valley. The Canadians had established a series of defensive positions on the hill, including machine gun posts and mortar emplacements.\n\n##Night battle\n\nOn the night of April 24, the Chinese launched a fierce assault on the Canadian positions. The Canadians were subjected to a withering artillery bombardment, followed by a wave of infantry attacks. The Canadians held their ground, but the Chinese continued to press the attack, using their superior numbers to try and overwhelm the defenders.\n\n##Final 2 PPCLI Operations\n\nAs the night wore on, the Canadians began to run low on ammunition and supplies. The Chinese were also starting to make gains on the flanks, threatening to cut off the Canadian withdrawal route. In the face of overwhelming odds, the Canadians were forced to withdraw from Hill 677, falling back to a new defensive position.\n\n#Aftermath\n\n##Summary and casualties\n\nThe Battle of Kapyong was a costly and bloody engagement, with both sides suffering heavy casualties. The UNC lost over 1,000 men killed or wounded, while the PVA lost an estimated 10,000 men.\n\n##Awards\n\nThe bravery and sacrifice of the Australian and Canadian soldiers during the Battle of Kapyong were recognized with the award of several decorations, including the Victoria Cross, the Distinguished Service Order, and the Military Cross.\n\n##Subsequent operations\n\nThe Battle of Kapyong marked a turning point in the Korean War, as the UNC was able to regroup and reorganize following the battle. The UNC launched a series of counterattacks, pushing the PVA back across the 38th parallel and eventually leading to the signing of the Armistice Agreement in July 1953.\n\n#See also\n\n* Korean War\n* Australian military history\n* Canadian military history\n* Battle of Chosin Reservoir\n* Battle of Inchon\n\n#Notes\n\n#References\n\n#Further reading", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Battle_of_Kapyong\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Military situation\n#Chinese Spring Offensive\n##Preparations\n##Launch of Chinese Spring Offensive\n##South Korean withdrawal, 22–23 April 1951\n#Australian 3 RAR defence of Hill 504, 23–24 April 1951\n##Night battle\n##Day battle\n##3 RAR withdraws\n#Canadian 2 PPCLI last stand on Hill 677, 24–25 April 1951\n##Preparations\n##Night battle\n##Final 2 PPCLI Operations\n#Aftermath\n##Summary and casualties\n##Awards\n##Subsequent operations\n#See also\n#Notes\n##Footnotes\n##Citations\n#References\n#Further reading\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

His life and career are a testament to the complex web of relationships between the English crown, the Irish nobility, and the emerging Anglo-Norman aristocracy in Ireland.\n\nBackground\n-----------\n\nJohn Cruys was born into a family of Anglo-Norman descent, likely in the late 13th century. His family had established themselves in Ireland, where they held significant tracts of land and exercised considerable influence. The Cruys family was part of the wider network of Anglo-Norman settlers who had arrived in Ireland in the 12th century, attracted by the promise of land and power.\n\nMerrion Castle and other Cruys holdings\n--------------------------------------\n\nThe Cruys family held a significant portfolio of lands and castles in Ireland, with their primary seat being Merrion Castle, located in what is now County Dublin. Merrion Castle was a strategic stronghold, situated near the coast and controlling access to the surrounding countryside. The castle was likely built by John's ancestors in the 13th century and served as the family's principal residence and power base.\n\nIn addition to Merrion Castle, the Cruys family held lands and castles in other parts of Ireland, including County Kildare and County Wicklow. These holdings were scattered throughout the countryside, reflecting the family's influence and reach across the region.\n\nCareer\n-------\n\nJohn Cruys began his career in the service of the English crown, likely as a young man. He quickly rose through the ranks, demonstrating his administrative skills and earning the trust of his superiors. In 1315, he was appointed as the escheator of Ireland, a position that gave him responsibility for managing the crown's lands and revenues in the country.\n\nAs escheator, Cruys played a crucial role in the governance of Ireland, working closely with the justiciar and other senior officials to maintain order and collect taxes. He was also involved in the administration of justice, serving as a justice of the peace and hearing cases in the royal courts.\n\nThe Verdon inheritance\n----------------------\n\nIn 1317, John Cruys married a member of the powerful Verdon family, securing a significant inheritance for himself and his family. The Verdons were a prominent Anglo-Norman family who had established themselves in Ireland in the 12th century. They held extensive lands and castles, including the strategic stronghold of Castle Roche in County Louth.\n\nThrough his marriage, Cruys gained control of the Verdon lands and castles, significantly expanding his family's influence and power in Ireland. The Verdon inheritance also brought him closer to the English crown, as the Verdons had long been loyal supporters of the monarchy.\n\nLater career\n-------------\n\nIn the 1320s, John Cruys continued to serve the English crown, holding various positions and responsibilities. He was appointed as the constable of Dublin Castle, a key stronghold in the heart of the city, and played a role in the administration of justice, serving as a justice of the peace.\n\nCruys also became increasingly involved in the governance of Ireland, serving as a member of the Irish council and advising the justiciar on matters of state. He was a skilled diplomat and negotiator, able to navigate the complex web of relationships between the English crown, the Irish nobility, and the emerging Anglo-Norman aristocracy.\n\nFamily\n-------\n\nJohn Cruys married a member of the Verdon family, securing a significant inheritance for himself and his family. The couple had children, although little is known about their lives and careers. The Cruys family continued to play a significant role in the governance of Ireland, with later generations serving as administrators, justices, and military leaders.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland\n* History of Ireland (1169–1536)\n* List of castles in Ireland\n* Merrion Castle\n\nSources\n--------\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"John_Cruys\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Merrion Castle and other Cruys holdings\n#Career\n#The Verdon inheritance\n#Later career\n#Family\n#See also\n#Sources\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
