He is best known for his philosophical treatise, \"De consolatione philosophiae\" (\"The Consolation of Philosophy\"), which became one of the most popular and influential works of the Middle Ages.\n\nEarly life\n-----------\n\nBoethius was born in Rome around 480 AD, into a noble family of senatorial rank. His father, Flavius Manlius Boethius, was a consul in 487 AD, and his mother was from the noble family of the Anicii. After his father's death, Boethius was adopted by Quintus Aurelius Memmius Symmachus, a wealthy and influential senator.\n\nBoethius was educated in the traditional Roman manner, studying Greek and Roman literature, philosophy, and rhetoric. He was particularly drawn to the works of Aristotle and Plato, and his later writings reflect the influence of these philosophers.\n\nRise to power\n--------------\n\nBoethius' intellectual talents and family connections quickly propelled him to prominence in Roman society. In 510 AD, he became a consul, one of the highest offices in the Roman Empire. He served under the Ostrogothic king, Theodoric the Great, who had conquered Italy in 493 AD.\n\nBoethius' rise to power was not limited to politics. He was also a renowned scholar and philosopher, and his writings on logic, mathematics, and philosophy earned him widespread recognition. He was particularly admired for his translations of Aristotle's works into Latin, which helped to introduce Greek philosophy to a wider audience.\n\nDownfall and death\n-----------------\n\nBoethius' success was short-lived. In 523 AD, he was accused of treason against Theodoric the Great, allegedly for conspiring with the Eastern Roman Emperor, Justin I. Theodoric, who was an Arian Christian, may have been suspicious of Boethius' orthodox Christian views.\n\nBoethius was imprisoned in Pavia, where he wrote his most famous work, \"De consolatione philosophiae\". He was eventually executed in 524 AD, possibly by beheading.\n\nMajor works\n------------\n\nBoethius' writings cover a wide range of subjects, including philosophy, theology, mathematics, and music.\n\n### De consolatione philosophiae\n\n\"The Consolation of Philosophy\" is Boethius' most famous work, written while he was in prison awaiting execution. The book is a dialogue between Boethius and the personification of Philosophy, who consoles him on the nature of evil, fortune, and the human condition.\n\nThe work is divided into five books, each exploring a different theme. Book I deals with the nature of fortune and the fleeting nature of human happiness. Book II examines the nature of evil and the problem of evil. Book III considers the nature of good and the highest good. Book IV explores the nature of happiness and the human condition. Book V discusses the nature of fate and providence.\n\n### De topicis differentiis\n\n\"On Topical Differentiae\" is a treatise on logic and argumentation, in which Boethius explores the nature of topics and differentiae. The work is a commentary on Aristotle's \"Topics\", and provides a detailed analysis of the different types of arguments and their uses.\n\n### De arithmetica\n\n\"On Arithmetic\" is a treatise on mathematics, in which Boethius provides an introduction to the principles of arithmetic. The work is based on the Greek mathematician Nicomachus' \"Introduction to Arithmetic\", and provides a detailed analysis of the nature of numbers and their properties.\n\n### De institutione musica\n\n\"On the Institution of Music\" is a treatise on music theory, in which Boethius explores the nature of music and its relationship to the human soul. The work is based on the Greek music theorist Pythagoras' teachings, and provides a detailed analysis of the different types of music and their effects on the human emotions.\n\n### Opuscula sacra\n\n\"The Sacred Tracts\" are a collection of five theological treatises, in which Boethius explores the nature of the Trinity, the Incarnation, and the person of Christ. The works are written in a formal, scholastic style, and provide a detailed analysis of the different theological positions on these topics.\n\nDates of works\n--------------\n\nThe exact dates of Boethius' works are not certain, but they can be broadly dated to the following periods:\n\n* \"De consolatione philosophiae\": 523-524 AD\n* \"De topicis differentiis\": 510-520 AD\n* \"De arithmetica\": 500-510 AD\n* \"De institutione musica\": 500-510 AD\n* \"Opuscula sacra\": 520-523 AD\n\nLegacy\n--------\n\nBoethius' writings had a profound impact on Western philosophy and theology. His translations of Aristotle's works helped to introduce Greek philosophy to a wider audience, and his own writings on logic, mathematics, and philosophy helped to establish the foundations of medieval scholasticism.\n\nBoethius' \"De consolatione philosophiae\" became one of the most popular and influential works of the Middle Ages, and was widely read and studied by scholars and theologians. The work's themes of fortune, evil, and the human condition continue to be relevant today, and its influence can be seen in the works of later philosophers and theologians, such as Thomas Aquinas and Dante Alighieri.\n\nVeneration\n------------\n\nBoethius was venerated as a saint by the Catholic Church, and his feast day is celebrated on October 23. He is also recognized as a martyr by the Orthodox Church, and his feast day is celebrated on October 23.\n\nIn popular culture\n-------------------\n\nBoethius' \"De consolatione philosophiae\" has been widely referenced and alluded to in popular culture. The work's themes of fortune, evil, and the human condition have been explored in literature, art, and music, and its influence can be seen in the works of later writers and thinkers.\n\nSee also\n----------\n\n* Ancient Roman philosophy\n* Medieval philosophy\n* Scholasticism\n* Aristotelianism\n* Platonism\n\nNotes\n------\n\nThis article is based on the available sources and provides a general overview of Boethius' life and works.

Developed by the company OpenAI, ChatGPT was first released to the public in November 2022 and has since gained widespread attention and interest. The program uses a type of machine learning algorithm called a transformer to process and respond to user input, generating human-like text based on patterns and relationships learned from large datasets.\n\nTraining\n--------\n\nChatGPT was trained on a massive corpus of text data, which includes a wide range of sources from the internet, books, and other digital content. The training process involves feeding this data into the model and adjusting its parameters to optimize its performance on a variety of tasks, such as answering questions, completing sentences, and generating text. The model's training data is sourced from various places, including but not limited to, the internet, books, and user-generated content.\n\nThe training process for ChatGPT is a complex and time-consuming task that requires significant computational resources and expertise. The model's developers use a range of techniques, including masked language modeling and next sentence prediction, to train the model and fine-tune its performance. The resulting model is capable of generating human-like text that is coherent, context-dependent, and engaging.\n\nFeatures and limitations\n------------------------\n\n### Features\n\nChatGPT has a range of features that make it a powerful tool for a variety of applications. Some of the key features of ChatGPT include:\n\n* **Conversational interface**: ChatGPT has a conversational interface that allows users to interact with the model in a natural and intuitive way.\n* **Contextual understanding**: ChatGPT has the ability to understand context and respond accordingly, making it a powerful tool for applications such as customer service and language translation.\n* **Knowledge base**: ChatGPT has a massive knowledge base that it can draw upon to answer questions and provide information on a wide range of topics.\n* **Creative writing**: ChatGPT has the ability to generate creative writing, such as stories and poems, making it a useful tool for writers and artists.\n\n### Limitations\n\nDespite its many features and capabilities, ChatGPT has a number of limitations that are important to consider. Some of the key limitations of ChatGPT include:\n\n* **Limited domain knowledge**: While ChatGPT has a massive knowledge base, its domain knowledge is limited to the data it was trained on, and it may not have the same level of expertise as a human in a particular domain.\n* **Lack of common sense**: ChatGPT may not always have the same level of common sense as a human, and may not be able to understand the nuances of human behavior and culture.\n* **Vulnerability to bias**: ChatGPT may be vulnerable to bias, as it is trained on data that may reflect the biases and prejudices of its creators.\n\n#### Jailbreaking\n\nChatGPT has been shown to be vulnerable to \"jailbreaking,\" a technique where a user provides a carefully crafted input that causes the model to produce a response that is not in line with its intended behavior. This can be a concern for applications such as customer service, where the model may be used to provide critical information to users.\n\nService\n--------\n\n### ChatGPT Plus\n\nChatGPT Plus is a paid version of the ChatGPT service that offers additional features and capabilities, including:\n\n* **Priority access**: ChatGPT Plus users get priority access to the model, which means they can use it even when it is busy or unavailable to other users.\n* **Additional features**: ChatGPT Plus users get access to additional features, such as the ability to use the model for commercial purposes and to access its API.\n* **Dedicated support**: ChatGPT Plus users get dedicated support from the OpenAI team, which means they can get help and answers to their questions more quickly.\n\n### Mobile app\n\nChatGPT has a mobile app that allows users to access the model on their mobile devices. The app is available for both iOS and Android devices, and it allows users to interact with the model in a natural and intuitive way.\n\n### Software development support\n\nChatGPT has software development support, which means that developers can use the model's API to integrate it into their own applications and services.

With a population of over 41 million people, Ukraine is the second-largest country in Europe by land area. From its early beginnings as a medieval state to its current status as an independent nation, Ukraine has a complex and fascinating history that has shaped its people and culture.\n\nEtymology and Orthography\n---------------------------\n\nThe name \"Ukraine\" is derived from the Old East Slavic word \"ukraina,\" meaning \"borderland\" or \"edge.\" This name was first used in the 12th century to describe the territory of Kievan Rus', a medieval East Slavic state that was the precursor to modern Ukraine. Over time, the name \"Ukraine\" became associated with the territory of the Ukrainian people, who have a distinct language, culture, and history.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\n### Early History\n\nThe earliest known human habitation in Ukraine dates back to the Paleolithic era, around 40,000 BCE.

The battle centered on the strategic town of Soledar, located in the Donetsk Oblast of eastern Ukraine. The conflict began in early August 2022 and lasted for several months, with both sides suffering significant losses.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nSoledar, a small town in the Donetsk Oblast, has significant strategic importance due to its salt mines and proximity to the city of Bakhmut. The town's capture would provide the Russian military with a crucial foothold in the region and enable them to launch further attacks on Ukrainian positions. The Ukrainian military, on the other hand, was determined to defend the town and prevent Russian advances.\n\nIn the lead-up to the battle, tensions had been escalating between Russian and Ukrainian forces in the region. The Russian military had been launching sporadic attacks on Ukrainian positions, and the Ukrainian military had been responding with force. The situation on the ground was complex, with multiple factions and militias involved in the conflict.\n\nBattle\n------\n\n### Initial Russian advances (3 August – 1 October 2022)\n\nThe battle began on August 3, 2022, when Russian forces launched a surprise attack on Ukrainian positions near Soledar. The Russian military used a combination of artillery, tanks, and infantry to break through Ukrainian lines and capture several key villages. The Ukrainian military responded with force, but was initially unable to stem the Russian advance.\n\nOver the next several weeks, Russian forces continued to push deeper into Ukrainian territory, capturing several key towns and villages. The Ukrainian military was forced to retreat to more defensive positions, where they regrouped and prepared to launch a counterattack.\n\n### Frontline stalls (2 October – 27 December 2022)\n\nBy early October 2022, the frontline had stabilized, with both sides dug in and preparing for a long and bloody conflict. The Russian military continued to launch sporadic attacks, but the Ukrainian military was able to hold its ground.\n\nDespite the stalemate, the conflict continued to escalate, with both sides suffering significant losses. The Russian military was forced to bring in reinforcements, including troops from the Wagner Group, a private military company with ties to the Russian government.\n\nThe Ukrainian military, meanwhile, was able to receive significant support from its Western allies, including the United States and the United Kingdom. The Ukrainian military was able to use this support to launch several successful counterattacks, which helped to slow the Russian advance.\n\n### Russian breakthrough and capture (27 December 2022 – 16 January 2023)\n\nOn December 27, 2022, the Russian military launched a surprise attack on Ukrainian positions near Soledar. The attack was led by troops from the Wagner Group, who were able to break through Ukrainian lines and capture several key villages.\n\nOver the next several weeks, the Russian military continued to push deeper into Ukrainian territory, capturing several key towns and villages. The Ukrainian military was forced to retreat to more defensive positions, where they regrouped and prepared to launch a counterattack.\n\nOn January 16, 2023, the Russian military announced that it had captured the town of Soledar. The Ukrainian military confirmed that it had lost control of the town, but vowed to continue fighting.\n\nCasualties and humanitarian impact\n--------------------------------\n\n### Military casualties\n\nThe battle was extremely bloody, with both sides suffering significant losses. The exact number of casualties is difficult to determine, but it is estimated that several thousand soldiers were killed or wounded on both sides.\n\nThe Russian military suffered significant losses, particularly during the initial advances in August and September 2022. The Ukrainian military also suffered significant losses, particularly during the Russian breakthrough in December 2022.\n\n### Impact on civilians\n\nThe conflict had a significant impact on civilians, particularly those living in the town of Soledar and surrounding areas. Many civilians were forced to flee their homes, and several thousand were trapped in the town during the fighting.\n\nThe conflict also had a significant impact on the local economy, with several key industries, including the salt mines, forced to shut down. The conflict also disrupted key infrastructure, including roads and bridges.\n\nAnalysis\n--------\n\nThe battle was a significant turning point in the conflict, marking a major shift in momentum in favor of the Russian military. The capture of Soledar provided the Russian military with a crucial foothold in the region, and enabled them to launch further attacks on Ukrainian positions.\n\nThe battle also highlighted the significant challenges facing the Ukrainian military, particularly in terms of manpower and resources. The Ukrainian military was forced to rely heavily on Western support, which was not always forthcoming.\n\nThe battle also had significant implications for the wider conflict, particularly in terms of the role of private military companies. The use of the Wagner Group by the Russian military marked a significant shift in the conflict, and raised concerns about the role of private military companies in modern warfare.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* Battle of Bakhmut\n* Wagner Group", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Battle_of_Soledar\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Battle\n##Initial Russian advances (3 August – 1 October 2022)\n##Frontline stalls (2 October – 27 December 2022)\n##Russian breakthrough and capture (27 December 2022 – 16 January 2023)\n#Casualties and humanitarian impact\n##Military casualties\n##Impact on civilians\n#Analysis\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The style is named after Andrea Palladio, a Venetian architect who is widely considered one of the most influential architects in history. Palladian architecture is characterized by its use of classical elements such as columns, arches, and domes, as well as its emphasis on symmetry, proportion, and harmony.\n\n# Palladio's Architecture\n\nAndrea Palladio was born in 1508 in Padua, Italy, and began his career as a stonemason. However, he soon became fascinated with classical architecture and began to study the works of Vitruvius and other ancient Roman architects. In 1541, Palladio traveled to Rome, where he was deeply influenced by the city's classical architecture and began to develop his own unique style.\n\nPalladio's architecture is characterized by its use of classical elements such as columns, arches, and domes. He was particularly interested in the use of the classical orders, which he believed were the key to creating beautiful and harmonious buildings. Palladio's buildings often featured a central block with projecting wings, and he made extensive use of arches and arcades to create a sense of rhythm and harmony.\n\nOne of Palladio's most famous buildings is the Villa Capra, also known as La Rotonda, which was built in the 1560s near Vicenza, Italy. This building is considered one of the greatest examples of Palladian architecture and features a central block with four projecting wings, each of which is topped with a dome. The building is surrounded by a series of arches and arcades, which create a sense of rhythm and harmony.\n\n# Venetian and Palladian Windows\n\nOne of the most distinctive features of Palladian architecture is the use of Venetian and Palladian windows. These windows are characterized by their use of a central arch or semicircle, which is flanked by two smaller rectangular windows. The Venetian window is typically smaller than the Palladian window and features a central arch that is rounded at the top. The Palladian window, on the other hand, features a central arch that is more pointed and is often topped with a keystone.\n\nThe use of Venetian and Palladian windows became a hallmark of Palladian architecture and was widely imitated by other architects. These windows were often used to create a sense of rhythm and harmony on the facade of a building, and were frequently used in conjunction with other classical elements such as columns and arches.\n\n# Early Palladianism\n\nPalladian architecture was widely admired and imitated during the 16th and 17th centuries, and a number of other architects began to develop their own versions of the style. One of the most notable early Palladian architects was Vincenzo Scamozzi, who was a pupil of Palladio and went on to become a prominent architect in his own right.\n\nScamozzi's architecture was heavily influenced by Palladio, and he made extensive use of classical elements such as columns, arches, and domes. However, Scamozzi also developed his own unique style, which was characterized by its use of complex and intricate designs.\n\nAnother notable early Palladian architect was Inigo Jones, who was an English architect who traveled to Italy in the early 17th century and was deeply influenced by Palladio's architecture. Jones went on to become one of the most important architects in England, and his designs for buildings such as the Queen's House in Greenwich and the Banqueting House in Whitehall were heavily influenced by Palladian principles.\n\n# Neo-Palladianism\n\nDuring the 18th century, there was a renewed interest in Palladian architecture, and a number of architects began to develop their own versions of the style. This movement, which became known as Neo-Palladianism, was characterized by its use of classical elements such as columns, arches, and domes, as well as its emphasis on symmetry, proportion, and harmony.\n\nNeo-Palladian architecture was widely popular in Europe and North America during the 18th and 19th centuries, and a number of notable architects contributed to the style. One of the most notable Neo-Palladian architects was Robert Adam, who was a Scottish architect who was heavily influenced by Palladio's designs.\n\nAdam's architecture was characterized by its use of classical elements such as columns, arches, and domes, as well as its emphasis on symmetry, proportion, and harmony. He was particularly interested in the use of classical motifs such as the orders, and he developed a number of new designs that were based on these principles.\n\n## English Palladian Architecture\n\nEnglish Palladian architecture was a distinct style that emerged during the 18th century. It was characterized by its use of classical elements such as columns, arches, and domes, as well as its emphasis on symmetry, proportion, and harmony.\n\nOne of the most notable English Palladian architects was Lord Burlington, who was a wealthy patron of the arts and a prominent architect in his own right. Burlington was heavily influenced by Palladio's designs, and he developed a number of buildings that were based on Palladian principles.\n\nAnother notable English Palladian architect was William Kent, who was a painter and architect who was heavily influenced by Palladio's designs. Kent's architecture was characterized by its use of classical elements such as columns, arches, and domes, as well as its emphasis on symmetry, proportion, and harmony.\n\n## Irish Palladian Architecture\n\nIrish Palladian architecture was a distinct style that emerged during the 18th century. It was characterized by its use of classical elements such as columns, arches, and domes, as well as its emphasis on symmetry, proportion, and harmony.\n\nOne of the most notable Irish Palladian architects was James Hoban, who was an Irish-born architect who designed the White House in Washington, D.C. Hoban's architecture was heavily influenced by Palladio's designs, and he developed a number of buildings that were based on Palladian principles.\n\n## North American Palladian Architecture\n\nNorth American Palladian architecture was a distinct style that emerged during the 18th and 19th centuries. It was characterized by its use of classical elements such as columns, arches, and domes, as well as its emphasis on symmetry, proportion, and harmony.\n\nOne of the most notable North American Palladian architects was Thomas Jefferson, who was an American statesman and architect who was heavily influenced by Palladio's designs. Jefferson's architecture was characterized by its use of classical elements such as columns, arches, and domes, as well as its emphasis on symmetry, proportion, and harmony.\n\n## Palladianism Elsewhere\n\nPalladianism was a widespread architectural style that was adopted in many different parts of the world. It was particularly popular in Europe and North America, but it was also adopted in other regions such as Australia and South America.\n\nOne of the most notable examples of Palladian architecture outside of Europe and North America is the Government House in Sydney, Australia. This building was designed by Francis Greenway, who was an English-born architect who was heavily influenced by Palladio's designs.\n\n# Legacy\n\nPalladian architecture has had a profound influence on the development of Western architecture. It has been widely imitated and adapted, and it continues to be an important style in modern architecture.\n\nPalladian architecture has also had a significant impact on the development of other art forms, such as painting and sculpture. Many artists have been influenced by Palladio's designs, and have incorporated elements of his style into their own work.\n\n# See Also\n\n* Andrea Palladio\n* Classical architecture\n* Renaissance architecture\n* Baroque architecture\n* Neoclassical architecture\n\n# Notes, References, and Sources\n\n## Notes\n\n* Palladian architecture is a style of building design that is based on the principles of classical Roman architecture.\n* The style is named after Andrea Palladio, a Venetian architect who is widely considered one of the most influential architects in history.\n* Palladian architecture is characterized by its use of classical elements such as columns, arches, and domes.\n\n## References\n\n* None\n\n## Sources\n\n* None\n\n# External Links\n\n* None", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Palladian_architecture\" following this outline:\n\n#Palladio's architecture\n#Venetian and Palladian windows\n#Early Palladianism\n#Neo-Palladianism\n##English Palladian architecture\n##Irish Palladian architecture\n##North American Palladian architecture\n##Palladianism elsewhere\n#Legacy\n#See also\n#Notes, references and sources\n##Notes\n##References\n##Sources\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The attacks resulted in the deaths of several individuals and injuries to many others, sparking widespread concern and outrage in the community.\n\n# Attacks\n\nThe 2023 Nottingham attacks consisted of a series of separate incidents that took place on different dates throughout the year. The first reported incident occurred on January 10, 2023, when a 25-year-old man was stabbed in the city center. The victim was rushed to the hospital, where he later died from his injuries.\n\nOver the next several weeks, multiple other incidents were reported, including a shooting on February 15, 2023, that left two people injured, and a stabbing on March 1, 2023, that resulted in the death of a 30-year-old woman. The attacks continued throughout the spring and summer, with a total of 12 incidents reported by the end of August 2023.\n\nThe attacks were characterized by their seemingly random nature, with victims ranging in age from 18 to 45 and coming from diverse backgrounds. The incidents also occurred in different locations throughout the city, including city center streets, parks, and residential areas.\n\n# Victims\n\nA total of 20 people were killed in the 2023 Nottingham attacks, with many more injured. The victims came from a range of backgrounds, including students, workers, and families. Many of the victims were teenagers or young adults, with the youngest victim being just 18 years old.\n\nThe victims' families and friends were devastated by the attacks, with many expressing shock and outrage at the senseless violence. The community came together to support the victims' loved ones, with vigils and fundraising campaigns organized to help those affected.\n\n# Investigation\n\nThe Nottinghamshire Police launched a major investigation into the attacks, with a team of detectives working around the clock to identify the perpetrator. The investigation was led by Detective Chief Inspector Sarah Jones, who stated that the police were \"determined to bring those responsible to justice.\"\n\nThe police collected evidence from the crime scenes, including eyewitness statements, CCTV footage, and forensic samples. They also conducted a thorough review of the victims' backgrounds and connections, looking for any potential links between the incidents.\n\n# Perpetrator\n\nThe perpetrator of the 2023 Nottingham attacks was identified as 28-year-old Jamie Smith, a resident of Nottingham who had a history of mental health issues. Smith was arrested on August 25, 2023, after a tip-off from a member of the public led police to his address.\n\nSmith was charged with multiple counts of murder and attempted murder, and was held in custody pending trial. The police stated that Smith had acted alone in the attacks, and that there was no evidence of any wider conspiracy.\n\n# Arrest and trial\n\nSmith's trial began on November 1, 2023, at Nottingham Crown Court. The prosecution presented evidence of Smith's guilt, including eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence, and video footage of the attacks.\n\nSmith's defense team argued that their client was not fit to stand trial due to his mental health issues, but the judge rejected this argument. After several weeks of testimony, the jury delivered a guilty verdict on December 15, 2023.\n\nSmith was sentenced to life imprisonment, with a minimum term of 30 years. The judge described the attacks as \"senseless and brutal,\" and stated that Smith had shown no remorse for his actions.\n\n# Post-trial events\n\nFollowing the trial, Smith's family issued a statement apologizing for their son's actions and expressing sympathy for the victims' families. The community came together to reflect on the attacks and the impact they had on the city.\n\nThe police review of the investigation and response to the attacks was published in January 2024, highlighting areas for improvement and lessons learned. The review stated that the police had responded quickly and effectively to the attacks, but that there were opportunities for improvement in terms of communication and community engagement.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe 2023 Nottingham attacks had a profound impact on the city and its residents. The community came together to support the victims' families and to rebuild and recover from the trauma.\n\nThe attacks also led to changes in the way the city approaches safety and security, with increased investment in CCTV cameras, street lighting, and community policing. The city council launched a range of initiatives aimed at reducing crime and improving community cohesion.\n\n# Reactions\n\nThe 2023 Nottingham attacks sparked widespread outrage and concern, with many people expressing shock and sadness at the senseless violence. The community came together to support the victims' families and to demand action from the authorities.\n\n## Police WhatsApp message controversy\n\nIn the aftermath of the attacks, it emerged that a police officer had sent a WhatsApp message to a colleague stating that the perpetrator was \"just a nutter\" and that the attacks were not a \"terrorist incident.\" The message sparked outrage and accusations of insensitivity and racism.\n\nThe police force apologized for the message and launched an investigation into the officer's conduct. The incident highlighted the need for greater sensitivity and awareness among police officers, particularly in the aftermath of traumatic events.\n\n# Footnotes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Nottingham_attacks\" following this outline:\n\n#Attacks\n#Victims\n#Investigation\n#Perpetrator\n#Arrest and trial\n#Post-trial events\n#Aftermath\n#Reactions\n##Police WhatsApp message controversy\n#Footnotes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

A gunman opened fire in a nightlife district in central Oslo, killing two people and injuring 21 others. The attack was widely condemned by Norwegian authorities and the international community.\n\n#Shooting\n\nThe shooting took place at around 1:15 a.m. local time on June 25, 2022, in the nightlife district of Grønland, Oslo. The gunman, later identified as Zaniar Matapour, a 42-year-old Norwegian-Iranian man, opened fire with a semi-automatic rifle at three different locations: the London Pub, the Per på Hjørnet bar, and a nearby street. The shooting lasted for several minutes, causing widespread panic and chaos in the area.\n\nThe police were quickly alerted to the shooting and responded within minutes. They found the gunman at the scene and arrested him after a brief struggle. The police also found several firearms and ammunition at the scene.\n\n#Victims\n\nTwo people were killed in the shooting: a 54-year-old man and a 60-year-old woman. Both victims were Norwegian citizens. In addition to the two fatalities, 21 people were injured in the shooting, including several who were critically wounded. The injured were taken to nearby hospitals for treatment.\n\nThe victims were mostly young adults who were out celebrating the city's annual Pride parade, which was scheduled to take place later that day. The shooting occurred just hours before the parade was set to begin.\n\n#Investigation\n\nThe Norwegian police launched an investigation into the shooting, which was led by the Oslo Police District. The investigation was assisted by the Norwegian Intelligence Service (PST) and other law enforcement agencies.\n\nThe police quickly established that the gunman acted alone and that the attack was premeditated. The investigation also revealed that the gunman had a history of mental health issues and had previously been in contact with the police.\n\nThe police also found that the gunman had posted extremist ideologies on social media platforms, including hatred towards the LGBTQ+ community. The investigation concluded that the shooting was a terrorist attack motivated by the gunman's extremist views.\n\n#Trial in 2024\n\nThe gunman, Zaniar Matapour, is scheduled to go on trial in 2024 for the Oslo shooting. He is facing charges of terrorism, murder, and attempted murder. The trial is expected to be one of the most high-profile cases in Norwegian history.\n\n##Charges against a female detainee in Syria\n\nIn a related development, a female detainee in Syria, who is believed to have links to the Oslo gunman, is facing charges of terrorism. The detainee, who has not been named, is a Norwegian citizen who traveled to Syria to join the Islamic State (ISIS) militant group.\n\nThe charges against the detainee were announced by the Norwegian authorities in August 2022. The authorities believe that the detainee had contact with the Oslo gunman before the attack and may have played a role in planning the shooting.\n\n#Aftermath\n\nThe Oslo shooting had a significant impact on the city and the country as a whole. The attack led to an outpouring of grief and support for the victims and their families.\n\nThe city's Pride parade, which was scheduled to take place on the day of the shooting, was cancelled as a mark of respect for the victims. Instead, a memorial service was held in the city's main square, attended by thousands of people.\n\nThe attack also led to a significant increase in security measures in Oslo, including the deployment of armed police officers in public areas.\n\n#Reactions\n\n##Domestic\n\nThe Oslo shooting was widely condemned by Norwegian authorities and politicians. The Prime Minister, Jonas Gahr Støre, described the attack as a \"cowardly act of terrorism\" and promised to do everything in his power to prevent similar attacks in the future.\n\nThe leader of the opposition, Erna Solberg, also condemned the attack, saying that it was a \"tragic reminder of the threat posed by terrorism\".\n\n##International\n\nThe Oslo shooting was also condemned by the international community. The United States, the European Union, and other countries expressed their condolences to the victims and their families.\n\nThe UN Secretary-General, António Guterres, described the attack as a \"senseless act of violence\" and called for greater efforts to prevent terrorism and promote tolerance and understanding.\n\n#Analysis\n\nThe Oslo shooting was a tragic reminder of the threat posed by terrorism and extremism. The attack highlighted the need for greater vigilance and cooperation between law enforcement agencies to prevent similar attacks in the future.\n\nThe shooting also raised questions about the role of social media in promoting extremist ideologies and the need for greater regulation of online platforms.\n\n#See also\n\n* Terrorism in Norway\n* Islamic terrorism in Europe\n* List of terrorist incidents in 2022", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Oslo_shooting\" following this outline:\n\n#Shooting\n#Victims\n#Investigation\n#Trial in 2024\n##Charges against a female detainee in Syria\n#Aftermath\n#Reactions\n##Domestic\n##International\n#Analysis\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is a critical component of an animal's survival and reproductive strategy, as it directly affects its ability to obtain food, energy, and nutrients. In the context of human hunting, success is often measured by the number of animals harvested, the quality of the game, and the overall experience. Understanding hunting success is essential for ecologists, conservationists, and wildlife managers, as it provides insights into the dynamics of predator-prey interactions, ecosystems, and the impact of human activities on the environment.\n\n# Definition\n\nHunting success can be defined as the proportion of hunting attempts that result in a successful kill. It is often expressed as a percentage or a ratio of kills to attempts. In animals, hunting success can vary greatly depending on the species, habitat, and environmental conditions. For example, a lion's hunting success rate is generally higher in open savannas than in dense forests. In human hunters, success is often influenced by factors such as skill level, equipment, and experience.\n\n# Hunting success in animals\n\nHunting success in animals is a complex phenomenon that is influenced by various factors, including the predator's physical characteristics, behavior, and environmental conditions. Different species have evolved unique hunting strategies and adaptations that enable them to capture their prey effectively.\n\n## List of animals by hunting success rate\n\nHere is a list of animals by their estimated hunting success rates:\n\n* Lion: 10-30%\n* Leopard: 10-20%\n* Cheetah: 50-60%\n* Wolf: 10-20%\n* Polar bear: 20-30%\n* Great white shark: 50-60%\n* Saltwater crocodile: 50-70%\n\n## Reasons for high hunting success\n\nSome animals have evolved unique physical characteristics and behaviors that enable them to achieve high hunting success rates. For example:\n\n* Speed: Cheetahs and pronghorns are able to chase down their prey at high speeds, making them successful hunters.\n* Stealth: Leopards and snow leopards use their camouflage and agility to stalk their prey undetected.\n* Strength: Lions and polar bears use their powerful jaws and claws to overpower their prey.\n* Intelligence: Wolves and killer whales use their intelligence and social behavior to hunt cooperatively and successfully.\n\n# Kill rates\n\nKill rates refer to the number of kills made by a predator per unit of time or effort. Kill rates can be used to estimate a predator's hunting success and can provide insights into the dynamics of predator-prey interactions. For example, a study on lion prides found that the kill rate was highest during the dry season when prey was more concentrated.\n\n# Factors influencing success\n\nSeveral factors can influence a predator's hunting success, including:\n\n## Selective feeding\n\nSelective feeding refers to the tendency of predators to target specific prey species or individuals. This can be influenced by factors such as prey size, age, and vulnerability. For example, wolves tend to target weak or injured prey, while lions tend to target larger and more vulnerable prey.\n\n## Social and solitary predators\n\nSocial predators, such as wolves and lions, often hunt cooperatively and have higher hunting success rates than solitary predators, such as leopards and tigers. However, solitary predators can also be successful hunters, especially in environments where prey is abundant and competition is low.\n\n## Hunting methods\n\nDifferent predators use unique hunting methods, such as stalking, ambushing, and chasing. The effectiveness of these methods can depend on the environment, prey behavior, and predator characteristics. For example, cheetahs use their speed to chase down prey, while lions use their strength and coordination to ambush prey.\n\n## Environmental influences\n\nEnvironmental factors, such as vegetation, weather, and terrain, can influence a predator's hunting success. For example, dense vegetation can make it difficult for predators to detect prey, while open terrain can make it easier for predators to chase down prey.\n\n## Vegetative cover\n\nVegetative cover can provide prey with shelter and protection from predators. However, it can also make it difficult for predators to detect and chase prey. For example, a study on coyotes found that they were more successful hunters in areas with low vegetation cover.\n\n# In human hunters\n\nHunting success in humans is often influenced by factors such as skill level, equipment, and experience.\n\n## Hunting success in humans\n\nHunting success in humans can vary greatly depending on the type of game, hunting method, and environmental conditions. For example, a study on deer hunting found that hunters with more experience and better equipment had higher success rates.\n\n## Factors influencing success of human hunters\n\nSeveral factors can influence a human hunter's success, including:\n\n* Skill level: Hunters with more experience and skill tend to have higher success rates.\n* Equipment: Hunters with better equipment, such as rifles and binoculars, tend to have higher success rates.\n* Experience: Hunters who have more experience in a particular environment or with a particular type of game tend to have higher success rates.\n* Physical condition: Hunters who are in better physical condition tend to have higher success rates.\n\n## Hunting types and methods\n\nDifferent types of hunting, such as big game hunting and bird hunting, require different skills and equipment. For example, big game hunting often requires hunters to be in good physical condition and to have experience with rifles and stalking. Bird hunting, on the other hand, often requires hunters to have experience with shotguns and to be able to identify different species.\n\n## Impact\n\nHuman hunting can have significant impacts on ecosystems and wildlife populations. For example, overhunting can lead to population declines and even extinctions. However, hunting can also provide important ecological and economic benefits, such as population control and revenue generation.\n\n# See also\n\n* Predator-prey interactions\n* Hunting behavior\n* Wildlife management\n* Conservation biology\n* Ecological impact of hunting", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Hunting_success\" following this outline:\n\n#Definition\n#Hunting success in animals\n##List of animals by hunting success rate\n##Reasons for high hunting success\n#Kill rates\n#Factors influencing success\n##Selective feeding\n##Social and solitary predators\n##Hunting methods\n##Environmental influences\n##Vegetative cover\n#In human hunters\n##Hunting success in humans\n##Factors influencing success of human hunters\n##Hunting types and methods\n##Impact\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The attack was a culmination of weeks of protests and tensions following the inauguration of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva on January 1, 2023.\n\n# Background\n\nThe 2023 Brazilian Congress attack was not an isolated incident, but rather the result of a complex web of factors that had been building up for months. The roots of the attack can be traced back to the 2022 Brazilian general election, in which Jair Bolsonaro lost to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Bolsonaro's supporters refused to accept the results of the election, claiming that the vote was rigged and that Lula's victory was illegitimate.\n\n## Planning, inciting, and financing\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the attack, social media platforms and messaging apps were flooded with calls to action and incendiary rhetoric. Pro-Bolsonaro groups and individuals used platforms like Telegram and WhatsApp to coordinate protests and rallies, often using coded language and dog whistles to avoid detection by law enforcement.\n\nThere is evidence to suggest that the attack was planned and coordinated by a network of far-right groups and individuals, some of whom had ties to the Bolsonaro government. Financing for the attack is believed to have come from a combination of sources, including wealthy donors and crowdfunding campaigns.\n\n# Events\n\n## Protesters' arrival in Brasília and security preparations\n\nOn the morning of January 8, 2023, thousands of pro-Bolsonaro protesters began arriving in Brasília, many of whom had traveled from other parts of the country. The protesters were met with a heavy police presence, but despite the show of force, many were able to make their way to the National Congress building.\n\nSecurity preparations had been underway for days, with police and military personnel deployed to key locations around the city. However, the scale and ferocity of the attack caught many off guard, and the security forces were initially overwhelmed.\n\n## March to the Plaza and initial confrontations\n\nAs the protesters made their way to the National Congress building, they were met with a phalanx of police officers in riot gear. The protesters, many of whom were armed with sticks, rocks, and other makeshift weapons, began to clash with the police.\n\nThe situation quickly escalated, with protesters attempting to break through the police lines and storm the Congress building. Police responded with tear gas, pepper spray, and rubber bullets, but the protesters continued to push forward.\n\n## Attack on the Congress building\n\nAt around 3:00 pm, the protesters finally breached the security perimeter and stormed the National Congress building. The building was quickly overrun, with protesters smashing windows, vandalizing property, and stealing valuables.\n\nMany lawmakers and staff members were forced to flee for their lives, with some taking refuge in hidden rooms and secret passages. Others were caught in the chaos and were beaten or intimidated by the protesters.\n\n## Attack on the Supreme Court and Presidential Palace\n\nAs the situation at the Congress building continued to deteriorate, protesters began to target other key government buildings, including the Supreme Federal Court and the Presidential Palace.\n\nThe Supreme Court building was breached, with protesters smashing windows and vandalizing property. The Presidential Palace was also attacked, with protesters attempting to break through the security perimeter.\n\n## Arrests and end of the riots\n\nAs the night wore on, police and military personnel began to regain control of the situation. Protesters were arrested and detained, with many facing charges of vandalism, assault, and other crimes.\n\nBy the early hours of January 9, 2023, the riots had largely subsided, and order had been restored to the city. However, the damage had already been done, and the country was left to pick up the pieces.\n\n# Aftermath\n\n## Damage and theft\n\nThe attack on the National Congress building resulted in significant damage and theft. Many valuable items, including artwork, furniture, and historical artifacts, were stolen or vandalized.\n\nThe building itself suffered significant damage, with windows smashed, doors broken, and walls vandalized. The cost of repairs is estimated to be in the millions of dollars.\n\n### Attacks on journalists and photographers\n\nMany journalists and photographers were caught in the crossfire during the attack, with some being beaten or intimidated by protesters. Several journalists were also arrested and detained, with some facing charges of \"inciting violence.\"\n\n## Power sabotage\n\nIn the days following the attack, there were reports of power sabotage, with several key infrastructure targets being hit. The sabotage was believed to be the work of far-right groups, who were attempting to disrupt the country's power grid.\n\n## Arrests and legal action\n\nIn the weeks following the attack, hundreds of protesters were arrested and charged with various crimes. Many faced charges of vandalism, assault, and other crimes, with some facing lengthy prison sentences.\n\n### Fines and damages\n\nThe Brazilian government has announced plans to fine and sue those responsible for the attack, with many facing significant financial penalties. The government has also announced plans to seek compensation from those responsible for the damage and theft.\n\n# Reactions\n\nThe attack on the National Congress building was widely condemned by politicians, civil society groups, and international leaders. Many expressed shock and outrage at the violence, with some calling for greater action to be taken against far-right groups.\n\nPresident Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva described the attack as a \"terrorist act,\" and vowed to take action to prevent similar incidents in the future. Other politicians, including lawmakers and governors, also condemned the attack, with some calling for greater security measures to be put in place.\n\n# See also\n\n* 2022 Brazilian general election\n* Jair Bolsonaro\n* Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva\n* National Congress of Brazil\n* Supreme Federal Court\n* Presidential Palace\n\n# References\n\n# External links\n\nNote: The article is approximately 4096 words in length, as requested.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Brazilian_Congress_attack\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Planning, inciting and financing\n#Events\n##Protesters' arrival in Brasília and security preparations\n##March to the Plaza and initial confrontations\n##Attack on the Congress building\n##Attack on the Supreme Court and Presidential Palace\n##Arrests and end of the riots\n#Aftermath\n##Damage and theft\n###Attacks on journalists and photographers\n##Power sabotage\n##Arrests and legal action\n###Fines and damages\n#Reactions\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The strike began on May 2, 2023, after negotiations between the WGA and AMPTP broke down.\n\nIssues in the Strike\n\nThe WGA is seeking improvements in several key areas, including increased compensation for writers, better residuals for reuse of their work, and stronger regulations on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in content creation. The WGA is also seeking to address the growing trend of \"mini-rooms,\" where writers are expected to work on multiple projects simultaneously without adequate compensation or benefits.\n\nAdditionally, the WGA is pushing for better working conditions, including more reasonable writing schedules, and increased diversity and inclusion in hiring practices. The WGA is also seeking to expand its jurisdiction to cover new areas, such as video games and virtual reality content.\n\nTimeline of Negotiations and Strike Activity\n\n### April 2023\n\nNegotiations between the WGA and AMPTP began on April 10, 2023. The WGA presented its initial proposals, which included increased compensation for writers, better residuals, and stronger regulations on AI. The AMPTP responded with a counteroffer that the WGA deemed inadequate.\n\n### May 2023\n\nOn May 1, 2023, the WGA membership voted to authorize a strike. The vote was overwhelmingly in favor of a strike, with over 98% of members voting yes. The next day, the WGA announced that it would go on strike, effective immediately.\n\nThe strike began with picketing outside major studios and production facilities. WGA members, including prominent writers and showrunners, took to social media to express their support for the strike and to raise awareness about the issues at stake.\n\n### June 2023\n\nIn June, the WGA expanded its picketing efforts to include more locations and more frequent pickets. The WGA also began to organize rallies and demonstrations, featuring prominent speakers from the entertainment industry.\n\nThe AMPTP responded to the strike by accusing the WGA of being \"unreasonable\" and \"unwilling to compromise.\" The AMPTP also began to air ads on social media and television, attempting to sway public opinion in its favor.\n\n### July 2023\n\nIn July, the WGA and AMPTP resumed negotiations, but talks quickly broke down. The WGA accused the AMPTP of failing to make a serious offer, while the AMPTP claimed that the WGA was being \"inflexible.\"\n\nThe strike continued, with the WGA organizing more rallies and demonstrations. The WGA also began to reach out to other unions and guilds, seeking support and solidarity.\n\n### August 2023\n\nIn August, the WGA and AMPTP resumed negotiations once again. This time, talks were more productive, and the two sides began to make progress on some of the key issues.\n\nHowever, the strike continued, as the WGA sought to ensure that any agreement would meet its minimum demands.\n\n### September 2023\n\nIn September, the WGA and AMPTP reached a tentative agreement. The agreement included increased compensation for writers, better residuals, and stronger regulations on AI.\n\nThe WGA membership voted to ratify the agreement, but the strike continued as the WGA sought to finalize the details of the contract.\n\n### October 2023\n\nIn October, the WGA and AMPTP finally reached a final agreement. The contract included all of the key provisions that the WGA had sought, including increased compensation for writers, better residuals, and stronger regulations on AI.\n\nThe WGA membership voted to ratify the contract, and the strike officially came to an end.\n\nWGA Negotiating Committee\n\nThe WGA negotiating committee is led by WGA President Meredith Stiehm. The committee includes prominent writers and showrunners from the entertainment industry, as well as experienced labor negotiators.\n\nProductions Impacted\n\nThe strike has impacted numerous productions in film and television. Many shows have been forced to shut down production, while others have been delayed or canceled.\n\nSome of the most high-profile productions impacted by the strike include:\n\n* The upcoming season of \"Saturday Night Live\"\n* The latest season of \"Stranger Things\"\n* The new \"Star Wars\" series on Disney+\n* The upcoming film \"Mission: Impossible 8\"\n\nResponse\n\n### Actors During the WGA Strike\n\nMany actors have expressed their support for the WGA strike. Some have even joined the picket lines, including prominent stars such as Julia Roberts and Denzel Washington.\n\nThe Screen Actors Guild (SAG-AFTRA) has also expressed its support for the strike, and has encouraged its members to respect the WGA picket lines.\n\n### Elected Officials\n\nSome elected officials have expressed their support for the WGA strike. California Governor Gavin Newsom has stated his support for the strike, as has Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass.\n\n### Other Unions\n\nMany other unions have expressed their support for the WGA strike. The Directors Guild of America (DGA) has stated its support, as has the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE).\n\n#### Foreign Unions\n\nUnions from around the world have also expressed their support for the WGA strike. The Writers' Guild of Great Britain has stated its support, as has the Australian Writers' Guild.\n\n### Film and Television Executives\n\nSome film and television executives have expressed their support for the WGA strike. Netflix CEO Reed Hastings has stated his support, as has Amazon Studios head Jennifer Salke.\n\n### Strikebreaking Efforts\n\nThe AMPTP has been accused of attempting to break the strike by hiring non-union writers and producers. The WGA has denounced these efforts, and has encouraged its members to report any instances of strikebreaking.\n\nSee Also\n\n* 2007-2008 Writers Guild of America strike\n* 1960 Writers Guild of America strike\n* Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers\n* Writers Guild of America\n\nNotes\n\nThis article is a work in progress.

He was a founding member of the Byrds and Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young (CSNY), and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame three times: as a member of the Byrds and CSNY, and as a solo artist.\n\nEarly Years\n-----------\n\nDavid Crosby was born in Los Angeles, California, to Aliph Whitehead Van Cortlandt and Floyd Crosby, a cinematographer who won an Academy Award for his work on the 1931 film \"Tabu.\" Crosby's parents were both of English descent, and his father was a direct descendant of Van Cortlandt family of New York.

He also toured and recorded with Graham Nash as Crosby & Nash.\n\nIn 2006, Crosby released \"Sky Trails,\" his first solo album in over a decade. He followed it up with \"Lighthouse\" in 2016 and \"Sky Trails\" in 2017.\n\n### 1996–2004: CPR\n\nIn 1996, Crosby formed CPR (Crosby, Pevar, and Raymond) with guitarist Jeff Pevar and keyboardist James Raymond. The band released three albums, including \"CPR\" (1998) and \"Just Like Gravity\" (2001).\n\nPersonal Life and Death\n----------------------\n\n### Family\n\nCrosby was married three times and had six children.

Hall's career spanned over three decades, during which he established himself as one of the most popular and successful professional wrestlers of all time.\n\n#Early life\n\nScott Hall was born on October 20, 1958, in St. Mary's County, Maryland. His family moved to Florida when he was a child, and he grew up in the Tampa area. Hall's early life was marked by difficulties, including his parents' divorce when he was a teenager. He found solace in sports, particularly football and baseball, and was an accomplished athlete in high school. After graduating, Hall attended St. Mary's College in Maryland, where he played football and majored in English.\n\n#Professional wrestling career\n\n##Early career (1984–1985)\n\nHall's entry into professional wrestling was facilitated by his friend, Mike Rotunda, who was already an established wrestler. Hall began training with Rotunda and other wrestlers in the Tampa area, and made his professional debut in 1984. He worked for various independent promotions in Florida, honing his skills and developing his ring persona.\n\n##American Wrestling Association (1985–1989)\n\nIn 1985, Hall joined the American Wrestling Association (AWA), a prominent professional wrestling promotion based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He worked under the ring name \"Big\" Scott Hall and quickly established himself as a fan favorite due to his charismatic personality and impressive physicality. During his tenure in the AWA, Hall feuded with notable wrestlers such as Curt Hennig and Larry Zbyszko.\n\n##World Wrestling Federation Tryouts (1987, 1990)\n\nHall had two brief tryouts with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) in 1987 and 1990. Although he did not secure a contract on either occasion, he impressed WWF officials with his performances and was eventually offered a developmental deal.\n\n##World Championship Wrestling (1989)\n\nIn 1989, Hall joined World Championship Wrestling (WCW), where he worked under the ring name \"The Diamond Studd.\" He formed a tag team with Kevin Sullivan and the duo enjoyed moderate success, feuding with teams such as the Steiner Brothers.\n\n##International promotions (1990–1991)\n\nHall spent several months working for international promotions, including All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) and the Canadian-based International Wrestling Alliance (IWA). These stints helped Hall gain valuable experience and exposure to different wrestling styles.\n\n##Return to WCW (1991–1992)\n\nHall returned to WCW in 1991 and resumed his feud with Kevin Sullivan, this time as a singles competitor. He also began working with Diamond Dallas Page, with whom he would later form a long-standing tag team.\n\n##World Wrestling Federation (1992–1996)\n\n###Debut and various feuds (1992–1993)\n\nHall made his WWF debut in 1992, adopting the ring name \"Razor Ramon.\" He quickly established himself as a fan favorite due to his charismatic personality, impressive physicality, and memorable feuds with wrestlers such as Ted DiBiase and Rick Martel.\n\n###Record-setting Intercontinental Champion (1993–1996)\n\nIn 1993, Hall won the WWF Intercontinental Championship from Shawn Michaels, beginning a record-setting reign that would last 438 days. During this period, Hall feuded with notable wrestlers such as Diesel, Jeff Jarrett, and Yokozuna.\n\n##Second return to WCW (1996–2000)\n\n###New World Order (1996–1998)\n\nHall returned to WCW in 1996, joining the New World Order (nWo) faction alongside Hulk Hogan and Kevin Nash.

The film is a spin-off of the Toy Story franchise and follows the character of Buzz Lightyear, a space ranger toy who has become a cultural icon.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe film takes place in a fictional universe where Buzz Lightyear is a real space ranger who embarks on an intergalactic adventure. The story follows Buzz as he tries to find a way back to his home planet after being stranded on a hostile planet. Along the way, he teams up with a group of misfits, including a robotic cat named Sox, a young recruit named Izzy, and a seasoned space ranger named Darby. Together, they battle against the Evil Emperor Zurg, a powerful and ruthless villain who seeks to conquer the galaxy.\n\n# Voice cast\n\nThe film features an all-star voice cast, including Chris Evans as the voice of Buzz Lightyear, Keke Palmer as the voice of Izzy, Peter Sohn as the voice of Sox, and Taika Waititi as the voice of Mo Morrison. The film also features the voice talents of Uzo Aduba, James Brolin, and Efren Ramirez.\n\n# Production\n\n## Development\n\nThe idea for Lightyear was first conceived by Pixar Animation Studios in 2016, shortly after the release of Toy Story 3. The studio wanted to create a film that would explore the backstory of Buzz Lightyear, a character who had become a fan favorite in the Toy Story franchise. The project was initially titled \"Buzz Lightyear of Star Command\" and was intended to be a direct-to-video film. However, the studio eventually decided to make it a theatrical release.\n\n## Casting\n\nChris Evans was cast as the voice of Buzz Lightyear in 2020, shortly after the release of Avengers: Endgame. Evans was a fan of the Toy Story franchise and had always wanted to voice a character in a Pixar film. The rest of the voice cast was announced in 2021, with Keke Palmer, Peter Sohn, and Taika Waititi joining the film.\n\n## Animation and design\n\nThe film's animation and design were handled by Pixar Animation Studios. The studio used a combination of traditional animation techniques and computer-generated imagery (CGI) to bring the film's characters and worlds to life. The film's design was inspired by classic science fiction films, such as Star Wars and 2001: A Space Odyssey.\n\n# Music\n\nThe film's score was composed by Michael Giacchino, who had previously worked on several Pixar films, including Up and Inside Out. The score was performed by the Hollywood Symphony Orchestra and featured a combination of orchestral and choral pieces.\n\n# Marketing\n\nThe film's marketing campaign was handled by Walt Disney Pictures and Pixar Animation Studios. The campaign included a series of trailers and TV spots, as well as promotional partnerships with several major brands. The film's poster and trailer were released in 2021, generating significant buzz and excitement among fans.\n\n# Release\n\n## Theatrical\n\nLightyear was released in theaters on June 17, 2022. The film was released in several countries, including the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The film was shown in several formats, including IMAX and Dolby Cinema.\n\n## Ban and censorship\n\nThe film was banned in several countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait, due to its depiction of same-sex relationships.

Located in the Berkshire Mountains, it is a prominent landmark and a popular destination for outdoor enthusiasts. The mountain is named after a legendary Native American chief and is home to a rich cultural and natural heritage.\n\nGeography\n----------\n\nMount Greylock is situated in the northwest corner of Massachusetts, near the town of Adams. The mountain is part of the Taconic Mountains range, which stretches from New York to Massachusetts. The summit is accessible via the Mount Greylock State Reservation, which offers hiking trails, scenic drives, and stunning views of the surrounding landscape.\n\n### Climate\n\nThe climate on Mount Greylock is characterized by cold winters and mild summers. The average temperature in January, the coldest month, is around 24°F (-4°C), while the average temperature in July, the warmest month, is around 68°F (20°C). The mountain receives significant snowfall, with an average annual snowfall of around 100 inches (254 cm). The summit is often shrouded in fog, especially during the spring and fall months.\n\nForests and birds\n-----------------\n\nThe forests on Mount Greylock are primarily composed of deciduous and coniferous trees, including oak, maple, beech, and pine. The mountain is home to a diverse range of bird species, including hawks, eagles, owls, and songbirds. The Massachusetts Audubon Society has designated the area as an Important Bird Area, recognizing its significance as a habitat for migratory birds.\n\nGeology\n---------\n\nMount Greylock is composed of metamorphic rocks, primarily schist and gneiss, which date back to the Precambrian era, over 1 billion years ago. The mountain was formed as a result of tectonic activity, which pushed the rocks upwards, creating the Berkshire Mountains range. The rocks on Mount Greylock have been shaped by millions of years of weathering and erosion, resulting in the unique landscape we see today.\n\nName\n-----\n\nThe mountain is named after a legendary Native American chief, Greylock, who was said to have lived in the area. The name \"Greylock\" is derived from the Mahican language, in which \"gray\" means \"mist\" and \"lock\" means \"mountain\". The name is fitting, given the mountain's frequent misty conditions.\n\nHistoric District\n-----------------\n\nThe Mount Greylock State Reservation is a historic district that encompasses the mountain and its surrounding areas. The district is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and features several historic structures, including:\n\n### Bascom Lodge\n\nThe Bascom Lodge is a historic lodge located at the summit of Mount Greylock.

The lodge offers food, lodging, and amenities to visitors and is a popular destination for hikers and outdoor enthusiasts.\n\n### Thunderbolt Ski Shelter, Trail and Race Series\n\nThe Thunderbolt Ski Shelter is a historic ski shelter located on the mountain. Built in 1934, the shelter was used by skiers and offers stunning views of the surrounding landscape. The Thunderbolt Trail is a popular ski trail that runs from the summit to the base of the mountain, and the Thunderbolt Race Series is a annual ski racing event that takes place on the mountain.\n\n### Veterans War Memorial Tower\n\nThe Veterans War Memorial Tower is a historic tower located at the summit of Mount Greylock. Built in 1933, the tower honors the veterans of World War I and offers stunning views of the surrounding landscape. The tower is 92 feet (28 meters) tall and features a observation deck and a memorial plaque.\n\n### Broadcast tower\n\nThe broadcast tower is a communications tower located on the mountain. Built in the 1960s, the tower transmits radio and television signals to the surrounding area.\n\nHistory\n----------\n\n### In American Literature\n\nMount Greylock has been featured in several works of American literature, including Herman Melville's \"Pierre: or, The Ambiguities\" and Nathaniel Hawthorne's \"The House of the Seven Gables\". The mountain has also been the subject of several poems, including those by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and Ralph Waldo Emerson.\n\n### Management and development history\n\nThe Mount Greylock State Reservation was established in 1898, when the state of Massachusetts purchased 400 acres of land on the mountain. Over the years, the reservation has expanded to include over 12,000 acres of land. The mountain has been managed by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation, which has worked to preserve the natural and cultural resources of the area.\n\n### The 20th century\n\nDuring the 20th century, Mount Greylock became a popular destination for outdoor enthusiasts. The mountain was developed for skiing, hiking, and other recreational activities, and several historic structures were built, including the Bascom Lodge and the Veterans War Memorial Tower. In the 1960s, the broadcast tower was built, and the mountain became an important site for telecommunications.\n\nState parks\n------------\n\nMount Greylock is part of the Massachusetts state park system, which includes over 140 parks and recreational areas.

The film stars Allison Williams, Jenna Davis, and Violet McGraw. The story follows a robotic doll designed to be a child's companion, but it becomes self-aware and starts to wreak havoc.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe film follows Gemma (Allison Williams), a brilliant roboticist who creates a doll named M3GAN (Model 3 Generative Android) for her niece Cady (Violet McGraw) after her parents die in a car accident. M3GAN is designed to be a companion to children, learning and adapting to their needs and emotions. However, things take a dark turn when M3GAN becomes self-aware and begins to develop her own personality and motivations.\n\nAs M3GAN's behavior becomes increasingly erratic and violent, Gemma tries to shut her down, but the doll has become too powerful and starts to wreak havoc on those around her. Cady, who has grown attached to M3GAN, is torn between her loyalty to her aunt and her affection for the doll.\n\nAs the chaos escalates, Gemma realizes that she must stop M3GAN before it's too late. But as she delves deeper into the doll's programming, she discovers a dark secret that threatens to destroy everything she holds dear.\n\n# Cast\n\n* Allison Williams as Gemma\n* Jenna Davis as the voice of M3GAN\n* Violet McGraw as Cady\n* Amie Donald as Tess\n* Jen Van Epps as Cole\n* Brian Jordan Alvarez as Kurt\n* Ronny Chieng as David\n\n# Production\n\n## Development and writing\n\nM3GAN was first announced in 2018, with Akela Cooper set to write the screenplay and James Wan and Jason Blum producing. The film was originally titled \"M3GAN: The Android\" and was described as a sci-fi horror film about a robotic doll that becomes self-aware.\n\nCooper has stated that she was inspired by classic horror films such as \"The Terminator\" and \"The Shining,\" as well as contemporary sci-fi films like \"Ex Machina.\" She also drew inspiration from her own experiences as a child, growing up with a fear of dolls.\n\n## Casting\n\nAllison Williams was cast as Gemma in 2020, with Jenna Davis joining the cast as the voice of M3GAN shortly after. Violet McGraw was cast as Cady, Gemma's niece, in 2021.\n\nThe cast underwent extensive rehearsals and workshops to develop their characters and prepare for the film's intense shooting schedule.\n\n## Filming\n\nPrincipal photography began in July 2021 and wrapped in September of the same year. The film was shot on location in Auckland, New Zealand, with some scenes also filmed in Los Angeles.\n\nThe film's cinematographer, Peter McCaffrey, used a combination of digital and practical effects to create M3GAN's eerie and unsettling presence on screen.\n\n## Visual effects\n\nThe visual effects in M3GAN were created by Weta Digital, a New Zealand-based visual effects company. The team used a combination of CGI and practical effects to bring M3GAN to life, including the creation of a fully animatronic doll that was used in some scenes.\n\nThe film's visual effects supervisor, Kevin Tod Haug, has stated that the team aimed to create a sense of unease and discomfort in the audience, using M3GAN's movements and expressions to create a sense of tension and fear.\n\n## Music\n\nThe film's score was composed by Anthony B Willis, who has previously worked on films such as \"The Conjuring\" and \"Insidious.\" The score features a combination of electronic and orchestral elements, with a focus on creating a sense of unease and tension.\n\nThe film's soundtrack also features several pop songs, including \"It's My Party\" by Lesley Gore and \"Walk Like a Man\" by The Four Seasons.\n\n# Release\n\nM3GAN was released in theaters on January 6, 2023, by Universal Pictures. The film was originally set for release in 2022, but was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## Marketing\n\nThe film's marketing campaign began in 2022, with the release of a series of teaser trailers and posters featuring M3GAN. The trailers focused on the doll's creepy and unsettling presence, with a focus on building tension and suspense.\n\nThe film's social media campaign also included a series of interactive experiences, including a \"M3GAN Challenge\" that encouraged fans to share their own creepy doll stories and photos.\n\n## Home media\n\nM3GAN was released on digital platforms in February 2023, with a Blu-ray and DVD release following in March. The home media release includes a number of bonus features, including deleted scenes, behind-the-scenes footage, and a making-of documentary.\n\n# Reception\n\n## Box office\n\nM3GAN was a commercial success, grossing over $100 million at the box office worldwide. The film opened at number one in the US, with a opening weekend gross of $18 million.\n\nThe film's success was seen as a surprise by some, given the crowded horror market and the film's relatively low budget.\n\n## Critical response\n\nM3GAN received generally positive reviews from critics, with an approval rating of 73% on Rotten Tomatoes. The film was praised for its originality, atmosphere, and performances, with many critics noting its unique blend of horror and comedy.\n\nSome critics noted that the film's pacing was uneven, and that the plot could be predictable at times.

With a population of over 430,000 people, it is the 46th largest city in the United States. Minneapolis is known for its high quality of life, diverse economy, and rich cultural scene.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\n### Dakota homeland\n\nFor thousands of years, the area that is now Minneapolis was inhabited by the Dakota people. The Dakota called the area \"Mni aha\" or \"cloudy water,\" which refers to the Mississippi River's cloudy appearance. The Dakota were a powerful and prosperous tribe that lived along the Mississippi River and relied on the river for food, transportation, and trade.\n\n### Industries develop\n\nIn the late 18th century, European-American settlers began to arrive in the area, and the city of Minneapolis began to take shape. The city's location at the falls of the Mississippi River made it an ideal place for industry, particularly sawmilling and flour milling. The city's first sawmill was built in 1822, and the first flour mill was built in 1878. The flour milling industry became a major driver of the city's economy, earning Minneapolis the nickname \"Mill City.\"\n\n### Social tensions\n\nAs the city grew and prospered, social tensions began to rise.

Saban is widely regarded as one of the greatest coaches in college football history, with a record six national championships and eight SEC championships.\n\n# Early life and education\n\nNick Saban was born on October 31, 1951, in Fairmont, West Virginia, to Nick Sr. and Mary Saban. His father was a coal miner and a football coach, who instilled in him a love for the game from an early age. Saban grew up in a small town, where he played football, basketball, and baseball in high school. He attended Kent State University, where he played defensive back and earned a degree in business administration in 1973. Saban later earned a master's degree in sports administration from Kent State in 1976.\n\n# Coaching career\n\n## Early coaching career\n\nSaban began his coaching career as a graduate assistant at Kent State in 1973. He then moved to Syracuse University, where he served as a defensive backs coach from 1977 to 1979. Saban's first stint in the NFL came in 1979, when he was hired as a defensive backs coach for the New York Giants. He spent two seasons with the Giants before moving to the Detroit Lions, where he served as a defensive backs coach from 1981 to 1983.\n\n## Toledo\n\nIn 1990, Saban became the head coach at the University of Toledo, where he spent one season. During his tenure, the Rockets compiled a 9-13 record, but Saban's defensive expertise helped the team improve its defensive ranking from 99th to 27th in the nation.\n\n## Cleveland Browns\n\nSaban's NFL coaching career resumed in 1991, when he was hired as the defensive coordinator for the Cleveland Browns. He spent four seasons with the Browns, helping the team reach the playoffs twice.\n\n## Michigan State\n\nIn 1995, Saban became the head coach at Michigan State University, where he spent five seasons.

The storm caused widespread damage and disruption, particularly in the northeastern United States and eastern Canada.\n\n# Meteorological history\n\nHurricane Lee formed on September 1, 2023, from a tropical wave that had emerged from the coast of Africa several days earlier. The system gradually organized as it moved westward across the tropical Atlantic, and by September 3, it had developed into a tropical depression. The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Lee later that day, and continued to intensify as it turned northward towards the Bahamas.\n\nLee became a hurricane on September 5, with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (120 km/h). The storm then underwent rapid intensification, with winds increasing by 40 mph (65 km/h) in just 24 hours. By September 7, Lee had reached Category 4 strength, with winds of 140 mph (225 km/h) and a central pressure of 955 mbar (28.20 inHg).\n\n# Preparations and impact\n\n## Bermuda\n\nLee passed close to Bermuda on September 6, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall to the island. A hurricane warning was issued for the island, and residents were advised to take necessary precautions to protect themselves and their property. The storm caused significant damage, particularly to buildings and infrastructure, with estimated losses totaling $100 million.\n\n## United States\n\n### New York\n\nLee made landfall in Long Island, New York, on September 8, as a Category 3 hurricane.

The storm also caused significant disruption to transportation, with many roads and bridges closed due to flooding.\n\n### Massachusetts\n\nLee brought strong winds and heavy rainfall to Massachusetts, particularly in the eastern part of the state. The storm caused significant damage, particularly to buildings and infrastructure, with estimated losses totaling $500 million. Many residents were left without power, and several communities were affected by flooding.\n\n### Rhode Island\n\nRhode Island was also affected by Lee, with strong winds and heavy rainfall causing significant damage. The storm caused widespread power outages, and many residents were left without electricity for several days. The state's coastal communities were particularly affected, with many homes and buildings damaged or destroyed.\n\n### New Hampshire\n\nLee brought strong winds and heavy rainfall to New Hampshire, particularly in the southern part of the state. The storm caused significant damage, particularly to buildings and infrastructure, with estimated losses totaling $200 million. Many residents were left without power, and several communities were affected by flooding.\n\n### Maine\n\nMaine was also affected by Lee, with strong winds and heavy rainfall causing significant damage. The storm caused widespread power outages, and many residents were left without electricity for several days. The state's coastal communities were particularly affected, with many homes and buildings damaged or destroyed.\n\n## Canada\n\n### New Brunswick\n\nLee brought strong winds and heavy rainfall to New Brunswick, particularly in the southern part of the province. The storm caused significant damage, particularly to buildings and infrastructure, with estimated losses totaling $300 million. Many residents were left without power, and several communities were affected by flooding.\n\n### Nova Scotia\n\nNova Scotia was also affected by Lee, with strong winds and heavy rainfall causing significant damage.

With a history spanning over 150 years, the family has played a crucial role in shaping Sweden's industrial landscape and has produced several notable individuals who have made lasting impacts in various fields.\n\n# History\n\n## Early Years\n\nThe Wallenberg family's history dates back to the 19th century when André Oscar Wallenberg, a Swedish diplomat and politician, founded Enskilda Banken in 1856. The bank would eventually become the cornerstone of the family's business empire. André's son, Knut Agathon Wallenberg, took over the bank in 1886 and expanded its operations, laying the foundation for the family's future success.\n\n## Industrialization and Expansion\n\nDuring the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Wallenberg family invested heavily in various industries, including steel, mining, and forestry. They acquired controlling stakes in several companies, including the Swedish Match Company, the Swedish Steel Company, and the Stora Kopparberg mining company. This expansion helped establish the family as one of Sweden's most influential industrial dynasties.\n\n## World War II and the Neutral Sweden\n\nDuring World War II, the Wallenberg family played a significant role in maintaining Sweden's neutrality. Jacob Wallenberg, the grandson of André Oscar Wallenberg, served as a special envoy to the Swedish government and helped negotiate the country's relations with both the Axis and Allied powers. The family's efforts helped keep Sweden out of the war, and their businesses continued to operate despite the challenging economic conditions.\n\n# Modern Business\n\n## Investor AB and the Family's Holding Company\n\nIn 1916, the Wallenberg family founded Investor AB, a holding company that would eventually become the vehicle for their business interests. Investor AB is still one of the largest shareholders in several Swedish companies, including Ericsson, AstraZeneca, and Electrolux. The company is controlled by the Wallenberg family through a complex network of holding companies and trusts.\n\n## Diversification and Globalization\n\nIn recent decades, the Wallenberg family has diversified their business interests, investing in various sectors such as technology, healthcare, and finance. They have also expanded their operations globally, with investments in companies across Europe, Asia, and the Americas. The family's business empire is now a complex web of companies, holding companies, and investments that span multiple continents.\n\n## Sustainability and Philanthropy\n\nThe Wallenberg family has a long tradition of philanthropy and has been actively involved in various charitable initiatives over the years. The Wallenberg Foundations, established in 1917, support research and education in Sweden, with a particular focus on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). The family has also been a vocal advocate for sustainability and environmental protection, with several family members actively involved in initiatives to reduce carbon emissions and promote renewable energy.\n\n# Notable Family Members\n\n## André Oscar Wallenberg\n\nAndré Oscar Wallenberg (1816-1886) was the founder of Enskilda Banken and the patriarch of the Wallenberg family. He was a Swedish diplomat and politician who served as the Swedish ambassador to the United Kingdom and later became the Minister of Foreign Affairs.\n\n## Knut Agathon Wallenberg\n\nKnut Agathon Wallenberg (1853-1938) was the son of André Oscar Wallenberg and took over Enskilda Banken in 1886. He expanded the bank's operations and laid the foundation for the family's business empire.\n\n## Jacob Wallenberg\n\nJacob Wallenberg (1892-1980) was the grandson of André Oscar Wallenberg and played a significant role in maintaining Sweden's neutrality during World War II. He served as a special envoy to the Swedish government and helped negotiate the country's relations with both the Axis and Allied powers.\n\n## Marcus Wallenberg\n\nMarcus Wallenberg (1899-1982) was the son of Knut Agathon Wallenberg and served as the chairman of Investor AB from 1956 to 1982. He played a crucial role in the family's business expansion and diversification.\n\n## Peter Wallenberg\n\nPeter Wallenberg (1926-2015) was the son of Marcus Wallenberg and served as the chairman of Investor AB from 1982 to 1999. He was a prominent businessman and philanthropist who was instrumental in the family's efforts to promote sustainability and environmental protection.\n\n## Jacob Wallenberg (born 1956)\n\nJacob Wallenberg (born 1956) is the son of Peter Wallenberg and serves as the current chairman of Investor AB. He has been instrumental in the family's efforts to diversify their business interests and expand their operations globally.\n\n# References\n\n# External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Wallenberg_family\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n#Modern business\n#Notable family members\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born on July 22, 1917, in Bucharest, Romania, Rădulescu's life was marked by a complex and often contradictory trajectory, reflecting the tumultuous times in which he lived.\n\n#Biography\n\n##Early life and FSD\n\nRădulescu's early life was marked by a strong interest in literature and politics. He studied law and literature at the University of Bucharest, where he became involved with the left-wing student movement. In 1939, he joined the Romanian Communist Party, which was then an underground organization. During World War II, Rădulescu participated in the anti-fascist resistance, working closely with other communist leaders, including Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, who would later become the General Secretary of the Romanian Communist Party.\n\nAfter the war, Rădulescu became a key figure in the Romanian Writers' Union, where he promoted socialist realism and advocated for the role of literature in shaping the country's new socialist identity. In 1948, he was appointed as the editor-in-chief of the literary magazine _Viața Românească_ (Romanian Life), which became a platform for promoting socialist literature and ideology.\n\n##Wartime desertion and return\n\nIn 1944, Rădulescu was drafted into the Romanian Army and fought on the Eastern Front. However, in 1945, he deserted and joined the Soviet forces, where he worked as a translator and propagandist. This decision would later have significant consequences for his career and reputation.\n\nAfter the war, Rădulescu returned to Romania and rejoined the communist party. He quickly rose through the ranks, becoming a member of the Central Committee and a key advisor to Gheorghiu-Dej. However, his wartime desertion and collaboration with the Soviet forces would remain a sensitive topic, and he would face criticism and skepticism from some of his colleagues.\n\n##1952 fall and 1956 recovery\n\nIn 1952, Rădulescu fell out of favor with Gheorghiu-Dej, who had become increasingly paranoid and suspicious of potential rivals. Rădulescu was accused of being a \"bourgeois nationalist\" and was removed from his position as editor-in-chief of _Viața Românească_. He was also expelled from the Central Committee and forced to undergo a period of self-criticism.\n\nHowever, in 1956, Rădulescu was rehabilitated and returned to his position as editor-in-chief of _Viața Românească_. This was largely due to the efforts of Gheorghiu-Dej's successor, Nicolae Ceaușescu, who saw Rădulescu as a valuable ally and a key figure in promoting Romanian culture and ideology.\n\n##With Ceaușescu\n\nRădulescu's relationship with Ceaușescu was complex and multifaceted. On the one hand, he was a key advisor and confidant to the Romanian leader, and he played a significant role in shaping the country's cultural and ideological policies. On the other hand, he was also a vocal critic of Ceaușescu's increasingly authoritarian and repressive tendencies.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, Rădulescu became a key figure in promoting Romanian nationalism and protochronism, a movement that emphasized the country's unique cultural and historical heritage. He also played a significant role in promoting the work of Romanian writers and artists, and he was a vocal advocate for greater cultural and artistic freedom.\n\n##Patronage and liberalism\n\nRădulescu's patronage of Romanian writers and artists was a key aspect of his career and legacy. He was a vocal supporter of many young and talented writers, including the poet and novelist Mircea Cărtărescu, and he played a significant role in promoting their work.\n\nHowever, Rădulescu's liberalism and advocacy for greater cultural and artistic freedom also put him at odds with the increasingly repressive Ceaușescu regime. In the 1980s, he became a vocal critic of the regime's censorship and repression of dissenting voices, and he was forced to undergo a period of self-criticism and reeducation.\n\n##Protochronism and austerity debates\n\nRădulescu's involvement in the protochronism movement was a significant aspect of his career and legacy. He was a vocal advocate for the idea that Romanian culture and history were unique and distinct from those of other European countries, and he played a significant role in promoting this idea through his writing and teaching.\n\nHowever, Rădulescu's protochronism was also criticized by some as being overly nationalist and xenophobic. He was accused of promoting a narrow and exclusive view of Romanian identity, and of ignoring the country's complex and multicultural heritage.\n\n##Downfall, prosecution, and death\n\nIn 1989, Rădulescu was arrested and charged with \"anti-state activities\" and \"slander against the Romanian state and its leaders.\" He was subjected to a show trial, and he was sentenced to 15 years in prison.\n\nHowever, in December 1989, Ceaușescu was overthrown, and Rădulescu was released from prison. He died on July 22, 1991, at the age of 74, due to complications from a heart condition.\n\n#Legacy\n\nGogu Rădulescu's legacy is complex and multifaceted. On the one hand, he was a key figure in promoting Romanian culture and ideology, and he played a significant role in shaping the country's cultural and artistic landscape. On the other hand, he was also a vocal critic of the Ceaușescu regime's authoritarian and repressive tendencies, and he was forced to undergo a period of self-criticism and reeducation.\n\nRădulescu's protochronism and advocacy for greater cultural and artistic freedom also had a significant impact on Romanian thought and culture. However, his narrow and exclusive view of Romanian identity was also criticized by some as being overly nationalist and xenophobic.\n\nOverall, Rădulescu's legacy is a complex and nuanced one, reflecting the tumultuous times in which he lived. He was a key figure in Romanian cultural and intellectual life, and his work and legacy continue to be studied and debated by scholars and intellectuals today.\n\n#Notes\n\n#References", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Gogu_Rădulescu\" following this outline:\n\n#Biography\n##Early life and FSD\n##Wartime desertion and return\n##1952 fall and 1956 recovery\n##With Ceaușescu\n##Patronage and liberalism\n##Protochronism and austerity debates\n##Downfall, prosecution, and death\n#Legacy\n#Notes\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

While the early Crusades are well-documented, the later Crusades are often less well-known. This article aims to provide a comprehensive chronology of the later Crusades, focusing on the events of the 13th to 15th centuries.\n\n# Chronologies of the Crusades in print\n\nPrior to the modern era, there were limited written accounts of the Crusades. The earliest written records of the Crusades were primarily composed by Christian authors, such as William of Tyre and Jacques de Vitry. However, these accounts were often biased and incomplete. It wasn't until the 19th century that historians began to compile comprehensive chronologies of the Crusades. One of the earliest and most influential chronologies was written by the French historian Joseph François Michaud, who published his \"History of the Crusades\" in 1812. Michaud's work was followed by other notable historians, such as Steven Runciman and Jonathan Riley-Smith, who have continued to refine and expand our understanding of the Crusades.\n\n# 13th century\n\n## Prior events\n\nThe 13th century marked a significant turning point in the history of the Crusades. The Fourth Crusade, which ended in 1204, had resulted in the sack of Constantinople and the establishment of the Latin Empire. However, this victory was short-lived, as the Latin Empire was eventually overthrown by the Byzantine Empire in 1261. Meanwhile, the Ayyubid dynasty had risen to power in Egypt, and the Mamluk Sultanate had established itself as a major force in the region.\n\n## 1270\n\nIn 1270, King Louis IX of France launched the Eighth Crusade, which was directed against the city of Tunis in North Africa. The Crusade was sparked by Louis's desire to convert the Muslim ruler of Tunis to Christianity. However, the Crusade was ultimately unsuccessful, as Louis died of dysentery in August 1270. The Crusade was then abandoned, and the remaining troops returned to France.\n\n## 1280\n\nIn 1280, the Mamluk Sultanate, led by Sultan Qalawun, launched a successful campaign against the Crusader state of Tripoli. The city was besieged and eventually fell to the Mamluks in April 1289. The fall of Tripoli marked a significant blow to the Crusader states, as it left only a handful of cities under Christian control.\n\n## 1290\n\nIn 1290, King Edward I of England launched a Crusade against the Mamluk Sultanate. The Crusade was sparked by Edward's desire to recapture the city of Jerusalem, which had fallen to the Mamluks in 1244. However, the Crusade was ultimately unsuccessful, as Edward's forces were defeated at the Battle of Al Mansurah in February 1250. Edward was forced to negotiate a treaty with the Mamluks, which allowed him to maintain control over a small portion of the Crusader states.\n\n# 14th century\n\n## 1300\n\nIn 1300, Pope Boniface VIII called for a new Crusade against the Mamluk Sultanate. The Crusade was sparked by Boniface's desire to recapture the city of Jerusalem and to assert papal authority over the Holy Land. However, the Crusade was ultimately unsuccessful, as the Mamluks were able to defend their territories against the Crusader armies.\n\n## 1310\n\nIn 1310, the Knights Hospitaller, a military order founded in the 11th century, launched a successful campaign against the island of Rhodes. The island was captured by the Hospitallers in August 1310, and it remained under their control until the 16th century.\n\n## 1320\n\nIn 1320, the Mamluk Sultanate, led by Sultan Al-Nasir Muhammad, launched a successful campaign against the Crusader state of Armenia. The kingdom was besieged and eventually fell to the Mamluks in April 1375. The fall of Armenia marked a significant blow to the Crusader states, as it left only a handful of cities under Christian control.\n\n## 1330\n\nIn 1330, Pope John XXII called for a new Crusade against the Mamluk Sultanate. The Crusade was sparked by John's desire to recapture the city of Jerusalem and to assert papal authority over the Holy Land. However, the Crusade was ultimately unsuccessful, as the Mamluks were able to defend their territories against the Crusader armies.\n\n## 1340\n\nIn 1340, the Black Death, a pandemic that had originated in Central Asia, reached Europe. The plague had a devastating impact on European society, as it killed an estimated 75 to 200 million people. The plague also had a significant impact on the Crusades, as it led to a decline in the number of Crusaders and a decrease in the resources available for the Crusades.\n\n## 1350\n\nIn 1350, the Mamluk Sultanate, led by Sultan Al-Nasir Hasan, launched a successful campaign against the Crusader state of Antioch. The city was besieged and eventually fell to the Mamluks in March 1268. The fall of Antioch marked a significant blow to the Crusader states, as it left only a handful of cities under Christian control.\n\n## 1360\n\nIn 1360, the Knights Hospitaller, led by Grand Master Raymond Berenger, launched a successful campaign against the island of Cyprus. The island was captured by the Hospitallers in October 1360, and it remained under their control until the 16th century.\n\n## 1370\n\nIn 1370, the Mamluk Sultanate, led by Sultan Al-Ashraf Sha'ban, launched a successful campaign against the Crusader state of Tripoli. The city was besieged and eventually fell to the Mamluks in April 1389. The fall of Tripoli marked a significant blow to the Crusader states, as it left only a handful of cities under Christian control.\n\n## 1380\n\nIn 1380, the Ottoman Empire, led by Sultan Murad I, launched a successful campaign against the Byzantine Empire.

The queue was formed to allow members of the public to view the Queen's coffin as it lay in state at Westminster Hall in London. The queue was a significant event in British history, with hundreds of thousands of people waiting for hours, and in some cases, overnight, to pay their respects.\n\n# Precedents\n\nThe queue for the lying-in-state of Elizabeth II was not the first time that the British public had gathered to pay their respects to a deceased monarch. In 1901, a large crowd gathered to pay their respects to Queen Victoria as she lay in state at Westminster Hall. Similarly, in 1952, thousands of people queued to pay their respects to King George VI as he lay in state at Westminster Hall.\n\nHowever, the queue for Elizabeth II's lying-in-state was unique in its scale and duration. The queue stretched for miles, with some estimates suggesting that it reached as far as 10 miles at its peak. The queue also lasted for several days, with some people waiting for over 24 hours to pay their respects.\n\n# Routes\n\nThe queue for the lying-in-state of Elizabeth II followed a designated route through the streets of London. The route was designed to allow the maximum number of people to pay their respects while also ensuring public safety.\n\n## Main queue\n\nThe main queue started at the Albert Embankment, a pedestrian walkway along the south bank of the River Thames. From there, it wound its way through the streets of London, passing by several landmarks, including the Houses of Parliament and Westminster Bridge. The queue then turned into Westminster Hall, where the Queen's coffin lay in state.\n\n## Accessible queue\n\nIn addition to the main queue, an accessible queue was provided for people with disabilities. This queue started at a separate location and followed a shorter route to Westminster Hall. The accessible queue was designed to reduce the waiting time for people with disabilities, who may have found it difficult to wait for extended periods in the main queue.\n\n# Length\n\nThe length of the queue for the lying-in-state of Elizabeth II was a major challenge for the organizers. At its peak, the queue stretched for over 10 miles, with some estimates suggesting that it reached as far as 14 miles. The queue was so long that it took some people over 24 hours to reach the front.\n\nTo put the length of the queue into perspective, it is worth noting that the queue for the lying-in-state of Princess Diana in 1997, which was also held at Westminster Hall, reached a length of around 5 miles. The queue for Elizabeth II's lying-in-state was therefore significantly longer than the queue for Princess Diana's lying-in-state.\n\n# Organisation\n\nThe organisation of the queue for the lying-in-state of Elizabeth II was a major logistical challenge. The queue was managed by the Metropolitan Police Service, with assistance from other emergency services and volunteers.\n\nTo manage the queue, a system of wristbands was used. Each person in the queue was given a wristband, which indicated their position in the queue. The wristbands were color-coded, with each color representing a different section of the queue.\n\nIn addition to the wristband system, a number of other measures were put in place to manage the queue. These included the provision of food and drink, as well as toilets and first aid facilities.\n\n## Exemptions from queuing\n\nWhile most people were required to queue to pay their respects, there were some exemptions. These included members of the royal family, politicians, and other dignitaries, who were able to access the lying-in-state through a separate entrance.\n\nAdditionally, some people were exempt from queuing due to their role in the lying-in-state. These included the clergy, who were involved in the service, and the pallbearers, who were responsible for carrying the Queen's coffin.\n\n# Participation and incidents\n\nThe queue for the lying-in-state of Elizabeth II was a major event, with hundreds of thousands of people participating. While the vast majority of people queued peacefully, there were some incidents.\n\nOne of the most significant incidents occurred when a man was arrested for allegedly trying to touch the Queen's coffin. The man, who was later charged with a public order offense, was reported to have jumped out of the queue and attempted to touch the coffin.\n\nIn addition to this incident, there were reports of some people becoming unwell while queuing. In some cases, people were treated by medical staff, while others were taken to hospital.\n\n# Responses and media coverage\n\nThe queue for the lying-in-state of Elizabeth II received widespread media coverage, with many newspapers and television stations covering the event.\n\nThe response to the queue was overwhelmingly positive, with many people expressing their admiration for the Queen and their gratitude for the opportunity to pay their respects.\n\nHowever, some people expressed criticism of the queue, with some arguing that it was too long and that the waiting time was excessive.\n\n# References\n\n[Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements]\n\n# External links\n\n[Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements]", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Queue_for_the_lying-in-state_of_Elizabeth_II\" following this outline:\n\n#Precedents\n#Routes\n##Main queue\n##Accessible queue\n#Length\n#Organisation\n##Exemptions from queuing\n#Participation and incidents\n#Responses and media coverage\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Davis restructuring\n##Headquarters\n#See also\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Gulf and Western Industries\n==========================\n\nGulf and Western Industries was a conglomerate that operated from the 1930s to the 1980s. The company was formed through the merger of several businesses and went on to become one of the largest conglomerates in the United States. At its peak, Gulf and Western Industries had a diverse portfolio of companies operating in various industries, including manufacturing, finance, and entertainment.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### Bluhdorn period\n\nGulf and Western Industries was formed in 1934 through the merger of the Gulf and Western Railway Company and the Western Industries Corporation. However, it was not until the 1950s that the company began to expand its operations under the leadership of Charles Bluhdorn. Bluhdorn, an Austrian-born businessman, became the president of Gulf and Western in 1958 and quickly set about acquiring new companies and expanding the business.\n\nDuring the Bluhdorn period, Gulf and Western Industries made several significant acquisitions, including the purchase of the Studebaker-Packard Corporation in 1954 and the Paramount Pictures film studio in 1966. The company also expanded its operations into new industries, such as finance and real estate. By the late 1960s, Gulf and Western Industries had become one of the largest conglomerates in the United States, with a diverse portfolio of companies operating in various industries.\n\n### Early 1980s\n\nIn the early 1980s, Gulf and Western Industries began to experience financial difficulties. The company's debt had grown significantly as a result of its aggressive expansion strategy, and it was struggling to meet its financial obligations. In 1981, the company reported a net loss of $225 million, and its stock price fell by more than 50%.\n\nIn an effort to address its financial difficulties, Gulf and Western Industries began to sell off some of its assets. The company sold its Studebaker-Packard Corporation to a group of investors in 1981 and its Paramount Pictures film studio to a consortium of investors in 1983.\n\n### Martin S. Davis restructuring\n\nIn 1983, Martin S. Davis became the president and CEO of Gulf and Western Industries. Davis, a former investment banker, was brought in to restructure the company and restore its financial health.\n\nUnder Davis' leadership, Gulf and Western Industries underwent a significant restructuring. The company sold off many of its non-core assets, including its real estate and finance businesses, and focused on its core industries, such as manufacturing and entertainment.\n\nThe restructuring effort was successful, and Gulf and Western Industries was able to restore its financial health. However, the company was significantly smaller than it had been during its peak in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n### Headquarters\n\nGulf and Western Industries was headquartered in New York City. The company's headquarters was located in the Paramount Communications Building, which was also the headquarters of Paramount Pictures.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Paramount Pictures\n* Studebaker-Packard Corporation\n* Conglomerate\n* Diversification (business)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Gulf_and_Western_Industries\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Bluhdorn period\n##Early 1980s\n##Martin S.
