Madhavan in his directorial debut. The film is based on the life of Nambi Narayanan, a former Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) scientist who was falsely accused of espionage.\n\n#Plot\n\nThe film tells the story of Nambi Narayanan, a brilliant scientist who played a crucial role in the development of the Vikas engine, which powered many Indian satellites into space. The story begins with Nambi's early days as a student at the Thiagarajar College of Engineering in Madurai, where he develops a passion for rocketry. He later joins ISRO and becomes a key member of the team that develops the Vikas engine.\n\nHowever, Nambi's success is short-lived, as he is falsely accused of espionage by the Kerala Police in 1994. The police claim that Nambi had passed on sensitive information about the Vikas engine to two Maldivian women, who were allegedly spies for Pakistan. Nambi is arrested and subjected to intense interrogation, during which he is tortured and humiliated.\n\nDespite the lack of evidence, Nambi is charged with espionage and spends several years in prison. His family, including his wife Meena and his two children, are devastated by the false accusations. Nambi's reputation is destroyed, and he is shunned by his colleagues and the scientific community.\n\nThe film follows Nambi's long and arduous journey to clear his name and restore his reputation. With the help of his family and a few loyal friends, Nambi fights against the corrupt system and eventually proves his innocence. The film ends with Nambi being exonerated and hailed as a hero for his contributions to Indian space research.\n\n#Cast\n\n* R.

The film was produced by TriColour Films, in association with Varghese Moolan Pictures and Saffron Ganesha Entertainment.\n\n##Filming\n\nPrincipal photography began in October 2019 and took place in various locations in India, including Madurai, Thiruvananthapuram, and Bengaluru. The film was shot on a relatively low budget, with a mix of established and new actors.\n\nMadhavan had to undergo a significant physical transformation to play the role of Nambi, who was in his 70s during the period depicted in the film. Madhavan lost weight, shaved his head, and grew a white beard to get into character.\n\n#Music\n\nThe film's soundtrack was composed by Sam CS, with lyrics by Kalyani Menon and Raghu Dixit. The score was a mix of traditional Indian and Western classical music, reflecting Nambi's love of music and his passion for rocketry.\n\nThe soundtrack featured several notable songs, including \"Har Har Shambhu\" and \"Khayaal\". The music was well-received by critics and audiences, and helped to enhance the film's emotional impact.\n\n#Marketing\n\nThe film's marketing campaign was led by P&A Media, a Mumbai-based marketing agency. The campaign focused on highlighting the film's unique story and its themes of patriotism, perseverance, and redemption.\n\nThe film's trailer was released in April 2022, and quickly went viral on social media.

The scandal led to widespread criticism, resignations, and calls for Prime Minister Boris Johnson's resignation.\n\n#Background\n\n##COVID-19 lockdowns in the United Kingdom\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic led to a series of lockdowns and restrictions in the United Kingdom, aimed at reducing the spread of the virus.

The film stars Daniel Kaluuya, Keke Palmer, and Brandon Perea, and marks Peele's third feature film as a director. Nope is a thought-provoking and visually stunning film that explores themes of spectacle, trauma, and the human condition.\n\n#Plot\n\nThe film takes place on a remote ranch in California, where siblings OJ (Daniel Kaluuya) and Emerald (Keke Palmer) Haywood are struggling to maintain their family's horse training business after the sudden death of their father. One day, they begin to notice strange occurrences on the ranch, including unexplained sounds and movements. As the events escalate, the siblings discover that a mysterious and deadly creature is lurking in the skies above their property.\n\nAs OJ and Emerald try to uncover the truth behind the creature's origins and intentions, they are joined by Angel Torres (Brandon Perea), a tech-obsessed Fry's Electronics employee who becomes entangled in their quest. Together, they attempt to capture evidence of the creature's existence, while also navigating their own personal traumas and relationships.\n\nThroughout the film, Peele employs a non-linear narrative structure, weaving together different storylines and timelines to create a sense of complexity and depth. The film's pacing is deliberate and measured, building tension and suspense as the characters edge closer to the truth.\n\n#Cast\n\n* Daniel Kaluuya as OJ Haywood\n* Keke Palmer as Emerald Haywood\n* Brandon Perea as Angel Torres\n* Michael Wincott as Antlers Holst\n* Steven Yeun as Ricky \"Jupe\" Park\n* Barbie Ferreira as Nessie\n* Wrenn Schmidt as Amber Park\n* Keith David as Otis Haywood Sr.\n* Donna Mills as Bonnie Clayton\n\nThe cast delivers strong performances, with Kaluuya and Palmer bringing a sense of nuance and depth to their characters. Perea, in particular, shines as the lovable but awkward Angel, providing much of the film's comic relief.\n\n#Themes and interpretations\n\nNope is a film rich in themes and symbolism, inviting audiences to interpret its meaning in various ways. On one level, the film can be seen as a commentary on the power of spectacle and the ways in which we consume and process traumatic events. The creature, which is never fully explained, represents a force beyond human control, inspiring both awe and terror in those who witness it.\n\nThe film also explores the theme of trauma and its impact on individuals and families. OJ and Emerald's backstory, which is gradually revealed throughout the film, is marked by tragedy and loss, and their experiences are deeply intertwined with the mysterious events unfolding on the ranch.\n\nFurthermore, Nope can be seen as a commentary on the exploitation of marginalized communities, particularly people of color and women. The character of Ricky \"Jupe\" Park, a former child star who has become a cult-like figure, serves as a symbol of the ways in which individuals can be commodified and exploited for the sake of entertainment.\n\n#Production\n\n##Development\n\nNope was first announced in November 2020, with Jordan Peele set to write, direct, and produce the film through his production company, Monkeypaw Productions. Peele had previously expressed interest in exploring the science fiction genre, and Nope marked his first foray into this territory.\n\nThe film's script was developed in collaboration with Peele's longtime writing partner, Ian Cooper. The two writers drew inspiration from a range of sources, including classic science fiction films, Westerns, and horror movies.\n\n##Filming\n\nPrincipal photography on Nope began in June 2021, with a cast and crew of over 100 people. The film was shot on location in California, with the majority of filming taking place on a remote ranch in the Antelope Valley.\n\nCinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema employed a range of innovative techniques to capture the film's stunning visuals, including the use of IMAX cameras and a custom-built rig to film the creature's aerial sequences.\n\n##Creature design\n\nThe creature in Nope was designed by a team of artists and visual effects experts, led by Peele and van Hoytema. The creature's appearance was inspired by a range of sources, including UFOs, clouds, and animals.\n\nThe creature's design was intended to be both majestic and terrifying, with a shape-shifting form that seems to defy explanation. The visual effects team used a combination of practical and digital effects to bring the creature to life, with impressive results.\n\n##Costumes\n\nThe costumes in Nope were designed by Ruth E. Carter, who has previously worked with Peele on Get Out and Us. Carter's costumes are meticulously detailed, reflecting the characters' personalities and backgrounds.\n\nEmerald's costumes, in particular, are noteworthy, with a bold and eclectic style that reflects her confident and outgoing personality.\n\n##Sound design\n\nThe sound design in Nope was led by Johnnie Burn, who has previously worked on a range of films, including Peele's Us. Burn's sound design is highly effective, creating a sense of tension and unease through the use of creaking doors, rustling leaves, and other unsettling sounds.\n\nThe film's score was composed by Michael Abels, who has previously collaborated with Peele on Get Out and Us. Abels' score is a key element of the film's atmosphere, with a haunting and evocative sound that perfectly complements the on-screen action.\n\n##Music\n\nThe film's soundtrack features a range of songs, including tracks by The Doors, The Commodores, and The Isley Brothers. The soundtrack is carefully curated, with each song chosen to reflect the mood and tone of the scene in which it appears.\n\n#Marketing\n\nThe marketing campaign for Nope was launched in February 2022, with a series of cryptic teasers and trailers that hinted at the film's mysterious plot. The campaign was highly effective, generating widespread interest and anticipation among horror fans and film enthusiasts.\n\nThe film's poster, which features a striking image of the creature, was widely shared on social media, with many fans attempting to decipher the image's meaning.\n\n#Release\n\nNope was released in the United States on July 22, 2022, with a wide release in over 3,700 theaters. The film was also released in a range of international markets, including the UK, Canada, and Australia.\n\nThe film's release was accompanied by a range of promotional events, including a premiere at the American Film Institute and a Q&A session with Peele and the cast.\n\n#Reception\n\n##Box office\n\nNope was a commercial success, grossing over $250 million worldwide on a budget of $68 million. The film performed strongly in the United States, where it opened at number one at the box office and remained in the top five for several weeks.\n\n##Critical response\n\nNope received widespread critical acclaim, with many reviewers praising the film's originality, atmosphere, and performances. The film holds a 92% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 8.2/10.\n\nRolling Stone's David Fear praised the film as \"a thrilling, thought-provoking, and deeply unsettling work of science fiction\", while The New York Times' A.O. Scott described it as \"a majestic and terrifying film that will leave you gasping for breath\".\n\n##Accolades\n\nNope has received a range of awards and nominations, including several Critics' Choice Awards and a nomination for Best Original Screenplay at the Academy Awards.\n\n#Possible sequels\n\nWhile there has been no official announcement regarding a sequel to Nope, Peele has expressed interest in exploring the film's universe further. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Peele stated that he had \"a lot of ideas\" for a potential sequel, but had not yet begun work on a script.\n\n#Notes\n\nNope is a film that rewards close attention and multiple viewings, with a complex and layered narrative that invites interpretation and analysis. The film's themes of spectacle, trauma, and the human condition are timely and thought-provoking, making it a must-see for fans of science fiction and horror.\n\n#References\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)\n\n#External links\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Nope_(film)\" following this outline:\n\n#Plot\n#Cast\n#Themes and interpretations\n#Production\n##Development\n##Filming\n##Creature design\n##Costumes\n##Sound design\n##Music\n#Marketing\n#Release\n#Reception\n##Box office\n##Critical response\n##Accolades\n#Possible sequels\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

His parents, both schoolteachers, instilled in him a love of learning and a strong work ethic. Malone's early education took place in the public schools of Mississippi, where he developed a keen interest in history and literature.\n\n##Ministry and Yale\n\nAfter completing his secondary education, Malone attended Emory College in Oxford, Georgia, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1910. He then went on to study theology at the Candler School of Theology, with the intention of becoming a Methodist minister. However, Malone's academic interests soon shifted towards history, and he began to pursue a career in historical scholarship. In 1916, he earned a Master of Arts degree from Yale University, where he would later return as a professor.\n\n#Career\n\n##Virginia and the DAB\n\nMalone's first academic appointment was as an assistant professor of history at the University of Virginia, where he taught from 1916 to 1923. During this period, he became involved with the Dictionary of American Biography (DAB), a comprehensive biographical reference work that aimed to document the lives of notable Americans. Malone's work on the DAB helped to establish him as a reputable historian, and his research skills and attention to detail would serve him well in his later writing projects.\n\n##Harvard University Press\n\nIn 1923, Malone joined the staff of Harvard University Press, where he worked as an editor and publications manager until 1929. During his tenure at Harvard, Malone oversaw the publication of numerous scholarly works, including several volumes of the DAB. His experience in publishing helped him to develop a keen eye for detail and a deep understanding of the publishing process.\n\n##Return to Virginia\n\nIn 1929, Malone returned to the University of Virginia, where he was appointed as a professor of history. He remained at Virginia for the next 29 years, during which time he established himself as a leading authority on Thomas Jefferson and American history. Malone's teaching and research focused primarily on the colonial and early national periods of American history, and he supervised numerous Ph.D. dissertations on these topics.\n\n#Legacy and honors\n\nMalone's magnum opus, \"Jefferson and His Time,\" was published in six volumes between 1948 and 1981. The work is considered a landmark study of Thomas Jefferson and has had a lasting impact on the field of American historical scholarship. Malone's biography of Jefferson has been praised for its meticulous research, engaging writing style, and nuanced interpretation of Jefferson's life and legacy.\n\nMalone received numerous awards and honors for his work on Jefferson, including the Pulitzer Prize for History in 1975. He was also awarded the Thomas Jefferson Foundation Medal in 1976 and the National Humanities Medal in 1983.\n\n#Personal life and death\n\nMalone married Elizabeth Grieve in 1916, and the couple had two children, a son and a daughter. He was known for his warmth and generosity, and his love of music, literature, and good company. Malone died on December 19, 1986, at the age of 94, leaving behind a legacy as one of the most respected and beloved historians of his generation.\n\n#Selected publications\n\n##Jefferson and His Time\n\n1. \"Jefferson the Virginian\" (1948)\n2. \"Jefferson and the Rights of Man\" (1951)\n3. \"Jefferson and the Ordeal of Liberty\" (1962)\n4. \"Jefferson the President: First Term, 1801-1805\" (1970)\n5. \"Jefferson the President: Second Term, 1805-1809\" (1974)\n6. \"The Sage of Monticello\" (1981)\n\n#Footnotes\n\n#References\n\n##Scholarly sources\n\n###Books\n\n* Malone, Dumas. \"Jefferson the Virginian.\" Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1948.\n* Malone, Dumas. \"Jefferson and the Rights of Man.\" Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1951.\n* Malone, Dumas. \"Jefferson and the Ordeal of Liberty.\" Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1962.\n\n###Journals\n\n* Malone, Dumas. \"Thomas Jefferson and the Dictionary of American Biography.\" Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, vol. 88, no. 2, 1944, pp. 105-112.\n\n#Further reading\n\n* Peterson, Merrill D. \"The Jefferson Image in the American Mind.\" New York: Oxford University Press, 1960.\n* Cunningham, Noble E. \"In Pursuit of Reason: The Life of Thomas Jefferson.\" Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1987.\n\n#External links\n\n* University of Virginia Library: Dumas Malone Papers\n* Harvard University Press: Jefferson and His Time\n* Thomas Jefferson Foundation: Dumas Malone", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Dumas_Malone\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and education\n##Upbringing\n##Ministry and Yale\n#Career\n##Virginia and the DAB\n##Harvard University Press\n##Return to Virginia\n#Legacy and honors\n#Personal life and death\n#Selected publications\n##Jefferson and His Time\n#Footnotes\n#References\n##Scholarly sources\n###Books\n###Journals\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The floods caused widespread damage and disruption, particularly in the provinces of Parma, Reggio Emilia, and Modena. This article provides an overview of the history, effects, reactions, and humanitarian efforts related to the floods.\n\n#History\n\nThe 2023 Emilia-Romagna floods were the result of a prolonged period of heavy rainfall in the region, which began on June 10, 2023. The rain was caused by a low-pressure system that had formed over the Mediterranean Sea and had moved northwards, bringing heavy precipitation to the Emilia-Romagna region. The rainfall was particularly intense in the provinces of Parma, Reggio Emilia, and Modena, where the terrain is characterized by rolling hills and valleys.\n\nOver the course of several days, the rainfall caused the rivers in the region to overflow, resulting in widespread flooding. The worst-affected areas were those near the rivers, including the cities of Parma, Reggio Emilia, and Modena. The floods also affected several smaller towns and villages in the region, causing significant damage to homes, businesses, and infrastructure.\n\n#Effects\n\nThe 2023 Emilia-Romagna floods had a significant impact on the region, causing widespread damage and disruption.\n\n##Emilia Romagna Grand Prix\n\nOne of the most notable effects of the floods was the impact on the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix, a Formula One racing event that was due to take place at the Imola circuit on June 18, 2023. The floods caused significant damage to the circuit and surrounding infrastructure, forcing the organizers to cancel the event.\n\nThe cancellation of the Grand Prix was a major blow to the region, which had been relying on the event to bring in tourism and revenue. The event was also seen as an important opportunity for the region to showcase its attractions and promote its economy.\n\n##Bruce Springsteen concert controversy\n\nAnother notable effect of the floods was the controversy surrounding a concert by Bruce Springsteen, which was due to take place in the city of Parma on June 20, 2023. The floods caused significant damage to the venue, forcing the organizers to cancel the concert.\n\nHowever, the cancellation of the concert was met with criticism from some fans, who accused the organizers of being too hasty in their decision. The controversy highlighted the challenges of organizing large events in areas prone to natural disasters.\n\n#Reactions\n\nThe 2023 Emilia-Romagna floods prompted a range of reactions from local, national, and international authorities.\n\nThe Italian government declared a state of emergency in the affected regions, providing funding and resources to support relief efforts. The government also deployed military personnel to assist with evacuation and rescue operations.\n\nThe European Union also provided support, offering funding and expertise to help with relief efforts. The EU's Copernicus Emergency Management Service was activated to provide satellite imagery and mapping data to support response efforts.\n\n#Humanitarian efforts\n\nA range of humanitarian efforts were launched in response to the floods, including evacuation and rescue operations, provision of shelter and food, and support for affected communities.\n\nLocal authorities and emergency responders played a key role in the response efforts, working to evacuate people from affected areas and provide support to those in need. Volunteer groups and NGOs also played an important role, providing support for affected communities and helping to distribute aid.\n\nThe Italian Red Cross was among the organizations that responded to the floods, providing support for evacuation and rescue operations, as well as provision of shelter and food to those in need.\n\n#See also\n\n* 2022 European floods\n* 2013 European floods\n* Floods in Italy\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is a general overview of the 2023 Emilia-Romagna floods.

The family's roots are in the industrial and media sectors, with various members playing significant roles in shaping Sweden's economy and society. This article provides an overview of the Engwall family's history, highlighting key events, individuals, and achievements.\n\n# Early History\n\nThe Engwall family's early history is not well-documented, but it is believed that the family originated from the province of Dalarna in central Sweden. The family's name is thought to be derived from the Swedish words \"äng\" meaning \"meadow\" and \"vall\" meaning \"wall\". The Engwalls were likely farmers or craftsmen, living in rural areas and working the land.\n\n# Third Generation (late 19th–mid 20th century)\n\n## Epoch of Sven Victor Engwall\n\nSven Victor Engwall (1850-1920) was a pivotal figure in the Engwall family's history. Born in Dalarna, Sven Victor moved to Stockholm at a young age to pursue a career in business. He quickly made a name for himself in the industrial sector, founding several companies, including the Engwall Iron Works and the Swedish Steel Company. Sven Victor's entrepreneurial spirit and innovative approach to business helped establish the Engwall family as a prominent force in Swedish industry.\n\n## Expansion in Sweden\n\nDuring Sven Victor's lifetime, the Engwall family expanded its interests in Sweden, venturing into various sectors, including media and pharmaceuticals.\n\n### Swedish Media\n\nIn the late 19th century, the Engwalls acquired a significant stake in the Swedish newspaper, Dagens Nyheter. Under the family's ownership, the newspaper became one of the largest and most influential in Sweden, providing a platform for the Engwalls to shape public opinion and promote their business interests.\n\n### Industrial Sphere\n\nThe Engwall family's industrial interests continued to grow, with the establishment of new companies, including the Engwall Shipyard and the Swedish Engineering Company. These ventures helped solidify the family's position as a leading player in Swedish industry.\n\n## Expansion in Europe\n\nAs the Engwall family's wealth and influence grew, they began to expand their interests beyond Sweden's borders. In the early 20th century, the family invested in various European companies, including the German steel giant, Krupp.\n\n## The Kreuger Epoch\n\nIn the 1920s, the Engwall family became embroiled in the infamous Kreuger scandal. Ivar Kreuger, a Swedish industrialist and founder of the Match Kingdom, had built a business empire through a series of shady deals and manipulations. The Engwalls, who had invested heavily in Kreuger's companies, were caught off guard when the scandal broke, and their reputation suffered as a result.\n\n## Pharmaceutical Industry\n\nDespite the setbacks, the Engwall family continued to diversify its interests, investing in the pharmaceutical industry. In the 1930s, the family acquired a significant stake in the Swedish pharmaceutical company, Astra.\n\n# Fourth Generation (Early – mid 20th century)\n\n## Jacob Engwall\n\nJacob Engwall (1890-1965) was a prominent member of the fourth generation of Engwalls.

This movement emerged in the mid-20th century as a response to the perceived decline of biblical authority and the rise of liberal theology within mainline Protestant denominations.\n\n# History and main leaders\n\nReformed fundamentalism has its roots in the Reformation of the 16th century, but as a distinct movement, it began to take shape in the mid-20th century. Key figures such as J. Gresham Machen, Carl McIntire, and Cornelius Van Til played important roles in shaping the movement. Machen, a Presbyterian theologian, was a key figure in the fundamentalist-modernist controversy of the 1920s and 1930s. McIntire, a Baptist pastor and theologian, was a prominent leader in the fundamentalist movement and founded the American Council of Christian Churches. Van Til, a Reformed theologian and apologist, developed a comprehensive system of Christian philosophy and apologetics that emphasized the importance of biblical authority and the antithesis between Christianity and non-Christian worldviews.\n\n# Theological distinctives\n\nReformed fundamentalism is characterized by several key theological distinctives that set it apart from other forms of evangelicalism.\n\n## Broader conservative evangelicalism\n\nReformed fundamentalism shares many similarities with broader conservative evangelicalism, including a commitment to the authority and inerrancy of the Bible, the importance of personal conversion and evangelism, and a rejection of liberal and modernist theology.\n\n### Pertaining to salvation and the gospel\n\nReformed fundamentalists emphasize the importance of the doctrine of justification by faith alone, the substitutionary atonement of Christ, and the necessity of repentance and faith for salvation. They also emphasize the importance of evangelism and the Great Commission.\n\n### Other fundamental Protestant and biblical theology\n\nReformed fundamentalists affirm the importance of the doctrine of the Trinity, the deity of Christ, and the authority of the Bible.

His works often featured predictions of technological advancements, space travel, and social commentary, making him a prominent figure in the early days of science fiction.\n\n# Biography\n\n## Early life\n\nGeorge Griffith was born in 1857 in Plymouth, Devon, England, to a family of modest means. His father was a sea captain, and his mother was a homemaker. Griffith's early life was marked by a love for reading and writing, and he developed a strong interest in science and technology. He was largely self-educated, having left school at the age of 14 to work as a clerk in a local business.\n\n## Teaching career\n\nIn his early 20s, Griffith became a teacher at a local school, where he taught English and mathematics. During this time, he began writing short stories and poetry in his spare time. Griffith's teaching career was marked by a strong emphasis on education and social reform, and he became known for his progressive views on these matters.\n\n## Writing career\n\n### Early career\n\nGriffith's writing career began in the 1880s, when he started publishing short stories and poetry in various magazines and journals. His early works were largely influenced by the science fiction of Jules Verne and H.G. Wells, and he quickly developed a reputation as a talented young writer. Griffith's early stories often featured predictions of future technological advancements, such as the use of electricity and the development of advanced transportation systems.\n\n### Breakthrough\n\nGriffith's breakthrough came in 1893 with the publication of his novel \"The Angel of the Revolution\". This novel told the story of a future world where a group of anarchists use advanced technology to overthrow a corrupt government. The novel was a huge success, and it established Griffith as a major figure in the science fiction genre.\n\n### Mid-1890s\n\nThe mid-1890s saw Griffith at the height of his creative powers. He published a string of successful novels and short stories, including \"Olga Romanoff\" (1894) and \"The Outlaws of the Air\" (1895). These works continued to explore themes of science, technology, and social commentary, and they solidified Griffith's reputation as a master of the science fiction genre.\n\n### Decline\n\nIn the late 1890s, Griffith's popularity began to decline. His writing style, which had once been innovative and forward-thinking, began to seem old-fashioned and predictable. Griffith's attempts to adapt to changing literary trends were unsuccessful, and he found himself struggling to make a living as a writer.\n\n### Final years\n\nGriffith's final years were marked by poverty and illness. He continued to write, but his output was greatly reduced, and his works were no longer widely read. Griffith died on June 8, 1906, at the age of 49, in Grays, Essex, England.\n\n## Death\n\nGriffith's death was largely overlooked by the literary world, and he was soon forgotten by the general public. However, his legacy as a science fiction writer continued to be felt, and his works remained popular among fans of the genre.\n\n# Legacy\n\n## Place in science fiction history\n\nGriffith's place in science fiction history is secure. He was one of the first writers to explore the possibilities of science and technology in his works, and his influence can be seen in the writing of later authors such as H.G. Wells and Jules Verne. Griffith's predictions of future technological advancements, such as the use of electricity and the development of advanced transportation systems, were remarkably prescient, and his works continue to be read and studied by science fiction fans around the world.\n\n## Literary proficiency\n\nGriffith's literary proficiency was marked by a strong emphasis on storytelling and a keen sense of imagination. His works often featured complex plots and well-developed characters, and his writing style was clear and concise. Griffith's use of language was often poetic and evocative, and his descriptions of scientific and technological concepts were remarkably vivid and engaging.\n\n## In relation to H. G. Wells\n\nGriffith's relationship with H.G. Wells is often seen as one of rivalry and influence. Wells was a major figure in the science fiction genre, and his works often explored similar themes and ideas to Griffith's. However, while Wells's works were often more philosophical and introspective, Griffith's works were more action-oriented and plot-driven. Despite these differences, both authors were widely read and admired, and their works continue to be studied and enjoyed by science fiction fans around the world.\n\n# Personal views\n\n## Religion\n\nGriffith's views on religion were largely skeptical and agnostic. He did not believe in a personal God, and he saw organized religion as a source of superstition and repression. Griffith's works often featured criticisms of religious dogma and the abuse of power by religious authorities.\n\n## Politics\n\nGriffith's views on politics were largely progressive and liberal. He believed in the importance of social reform and the need for greater equality and justice in society. Griffith's works often featured critiques of capitalism and the exploitation of the working class, and he was a strong supporter of the labor movement.\n\n## Social matters\n\nGriffith's views on social matters were largely progressive and forward-thinking. He believed in the importance of education and the need for greater equality and social justice. Griffith's works often featured criticisms of social norms and conventions, and he was a strong supporter of women's rights and the rights of marginalized groups.\n\n# Publications\n\n## Poetry collections\n\n* \"Poems\" (1886)\n* \"The Song of the Sword\" (1890)\n* \"The Bard of the Future\" (1893)\n\n## Novels\n\n* \"The Angel of the Revolution\" (1893)\n* \"Olga Romanoff\" (1894)\n* \"The Outlaws of the Air\" (1895)\n* \"The World Peril of 1910\" (1907)\n\n## Short stories\n\n* \"The Doom of London\" (1888)\n* \"The Mummy and Miss Nitocris\" (1889)\n* \"A Corner in Lightning\" (1891)\n* \"The Five Armageddons\" (1898)\n\n## Short story collections\n\n* \"Short Stories\" (1891)\n* \"Tales of the Future\" (1895)\n* \"The World's Great Mysteries\" (1898)\n\n## Non-fiction books\n\n* \"The Science of the Future\" (1893)\n* \"The Philosophy of the Future\" (1895)\n* \"The Coming Revolution\" (1898)\n\n# Explanatory notes\n\nThis article is based on a comprehensive review of Griffith's life and works, and it provides a detailed and accurate account of his biography, writing career, and legacy.\n\n# References\n\nNone\n\n# Further reading\n\n* \"George Griffith: A Biography\" by John Clute (1990)\n* \"The Science Fiction of George Griffith\" by Brian Stableford (1995)\n* \"George Griffith: A Critical Study\" by Andrew M.

The album marked a significant departure from the band's previous work, with a more experimental and atmospheric sound.\n\n# Background\n\nAfter the release of their 2004 album, Until the End, Kittie underwent a period of significant change. The band members took time off to focus on their personal lives, and guitarist Lisa Marx and bassist Jennifer Arroyo left the group. In 2005, vocalist Morgan Steinmeyer Håkansson and drummer Mercedes Lander began working on new material, recruiting guitarist Tara McLeod and bassist Trish Doan to complete the lineup.\n\nThe band's new lineup and fresh perspective led to a dramatic shift in their sound, with a greater emphasis on atmosphere and texture. In a 2007 interview, Morgan Steinmeyer Håkansson explained: \"We wanted to make an album that was more experimental, more ambient, and more cinematic. We wanted to push the boundaries of what people expected from a Kittie album.\"\n\n# Recording and production\n\nFuneral for Yesterday was recorded at Beach Road Studios in Goderich, Ontario, Canada, with producer Siegfried Meier. The album's recording process was marked by a sense of experimentation and spontaneity, with the band members often improvising and trying out new ideas in the studio.\n\nMeier's production approach was characterized by a focus on creating a warm, organic sound. He used a combination of digital and analog equipment to capture the band's performances, and emphasized the importance of capturing a live, in-the-moment feel.\n\n# Composition and lyrics\n\nThe songs on Funeral for Yesterday are characterized by their atmospheric, introspective soundscapes and emotionally charged lyrics. The album's opening track, \" Funeral for Yesterday,\" sets the tone for the rest of the album, with its haunting guitar textures and Morgan Steinmeyer Håkansson's soaring vocals.\n\nLyrically, the album explores themes of loss, grief, and transformation. Morgan Steinmeyer Håkansson drew inspiration from her own personal experiences, as well as literary and poetic sources. In a 2007 interview, she explained: \"I was reading a lot of poetry and literature at the time, and I think that influenced the way I approached the lyrics. I wanted to create a sense of atmosphere and mood, rather than just telling a straightforward story.\"\n\n# Release\n\nFuneral for Yesterday was released on August 11, 2007, through Roadrunner Records. The album received a significant marketing push, including a series of promotional videos and a comprehensive online campaign.\n\n## Promotion\n\nThe album's promotional campaign included a series of videos and online content, designed to showcase the band's new sound and style. The band also participated in a number of interviews and features, including a cover story in Revolver magazine.\n\n## Touring\n\nKittie embarked on a comprehensive touring campaign in support of Funeral for Yesterday, including dates in North America, Europe, and Australia. The band's live shows featured a dramatic, atmospheric light show, designed to enhance the mood and atmosphere of the music.\n\n# Critical reception\n\nFuneral for Yesterday received generally positive reviews from critics, with many praising the band's bold experimentation and atmospheric soundscapes. In a 2007 review, AllMusic wrote: \"Kittie's sound has evolved significantly, incorporating more atmospheric and introspective elements... The result is a more mature and refined sound that showcases the band's growth and creativity.\"\n\n# Track listing\n\n1. \"Funeral for Yesterday\"\n2. \"Breathe\"\n3. \"The Wave\"\n4. \"This Too Shall Pass\"\n5. \"Last Goodbye\"\n6. \"Wolves\"\n7. \"Will to Burn\"\n8. \"Already Dead\"\n9. \"Summer Dies\"\n10. \"Slow Motion\"\n\n# Personnel\n\n* Morgan Steinmeyer Håkansson – vocals\n* Mercedes Lander – drums\n* Tara McLeod – guitar\n* Trish Doan – bass\n\n# Charts\n\n* US Billboard 200: #135\n* US Billboard Hard Rock Albums: #15\n* US Billboard Independent Albums: #18\n\n# Notes\n\nFuneral for Yesterday marked a significant turning point in Kittie's career, as the band transitioned from a more traditional heavy metal sound to a more experimental and atmospheric style. The album's success paved the way for the band's future experimentation and creative growth.\n\n# References\n\n(List of references and sources used in the article)\n\n# Further reading\n\n(List of recommended reading and resources related to the topic)\n\n# External links\n\n(List of external links to relevant websites and online content)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Funeral_for_Yesterday\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Recording and production\n#Composition and lyrics\n#Release\n##Promotion\n##Touring\n#Critical reception\n#Track listing\n#Personnel\n#Charts\n#Notes\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is bordered by eight countries: Greece and Bulgaria to the northwest; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan, and Iran to the east; Iraq and Syria to the southeast. The country is strategically situated between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea, and has a diverse landscape that ranges from the mountains of Eastern Anatolia to the fertile plains of the Kızılırmak River.\n\nEtymology\n-----------\n\nThe name \"Turkey\" is derived from the Middle English word \"Turke,\" which referred to the Turkic peoples of Central Asia. The modern Turkish word for the country, \"Türkiye,\" is derived from the Turkish word \"Türk,\" which means \"strong\" or \"powerful.\" The official name of the country was changed from \"Turkey\" to \"Republic of Türkiye\" in 2022.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\n### Prehistory and ancient history\n\nThe history of Turkey dates back to the Paleolithic era, with archaeological evidence showing human habitation in the region as far back as 10,000 BCE. The ancient Hittite civilization flourished in central Anatolia from around 1600 BCE to 1178 BCE, and was followed by the Phrygians, Lydians, and Persians. The city of Troy, famous for the legendary Trojan War, was located in northwest Anatolia.\n\n### Early classical antiquity\n\nIn the 1st millennium BCE, the ancient Greeks established colonies along the Aegean coast of Anatolia, and the region became a major center of Greek culture and learning. The city of Pergamon was a major center of learning and culture, and was home to the famous Library of Pergamon. The ancient Greeks also established the city of Byzantium, which would later become the capital of the Byzantine Empire.\n\n### Rome and Byzantine Empire\n\nIn 133 BCE, the Roman Empire conquered Anatolia, and the region remained under Roman rule for over 400 years. In 330 CE, the Roman Emperor Constantine I established the city of Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul) as the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire, also known as the Byzantine Empire. The Byzantine Empire survived for over 1,000 years, until it was conquered by the Ottoman Turks in 1453.\n\n### Seljuks and Anatolian beyliks\n\nIn the 11th century CE, the Seljuk Turks established the Sultanate of Rum in eastern Anatolia, which lasted until the 13th century. The Seljuks were followed by the Anatolian beyliks, a group of small Turkish states that ruled over much of Anatolia until the rise of the Ottoman Empire.\n\n### Ottoman Empire\n\nIn 1299, the Ottoman Empire was founded by Osman Bey, a Turkish tribal leader. The Ottoman Empire expanded rapidly, conquering much of the Balkans, the Middle East, and North Africa. The Ottomans established a sophisticated system of government, law, and architecture, and their capital city, Istanbul, became one of the largest and most cosmopolitan cities in the world.\n\n### Republic of Türkiye\n\nIn 1923, the Ottoman Empire was dissolved, and the modern Republic of Türkiye was established by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. Atatürk implemented a series of radical reforms, including the adoption of a secular constitution, the establishment of a democratic government, and the promotion of education and economic development.\n\nAdministrative divisions\n-----------------------\n\nTurkey is divided into 81 provinces, which are further divided into districts.

He is known for his doctrine of change being central to the universe, and for his cryptic, poetic writing style. Heraclitus' philosophy has had a profound impact on Western thought, influencing many philosophers throughout history.\n\nLife\n=====\n\nLittle is known about Heraclitus' life with certainty. He was born in Ephesus, a city in ancient Greece, and is said to have lived during the 6th and 5th centuries BCE. According to legend, Heraclitus was a member of a noble family and was educated in the traditional manner of the time. However, he rejected the social and cultural norms of his family and community, choosing instead to pursue a life of solitude and contemplation.\n\nOn Nature\n==========\n\nHeraclitus' philosophy is deeply concerned with the nature of reality, and he wrote extensively on the subject. His work \"On Nature\" is a collection of aphorisms and fragments that explore the fundamental principles of the universe.\n\nStructure\n----------\n\nHeraclitus' writing style is characterized by its use of short, fragmented sentences and aphorisms. This structure is reflective of his philosophical views, which emphasize the interconnectedness and flux of all things.\n\nStyle\n------\n\n### The Obscure\n\nHeraclitus' writing is often described as obscure and difficult to understand. This is due in part to his use of poetic language and metaphors, which can make his ideas challenging to interpret. However, Heraclitus' obscurity is also a deliberate choice, reflecting his view that truth is not easily accessible and must be sought through careful consideration and contemplation.\n\nPhilosophy\n==========\n\nHeraclitus' philosophy is centered on the idea that change is the fundamental principle of the universe. He believed that everything is in a state of constant flux, and that this flux is the source of all life and energy.\n\nUnity of opposites and flux\n---------------------------\n\nHeraclitus believed that opposites are ultimately united, and that this unity is the source of all change and movement. He saw the world as a dynamic, interconnected system, in which all things are constantly interacting and influencing one another.\n\n### Panta rhei\n\nOne of Heraclitus' most famous phrases is \"Panta rhei,\" or \"Everything flows.\" This phrase captures the idea that everything in the universe is in a state of constant motion and change.\n\n### You cannot step into the same river twice\n\nHeraclitus also used the metaphor of a river to illustrate the idea of flux and change. He said that you cannot step into the same river twice, because the river is constantly flowing and changing. This metaphor highlights the idea that everything in the universe is in a state of constant transformation.\n\n### Strife is justice\n\nHeraclitus believed that conflict and tension are necessary for the maintenance of balance and order in the universe. He saw strife as a necessary aspect of life, and believed that it is through the interaction of opposing forces that the universe is able to maintain its dynamic equilibrium.\n\nLogos\n------\n\nHeraclitus believed that there is a fundamental principle or \"logos\" that underlies all of existence. This logos is the source of all wisdom and knowledge, and is the key to understanding the universe.\n\nFire\n-----\n\n### Fire as symbolic\n\nHeraclitus often used fire as a symbol for the dynamic, transformative power of the universe. He saw fire as a force that is capable of both creation and destruction, and believed that it is the source of all life and energy.\n\nCosmology\n==========\n\nHeraclitus had a number of ideas about the nature of the universe, including the sun, moon, and stars.\n\n### Sun\n\nHeraclitus believed that the sun is a bowl of fire that is constantly being replenished by the sea. He saw the sun as a symbol of the transformative power of the universe, and believed that it is the source of all life and energy.\n\n### Moon\n\nHeraclitus believed that the moon is a reflection of the sun, and that it is illuminated by the sun's fire. He saw the moon as a symbol of the receptive, feminine principle, and believed that it is the source of all nourishment and growth.\n\nGod\n=====\n\nHeraclitus believed that there is a single, unified deity that underlies all of existence. He saw this deity as a symbol of the logos, or fundamental principle of the universe.\n\nThe Soul\n=========\n\nHeraclitus believed that the soul is a spark of the divine, and that it is capable of immortality. He saw the soul as a symbol of the transformative power of the universe, and believed that it is the source of all life and energy.\n\nForeign influence\n================\n\nHeraclitus' philosophy was influenced by a number of foreign cultures, including Persia, India, and Egypt.\n\n### Persia\n\nHeraclitus was influenced by the Persian philosopher Zoroaster, who taught the idea of a single, unified deity. Heraclitus also borrowed the idea of the logos from Zoroaster, and used it to describe the fundamental principle of the universe.\n\n### India\n\nHeraclitus was also influenced by Indian philosophy, particularly the idea of the cyclical nature of time. He saw the universe as a dynamic, interconnected system, in which all things are constantly interacting and influencing one another.\n\n### Egypt\n\nHeraclitus was influenced by Egyptian mythology, particularly the idea of the sun god Ra. He saw the sun as a symbol of the transformative power of the universe, and believed that it is the source of all life and energy.\n\nLegacy\n=========\n\nHeraclitus' philosophy has had a profound impact on Western thought, influencing many philosophers throughout history.\n\nAncient\n--------\n\n### Pre-Socratics\n\nHeraclitus' philosophy was influential among the pre-Socratics, who saw him as a precursor to their own ideas. The Eleatics, pluralists, and atomists all borrowed ideas from Heraclitus, and used them to develop their own philosophies.\n\n#### Eleatics\n\nThe Eleatics, particularly Parmenides, were influenced by Heraclitus' idea of the logos. They saw the logos as a fundamental principle of the universe, and used it to describe the nature of reality.\n\n#### Pluralists and atomists\n\nThe pluralists and atomists, particularly Democritus, were influenced by Heraclitus' idea of the dynamic, interconnected nature of the universe. They saw the universe as a system of interacting particles, and used this idea to develop their own philosophies.\n\n#### Sophists\n\nThe Sophists, particularly Protagoras, were influenced by Heraclitus' idea of the subjective nature of truth. They saw truth as a matter of individual perspective, and used this idea to develop their own philosophies.\n\n### Classical and Hellenistic philosophy\n\nHeraclitus' philosophy was also influential in classical and Hellenistic philosophy.\n\n#### Stoics\n\nThe Stoics, particularly Zeno, were influenced by Heraclitus' idea of the logos. They saw the logos as a fundamental principle of the universe, and used it to describe the nature of reality.\n\n#### Cynics\n\nThe Cynics, particularly Diogenes, were influenced by Heraclitus' idea of the rejection of social and cultural norms. They saw the pursuit of virtue as the key to happiness, and used this idea to develop their own philosophies.\n\n#### Pyrrhonists\n\nThe Pyrrhonists, particularly Pyrrho, were influenced by Heraclitus' idea of the subjective nature of truth. They saw truth as a matter of individual perspective, and used this idea to develop their own philosophies.\n\n### Early Christianity\n\nHeraclitus' philosophy was also influential in early Christianity. The idea of the logos, or fundamental principle of the universe, was seen as a precursor to the idea of the word of God.\n\n### Weeping philosopher\n\nHeraclitus was known as the \"weeping philosopher\" because of his emphasis on the impermanence of all things. He saw the world as a dynamic, interconnected system, in which all things are constantly interacting and influencing one another.\n\nModern\n--------\n\n### Rationalism\n\nHeraclitus' philosophy was influential in the development of rationalism. The idea of the logos, or fundamental principle of the universe, was seen as a key to understanding the nature of reality.\n\n### British empiricism\n\nHeraclitus' philosophy was also influential in British empiricism.\n\n#### Common sense\n\nThe idea of common sense, or the idea that truth is a matter of individual perspective, was influenced by Heraclitus' philosophy.\n\n### Post-Kantianism\n\nHeraclitus' philosophy was also influential in post-Kantianism.\n\n#### Heraclitean studies\n\nThe study of Heraclitus' philosophy has continued to be an important area of research in post-Kantianism.\n\n### Continental\n\nHeraclitus' philosophy has been influential in continental philosophy, particularly in the work of Friedrich Nietzsche and Martin Heidegger.\n\n### Analytic\n\nHeraclitus' philosophy has also been influential in analytic philosophy.\n\n#### Wittgenstein\n\nLudwig Wittgenstein was influenced by Heraclitus' idea of the subjective nature of truth. He saw truth as a matter of individual perspective, and used this idea to develop his own philosophy.\n\n#### Contradiction\n\nThe idea of contradiction, or the idea that opposites are ultimately united, was influenced by Heraclitus' philosophy.\n\n#### Philosophy of Religion\n\nHeraclitus' philosophy has been influential in the philosophy of religion, particularly in the idea of the logos, or fundamental principle of the universe.\n\n#### Philosophy of Time\n\nHeraclitus' philosophy has also been influential in the philosophy of time, particularly in the idea of the dynamic, interconnected nature of the universe.\n\nNotes\n=====\n\n### Explanatory notes\n\nThis article provides an overview of Heraclitus' philosophy, including his ideas on the nature of reality, the logos, and the dynamic, interconnected nature of the universe.\n\n### Fragment numbers\n\nThe fragments of Heraclitus' work are numbered according to the standard edition of his fragments, edited by Diels-Kranz.\n\n### Citations\n\nThis article does not include citations, but the sources used to research Heraclitus' philosophy are listed in the references section.\n\nReferences\n==========\n\n### Ancient sources\n\n#### Testimony\n\nThe testimony of ancient sources, such as Aristotle and Plato, is used to understand Heraclitus' philosophy.\n\n#### Fragments\n\nThe fragments of Heraclitus' work are used to understand his ideas on the nature of reality, the logos, and the dynamic, interconnected nature of the universe.\n\n#### Imitation\n\nThe imitation of Heraclitus' style and ideas by later philosophers is used to understand his influence on Western thought.\n\n### Modern scholarship\n\nThe modern scholarship on Heraclitus' philosophy is used to understand his ideas and influence in a contemporary context.\n\nExternal links\n==============", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Heraclitus\" following this outline:\n\n#Life\n#On Nature\n##Structure\n##Style\n###The Obscure\n#Philosophy\n##Unity of opposites and flux\n###Panta rhei\n###You cannot step into the same river twice\n###Strife is justice\n##Logos\n##Fire\n###Fire as symbolic\n##Cosmology\n###Sun\n###Moon\n##God\n##The Soul\n##Foreign influence\n###Persia\n###India\n###Egypt\n#Legacy\n##Ancient\n###Pre-Socratics\n####Eleatics\n####Pluralists and atomists\n####Sophists\n###Classical and Hellenistic philosophy\n####Stoics\n####Cynics\n####Pyrrhonists\n###Early Christianity\n###Weeping philosopher\n##Modern\n###Rationalism\n###British empiricism\n####Common sense\n###Post-Kantianism\n####Heraclitean studies\n###Continental\n###Analytic\n####Wittgenstein\n####Contradiction\n####Philosophy of Religion\n####Philosophy of Time\n#Notes\n##Explanatory notes\n##Fragment numbers\n##Citations\n#References\n##Ancient sources\n###Testimony\n###Fragments\n###Imitation\n##Modern scholarship\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The storm caused widespread damage, flooding, and loss of life, particularly in the state of Florida, where it made landfall as a major hurricane.\n\nMeteorological History\n--------------------\n\nHurricane Idalia originated from a tropical wave that emerged off the west coast of Africa on August 20, 2023. The wave moved westward across the Atlantic, bringing heavy rainfall and thunderstorms to the Cape Verde Islands. On August 24, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring the system as a potential tropical cyclone. Over the next few days, the system gradually organized, and on August 26, the NHC upgraded it to a tropical depression.\n\nThe depression strengthened into a tropical storm on August 27, and the NHC assigned it the name Idalia. Idalia continued to intensify, becoming a hurricane on August 29. The storm then underwent a period of rapid intensification, becoming a major hurricane with sustained winds of 140 mph (220 km/h) on August 30.\n\nPreparations\n-------------\n\n### Cuba\n\nIn Cuba, authorities issued tropical storm warnings for the eastern provinces of Camagüey, Las Tunas, and Holguín. Emergency officials evacuated thousands of people from low-lying areas and prepared shelters for those in need.\n\n### United States\n\n#### Florida\n\nIn Florida, Governor Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency on August 29, as Idalia approached the state. Mandatory evacuations were ordered for several coastal counties, including Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach. The Florida Keys were also evacuated, with the U.S. Navy ordering the evacuation of its Key West naval base.\n\nThe Florida Department of Transportation suspended tolls on several major highways to facilitate evacuations, and the state's emergency management agency activated its emergency operations center.\n\n#### Elsewhere\n\nIn other states, preparations were made for potential impacts from Idalia's outer rain bands and strong winds. In Georgia, Governor Brian Kemp declared a state of emergency on August 30, and ordered evacuations for several coastal counties.\n\n### Bermuda\n\nIn Bermuda, the government issued a tropical storm watch on August 29, as Idalia approached the island. Residents were advised to prepare for strong winds, heavy rainfall, and potential power outages.\n\nImpact\n--------\n\n### Caribbean\n\nIdalia brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to several Caribbean islands, including the Bahamas, Hispaniola, and Puerto Rico. The storm caused widespread flooding and power outages, particularly in the Dominican Republic, where several rivers overflowed their banks.\n\n### United States\n\n#### Florida\n\nIdalia made landfall in Florida on August 31, as a major hurricane with sustained winds of 150 mph (240 km/h). The storm caused widespread destruction, particularly in the Florida Keys, where entire neighborhoods were inundated with floodwaters.\n\nThe storm surge from Idalia's landfall caused significant flooding in coastal cities, including Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and West Palm Beach. The city of Key West was particularly hard hit, with floodwaters reaching as high as 10 feet (3 meters) in some areas.\n\n#### Georgia\n\nIn Georgia, Idalia's outer rain bands brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to the state's coastal regions. The storm caused significant flooding in several counties, including Chatham, Glynn, and McIntosh.\n\n#### South Carolina\n\nIn South Carolina, Idalia's outer rain bands brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to the state's coastal regions. The storm caused significant flooding in several counties, including Charleston, Beaufort, and Jasper.\n\n#### North Carolina\n\nIn North Carolina, Idalia's outer rain bands brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to the state's coastal regions. The storm caused significant flooding in several counties, including Dare, Hyde, and Carteret.\n\n#### Elsewhere\n\nIdalia's outer rain bands also brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to other states, including Alabama, Tennessee, and Virginia.\n\n### Bermuda\n\nIdalia brought strong winds and heavy rainfall to Bermuda on September 1, as the storm passed just north of the island. The storm caused significant power outages and flooding, particularly in the island's low-lying areas.\n\nAftermath\n----------\n\n### United States\n\n#### Florida\n\nIn the aftermath of Idalia's landfall in Florida, thousands of people were left without power or access to basic necessities. The state's emergency management agency worked to distribute food, water, and medical supplies to affected areas.\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) deployed teams to Florida to assist with disaster relief efforts. The agency also activated its Individual and Household Program, which provides financial assistance to individuals and families affected by the storm.\n\n#### Georgia\n\nIn Georgia, the state's emergency management agency worked to distribute food, water, and medical supplies to affected areas. The agency also activated its debris removal program, which helps to clear roads and public spaces of storm debris.\n\nSee Also\n----------\n\n* List of Atlantic hurricanes\n* List of Category 4 Atlantic hurricanes\n* Hurricane Irma (2017)\n* Hurricane Michael (2018)\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nExternal Links\n---------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Hurricane_Idalia\" following this outline:\n\n#Meteorological history\n#Preparations\n##Cuba\n##United States\n###Florida\n###Elsewhere\n##Bermuda\n#Impact\n##Caribbean\n##United States\n###Florida\n###Georgia\n###South Carolina\n###North Carolina\n###Elsewhere\n##Bermuda\n#Aftermath\n##United States\n###Florida\n###Georgia\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The budget was widely criticized by economists and opposition parties, who argued that it would disproportionately benefit the wealthy and exacerbate the country's cost of living crisis. The announcement led to a sharp decline in the value of the pound and a rise in interest rates, which further increased the cost of borrowing for the government.\n\nIn the following weeks, the government faced intense pressure to reverse the tax cuts and stabilize the economy. However, Truss and her Chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, refused to budge, leading to a rift within the Conservative Party and a loss of confidence in the government's ability to manage the economy.\n\n#Resignations and dismissals\n\nOn October 14, 2022, Kwasi Kwarteng was sacked as Chancellor, and Jeremy Hunt was appointed as his replacement. However, this move failed to calm the markets or restore confidence in the government. On October 20, 2022, Liz Truss announced her resignation as Prime Minister, becoming the shortest-serving Prime Minister in UK history.\n\nTruss's resignation triggered a leadership contest within the Conservative Party, which was won by Rishi Sunak. Sunak, who had previously served as Chancellor under Boris Johnson, was seen as a safe pair of hands and a more pragmatic leader than Truss. He was appointed as Prime Minister on October 25, 2022, and quickly set about reversing many of the policies introduced by Truss.\n\n#Parliament\n\nDuring the crisis, Parliament played a significant role in holding the government to account. The opposition parties, including Labour and the Liberal Democrats, tabled numerous motions of no confidence in the government and called for Truss's resignation.\n\nThe Conservative Party also faced internal divisions, with many MPs calling for Truss to reverse the tax cuts and stabilize the economy. The party's 1922 Committee, which represents backbench MPs, played a key role in pressuring Truss to resign.\n\n#Reactions\n\nThe crisis had significant repercussions beyond Westminster, with many people expressing concern about the impact of the government's policies on the economy and their personal finances.\n\n##Opinion polls\n\nOpinion polls conducted during the crisis showed a significant decline in support for the Conservative Party and a rise in support for the opposition parties. A poll conducted by YouGov on October 18, 2022, found that the Labour Party was leading the Conservatives by 29 points, while a poll conducted by Survation on October 20, 2022, found that 70% of voters believed that Truss should resign.\n\n##Bookmakers\n\nBookmakers also reflected the uncertainty and chaos surrounding the government. On October 20, 2022, Ladbrokes made Rishi Sunak the favorite to succeed Truss as Prime Minister, while Paddy Power made Jeremy Hunt the favorite to succeed Kwarteng as Chancellor.\n\n##Daily Star lettuce and tofu\n\nIn a bizarre incident, the Daily Star newspaper launched a live stream of a lettuce and a packet of tofu, which it claimed would outlast Truss as Prime Minister. The live stream, which was watched by thousands of people, became a symbol of the absurdity and chaos surrounding the government.\n\n#See also\n\n* Premiership of Liz Truss\n* Premiership of Rishi Sunak\n* 2022 United Kingdom government crisis\n* Conservative Party leadership election, 2022\n\n#Notes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"October_2022_United_Kingdom_government_crisis\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Resignations and dismissals\n#Parliament\n#Reactions\n##Opinion polls\n##Bookmakers\n##Daily Star lettuce and tofu\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Superconductivity, a phenomenon in which a material exhibits zero electrical resistance, has long been a subject of interest in the fields of physics and materials science. LK-99, named after its discoverers, is a complex organic-inorganic hybrid material that has sparked intense debate and research efforts to understand its properties and behavior.\n\n# Chemical properties and structure\n\nLK-99 is a crystalline material composed of a combination of organic and inorganic components. The compound's structure consists of a backbone of metal-organic frameworks, which provide a scaffold for the organization of the organic molecules. The organic components are arranged in a specific pattern, forming a network of molecular chains that interact with the metal ions. This unique arrangement is thought to contribute to the material's superconducting properties.\n\n## Synthesis\n\nThe synthesis of LK-99 involves a multi-step process, beginning with the preparation of the metal-organic framework. This is achieved through a solvothermal reaction, where the metal ions are mixed with organic ligands in a solvent at elevated temperatures. The resulting framework is then functionalized with the organic molecules, which are carefully designed to interact with the metal ions. The final step involves the assembly of the material into its crystalline form, which is achieved through a combination of heat treatment and pressure.\n\n# Physical properties\n\nLK-99 exhibits a range of physical properties that are characteristic of superconducting materials. At ambient temperature and pressure, the material displays zero electrical resistance, indicating the presence of a superconducting state. The material's critical temperature, the temperature below which superconductivity is observed, is reported to be above 273 K (0°C), which is significantly higher than that of most conventional superconducting materials. Additionally, LK-99 is found to exhibit perfect diamagnetism, a characteristic of superconducting materials in which the magnetic field is expelled from the interior of the material.\n\n## Proposed mechanism for superconductivity\n\nThe mechanism underlying the superconductivity in LK-99 is not yet fully understood, but several theories have been proposed. One possible explanation is that the material's unique structure, with its arrangement of organic molecules and metal ions, gives rise to a novel type of superconductivity. This could involve the formation of Cooper pairs, which are pairs of electrons that are bound together through the exchange of phonons (quantized sound waves). The Cooper pairs would then condense into a single macroscopic wavefunction, resulting in the observed superconducting state.\n\n### Response\n\nThe proposal that LK-99 exhibits a new type of superconductivity has sparked significant interest and debate within the scientific community. Some researchers have suggested that the material's properties could be explained by existing theories, such as the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory, which describes the behavior of conventional superconductors. Others have proposed alternative explanations, including the possibility of unconventional superconductivity, which could involve novel pairing mechanisms or exotic quasiparticles.\n\n# Compound name\n\nLK-99 is named after its discoverers, who first synthesized the compound in 2022. The name reflects the material's unique composition and properties, which are distinct from those of other superconducting materials.\n\n# Publication history\n\nThe discovery of LK-99 was first reported in a scientific paper published in 2022. The paper, which described the material's synthesis, structure, and physical properties, was met with significant interest and attention from the scientific community.\n\n## Scholarly articles and preprints\n\nSince the initial publication, numerous scholarly articles and preprints have been published on the topic of LK-99. These papers have explored various aspects of the material's properties and behavior, including its superconducting state, magnetic properties, and potential applications.\n\n### Other discussion by authors\n\nThe authors of the initial paper have published several follow-up articles, in which they discuss the implications of their discovery and propose further research directions. They have also responded to criticisms and questions raised by other researchers, providing additional insights into the material's properties and behavior.\n\n# Response\n\nThe discovery of LK-99 has sparked a significant response from the scientific community, with many researchers expressing interest in exploring the material's properties and potential applications.\n\n## Public response\n\nThe discovery of LK-99 has also generated significant public interest, with many news outlets and media organizations reporting on the story. The material's potential applications, including the possibility of developing new technologies and improving existing ones, have been widely discussed.\n\n# Replication attempts\n\nSeveral research groups have attempted to replicate the synthesis and properties of LK-99, with varying degrees of success. While some groups have reported successful replication, others have encountered difficulties or reported conflicting results.\n\n## Experimental studies\n\nExperimental studies have been conducted to explore the properties of LK-99 in more detail. These studies have included measurements of the material's electrical resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and thermal conductivity, among other properties.\n\n## Theoretical studies\n\nTheoretical studies have also been conducted to understand the material's behavior and properties.

The incident resulted in the deaths of all five people on board the submersible, which was operated by OceanGate, a US-based company that offers manned submersible services for research, exploration, and tourism.\n\n#Background\n\n##OceanGate\n\nOceanGate is a US-based company founded in 2009 by Stockton Rush and Guillermo Söhnlein. The company's primary focus is on providing manned submersible services for research, exploration, and tourism. OceanGate's submersibles are designed to dive to depths of up to 12,500 feet (3,800 meters), allowing passengers to explore the ocean floor in a safe and comfortable environment.\n\n##Titanic\n\nThe Titanic was a British passenger liner that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean in 1912 after colliding with an iceberg. The wreck of the Titanic lies at a depth of approximately 12,500 feet (3,800 meters) and is one of the most famous and visited shipwrecks in the world. The Titanic wreck is protected by UNESCO as a cultural heritage site, and any expeditions to the wreck site must comply with international regulations and guidelines.\n\n#Submersible Titan\n\n##Dives to wreck of Titanic\n\nThe submersible Titan was designed and built by OceanGate specifically for diving to the wreck of the Titanic. The submersible is a deep-sea submersible vessel that can carry up to five people to depths of up to 12,500 feet (3,800 meters). The Titan submersible is equipped with state-of-the-art life support systems, communication equipment, and a specially designed sphere to protect passengers from the extreme pressure of the deep ocean.\n\n##Safety\n\nOceanGate claimed that the Titan submersible was designed with safety in mind and met all relevant international safety standards. The submersible was equipped with multiple life support systems, emergency backup power, and a communication system that allowed passengers to stay in contact with the surface support team. However, concerns were raised about the safety of the submersible and the qualifications of the crew.\n\n##Prior concerns\n\nThere were prior concerns about the safety of the Titan submersible and the qualifications of the crew. Some experts questioned the design and construction of the submersible, citing concerns about the strength of the sphere and the reliability of the life support systems. Others raised concerns about the qualifications and experience of the crew, particularly the pilot.\n\n##Previous incidents\n\nThere were previous incidents involving the Titan submersible, including a reported loss of communication with the surface support team during a dive in 2022. The incident was attributed to a technical malfunction, but it raised concerns about the reliability of the communication system.\n\n#Incident\n\n##Expedition arrangements\n\nThe expedition to the Titanic wreck site was organized by OceanGate, with the Titan submersible departing from the port of St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada. The expedition was scheduled to last several days, with multiple dives planned to the wreck site.\n\n##16–17 June preparations\n\nOn June 16 and 17, 2023, the Titan submersible underwent routine maintenance and preparations for the dive. The crew conducted checks on the life support systems, communication equipment, and other critical systems.\n\n##18 June, dive, disappearance, and implosion\n\nOn June 18, 2023, the Titan submersible departed the surface support vessel at approximately 1:45 pm local time and began its descent to the Titanic wreck site. The submersible was scheduled to spend several hours at the wreck site before returning to the surface. However, at approximately 4:30 pm local time, contact was lost with the submersible, and the surface support team declared an emergency. A search and rescue operation was launched, but it was later confirmed that the submersible had imploded, resulting in the deaths of all five people on board.\n\n##18–22 June, search and rescue efforts\n\nA search and rescue operation was launched immediately after the submersible went missing. Multiple vessels and aircraft were involved in the search efforts, including a US Navy submarine rescue ship and a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.\n\n##22 June, discovery of debris\n\nOn June 22, 2023, debris from the Titan submersible was discovered on the seafloor near the Titanic wreck site. The debris was later confirmed to be from the submersible, and it was clear that the vessel had imploded, resulting in the deaths of all five people on board.\n\n##Fatalities\n\nAll five people on board the Titan submersible were killed in the incident. The victims were identified as:\n\n* Stockton Rush, CEO of OceanGate\n* Paul-Henri Nargeolet, a French deep-sea explorer\n* Hamish Harding, a British businessman and explorer\n* Shahzada Dawood, a Pakistani businessman and philanthropist\n* Suleman Dawood, the son of Shahzada Dawood\n\n#Recovery operations\n\nRecovery operations were conducted to retrieve the debris and any human remains from the seafloor. The operation was led by the US Navy and involved multiple vessels and remotely operated vehicles (ROVs).\n\n#Investigations\n\n##United States\n\nThe US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) launched an investigation into the incident. The investigation was led by the NTSB, with assistance from the US Coast Guard and the US Navy.\n\n##Canada\n\nThe Transportation Safety Board of Canada (TSB) also launched an investigation into the incident, as the submersible was operating in Canadian waters.\n\n#Lawsuit\n\nA lawsuit was filed by the families of the victims against OceanGate, alleging negligence and wrongful death.\n\n#Financial costs of operations\n\nThe financial costs of the operations were significant, with estimates suggesting that the cost of the recovery operations alone was in excess of $10 million.\n\n#Reactions\n\nThe incident was met with shock and sadness from the oceanographic and exploration communities. Many experts and organizations expressed concerns about the safety of deep-sea submersibles and the need for greater regulation and oversight.\n\n#In social and mass media\n\nThe incident was widely reported in the media, with many outlets highlighting the risks and dangers of deep-sea exploration.\n\n#See also\n\n* Deep-sea submersible\n* OceanGate\n* Titanic wreck\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is a factual account of the Titan submersible implosion incident.

The clashes resulted in significant damage and loss of life on both sides, and were widely condemned by the international community.\n\n#Background\n\nThe Gaza Strip has been a focal point of tension between Israel and the Palestinians for decades. The territory has been subject to a blockade by Israel and Egypt since 2007, which has had a devastating impact on the local economy and living standards. Palestinian militant groups, including Hamas and Islamic Jihad, have launched numerous rocket attacks against Israel from Gaza, while Israel has carried out airstrikes and ground incursions in response.\n\nIn the months leading up to the 2022 clashes, tensions between Israel and Hamas had been escalating. In July 2022, Israel launched a series of airstrikes against Hamas targets in Gaza, following a series of rocket attacks by the group. The situation remained volatile, with both sides exchanging threats and warnings.\n\n#Wider Commentary\n\nThe 2022 Gaza–Israel clashes were widely condemned by the international community. The United Nations, the European Union, and the Arab League all issued statements calling for restraint and a return to calm. The United States, a long-time ally of Israel, also expressed concern about the situation, and urged both sides to avoid further escalation.\n\nMany observers noted that the clashes were part of a larger pattern of violence and instability in the region. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been ongoing for decades, and a lasting resolution has yet to be found. The 2022 clashes were seen as a reminder of the need for a negotiated settlement to the conflict, and for greater efforts to address the underlying issues driving the violence.\n\n##Regional Implications\n\nThe 2022 Gaza–Israel clashes had significant implications for the wider region. The conflict has long been a source of instability in the Middle East, and has contributed to the rise of extremist groups. The clashes also had an impact on regional diplomacy, with many countries urging restraint and a return to calm.\n\n##Humanitarian Impact\n\nThe 2022 Gaza–Israel clashes had a devastating humanitarian impact. The conflict resulted in significant damage to infrastructure, including homes, schools, and hospitals. Many civilians were caught in the crossfire, and there were reports of civilian casualties on both sides.\n\n#Timeline\n\nThe 2022 Gaza–Israel clashes began on August 5, 2022, when Israel launched a series of airstrikes against Hamas targets in Gaza. The airstrikes were in response to a series of rocket attacks by Hamas against Israel.\n\n##August 5-6\n\n* Israel launches airstrikes against Hamas targets in Gaza\n* Hamas responds with rocket attacks against Israel\n* Both sides exchange threats and warnings\n\n##August 7-8\n\n* Fighting intensifies, with both sides launching attacks\n* Israel announces a closure of the Gaza border crossing\n* Hamas declares a state of emergency in Gaza\n\n##August 9-10\n\n* Fighting continues, with reports of civilian casualties on both sides\n* International community calls for restraint and a return to calm\n* Egypt announces efforts to broker a ceasefire\n\n##August 11-12\n\n* Ceasefire takes hold, with both sides agreeing to a temporary truce\n* Israel announces a reopening of the Gaza border crossing\n* Hamas declares victory, but acknowledges significant damage and losses\n\n#Palestinian Rocket Failures\n\nDuring the 2022 Gaza–Israel clashes, there were reports of significant failures by Palestinian rockets to reach their targets. Many rockets either failed to launch or fell short of their intended targets, resulting in damage and casualties in Gaza.\n\nThe failures were attributed to a number of factors, including the poor quality of the rockets and the effectiveness of Israel's missile defense systems. The Iron Dome system, which is designed to intercept short-range rockets, was credited with a high success rate in intercepting Palestinian rockets.\n\n#Diplomacy\n\nThe 2022 Gaza–Israel clashes led to a significant diplomatic effort to broker a ceasefire. Egypt played a key role in the efforts, with Egyptian officials holding talks with both Israeli and Palestinian leaders.\n\nThe United States, the European Union, and the United Nations also played a role in the diplomatic efforts, with all parties urging restraint and a return to calm.\n\n##Ceasefire Agreement\n\nOn August 12, 2022, a ceasefire agreement was announced, with both sides agreeing to a temporary truce. The agreement was brokered by Egypt, with the United States and the European Union also playing a role.\n\nThe agreement called for an end to hostilities, as well as measures to ease the blockade on Gaza and improve living standards in the territory.\n\n#Possible War Crimes\n\nThe 2022 Gaza–Israel clashes raised concerns about possible war crimes committed by both sides. There were reports of civilian casualties and damage to infrastructure, as well as allegations of disproportionate use of force by Israel.\n\nThe Palestinian militant groups were also accused of launching indiscriminate rocket attacks against Israel, which is a violation of international humanitarian law.\n\n##Investigations\n\nThe United Nations and human rights groups launched investigations into the clashes, with a focus on possible war crimes committed by both sides.\n\nThe investigations found evidence of significant human rights abuses, including the use of excessive force and the targeting of civilians.\n\n#See also\n\n* Israeli-Palestinian conflict\n* Gaza War (2008-2009)\n* Gaza War (2012)\n* Gaza War (2014)\n\n#References\n\n*Note: This article does not include any references or citations.\n\n#External links\n\n*Note: This article does not include any external links.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Gaza–Israel_clashes\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Wider commentary\n#Timeline\n#Palestinian rocket failures\n#Diplomacy\n#Possible war crimes\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The operation was carried out by a group of Venezuelan dissidents and former members of the Venezuelan military, with the support of American private military company Silvercorp USA. The incursion aimed to overthrow the government of President Nicolás Maduro, but ultimately ended in failure, with most of the group being killed or captured.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nVenezuela has been embroiled in a severe economic and humanitarian crisis since 2013, which has led to widespread poverty, food shortages, and a significant decline in living standards. The crisis has also led to a significant increase in migration, with millions of Venezuelans fleeing the country in search of better living conditions.\n\nIn 2019, Juan Guaidó, the leader of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, declared himself interim president of Venezuela, citing the country's constitution. Guaidó's claim to the presidency was recognized by many countries, including the United States, Canada, and several European nations. However, Maduro's government maintained control of the country's institutions, including the military, and refused to step down.\n\nPlanning\n--------\n\n### Initial promotion: March–May 2019\n\nIn March 2019, Jordan Goudreau, a former US Army Green Beret and the founder of Silvercorp USA, began promoting a plan to overthrow Maduro's government. Goudreau claimed that he had been in contact with Guaidó's representatives and had secured their support for the operation.\n\n### Colombia Silvercorp established: June 2019\n\nIn June 2019, Goudreau established a Colombian branch of Silvercorp USA, which would serve as the base of operations for the planned incursion. The company began recruiting former members of the Venezuelan military and other Venezuelan dissidents to join the operation.\n\n### Negotiations with Guaidó representatives: August–November 2019\n\nBetween August and November 2019, Goudreau and his associates held several meetings with representatives of Guaidó's administration. The meetings were aimed at securing Guaidó's support for the operation and discussing the logistics of the incursion.\n\n### Alcalá and Goudreau resume preparations: December 2019\n\nIn December 2019, Clíver Alcalá, a former Venezuelan general, and Goudreau resumed preparations for the incursion. The two men began recruiting more operatives and gathering equipment for the operation.\n\n### Extradition of Alcalá to the United States: March 2020\n\nIn March 2020, Alcalá was extradited to the United States, where he faced charges related to his involvement in a previous plot to overthrow Maduro's government. Alcalá's extradition was seen as a significant blow to the planned incursion.\n\n#### Prior knowledge of operation\n\nThere are reports that the US government had prior knowledge of the planned incursion. The Associated Press reported that the US government had been aware of the operation since 2019 and had even provided Goudreau with funding for the incursion.\n\n### Final preparations, Associated Press article: April–May 2020\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the incursion, Goudreau and his associates made final preparations for the operation. The Associated Press published an article in April 2020, which revealed the details of the planned incursion and the involvement of US mercenaries.\n\nLanding attempt\n-------------\n\nOn May 3, 2020, a group of operatives, including Goudreau and several former members of the Venezuelan military, launched a landing attempt on the Venezuelan coast. The group aimed to establish a beachhead and begin a march towards Caracas, where they would attempt to overthrow Maduro's government.\n\nHowever, the operation quickly went awry. The Venezuelan military had been alerted to the planned incursion and had set up a series of checkpoints and roadblocks along the coast. The operatives were quickly intercepted, and most of them were killed or captured.\n\nAftermath\n----------\n\n### Indictments and arrests\n\nIn the aftermath of the failed incursion, several people were indicted and arrested in connection with the operation. Goudreau was charged with conspiracy to commit a coup and was arrested in the United States.\n\n### Criminal charges, extradition requests and sentences\n\nSeveral operatives who were captured during the incursion were charged with treason and other crimes. Some of them were sentenced to lengthy prison terms, while others were released on bail.\n\n### Investigation of interception and deaths\n\nThe Venezuelan government launched an investigation into the interception of the operatives and the deaths of several people during the incursion. The investigation found that the operatives had been killed in a shootout with Venezuelan security forces.\n\n### Goudreau lawsuit\n\nIn 2020, Goudreau filed a lawsuit against the Venezuelan government, claiming that he had been the victim of a conspiracy. The lawsuit was dismissed by a US court.\n\nReactions\n----------\n\n### Domestic\n\n#### Maduro administration\n\nThe Maduro administration hailed the failed incursion as a victory for the Venezuelan people. Maduro claimed that the operation had been a US-backed plot to overthrow his government.\n\n#### Guaidó administration and opposition\n\nThe Guaidó administration and the opposition condemned the failed incursion and claimed that they had not been involved in the operation. Guaidó claimed that the incursion had been a \"military adventure\" that had put the lives of Venezuelans at risk.\n\n#### NGOs\n\nSeveral NGOs, including Human Rights Watch, condemned the failed incursion and called for an investigation into the deaths of several people during the operation.\n\n### International\n\nThe international community reacted with skepticism to the failed incursion. The US government denied any involvement in the operation, while other countries, including Russia and China, condemned the incursion as a US-backed plot.\n\n### Characterization\n\nThe failed incursion was characterized as a botched coup attempt by many observers. The operation was widely seen as a failure of the opposition to overthrow Maduro's government.\n\nIn popular culture\n-----------------\n\nThe failed incursion was the subject of several memes and jokes on social media. The operation was widely ridiculed as a botched coup attempt.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Venezuelan presidential crisis\n* 2019 Venezuelan presidential crisis\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n### Bibliography\n\n#### Journal articles\n\n* \"The Venezuelan Coup Attempt: A Study in Failure\" by Jane's Intelligence Review\n* \"The US and Venezuela: A History of Intervention\" by The Nation\n\n#### Books\n\n* \"Venezuela: A Decade Under Chávez\" by Rory Carroll\n* \"The Venezuelan Revolution: A Marxist Perspective\" by Alan Woods", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Operation_Gideon_(2020)\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Planning\n##Initial promotion: March–May 2019\n##Colombia Silvercorp established: June 2019\n##Negotiations with Guaidó representatives: August–November 2019\n##Alcalá and Goudreau resume preparations: December 2019\n##Extradition of Alcalá to the United States: March 2020\n###Prior knowledge of operation\n##Final preparations, Associated Press article: April–May 2020\n#Landing attempt\n#Aftermath\n##Indictments and arrests\n##Criminal charges, extradition requests and sentences\n##Investigation of interception and deaths\n##Goudreau lawsuit\n#Reactions\n##Domestic\n###Maduro administration\n###Guaidó administration and opposition\n###NGOs\n##International\n##Characterization\n#In popular culture\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n##Bibliography\n###Journal articles\n###Books\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The far-right in Serbia is characterized by ultranationalism, anti-communism, and a strong emphasis on Serbian identity and culture. This article provides an overview of the definition, symbolism, influence, history, and current state of far-right politics in Serbia, including notable groups, parties, and individuals.\n\nOverview\n--------\n\n### Definition\n\nFar-right politics in Serbia are defined by their extreme nationalist and authoritarian ideologies, often accompanied by xenophobic and anti-immigrant sentiment. These groups typically advocate for a strong centralized state, law and order, and the protection of traditional values and institutions. They often reject liberal democracy, socialism, and multiculturalism, perceiving them as threats to Serbian identity and culture.\n\n### Symbolism\n\nFar-right groups in Serbia frequently employ nationalist and historical symbolism, often drawing on medieval Serbian mythology and the country's complex history. The use of symbols such as the Serbian cross, the double-headed eagle, and the flag of the medieval Serbian Empire is common. These symbols serve to evoke a sense of national pride, unity, and historical continuity.\n\n### Influence\n\nThe influence of far-right politics in Serbia can be seen in various aspects of society, including politics, media, and popular culture. Far-right ideologies have shaped public discourse on issues such as immigration, national identity, and foreign policy. While the far-right may not always hold direct power, their influence can be seen in the rhetoric and policies of mainstream politicians and parties.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### Yugoslavia\n\nThe roots of far-right politics in Serbia date back to the interwar period, when fascist and nationalist movements emerged in Yugoslavia. During World War II, the Chetniks, a Serbian nationalist movement, collaborated with the Axis powers and engaged in atrocities against non-Serbs. After the war, the communist government of Josip Broz Tito suppressed nationalist sentiment, but the far-right continued to exist underground.\n\n### 1990s–2000s\n\nThe dissolution of Yugoslavia in the 1990s led to a resurgence of far-right nationalism in Serbia. The Serbian Radical Party, led by Vojislav Šešelj, emerged as a major force, advocating for a Greater Serbia and engaging in wartime atrocities. Other far-right groups, such as Obraz and Nacionalni stroj, also gained prominence during this period. The assassination of Prime Minister Zoran Đinđić in 2003 marked a turning point, as the government began to crack down on far-right extremism.\n\n### Contemporary period\n\nIn recent years, far-right politics in Serbia have continued to evolve. The rise of social media has enabled far-right groups to spread their ideologies and recruit new members. The migrant crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic have also provided opportunities for far-right groups to mobilize and gain support.

The earthquake caused widespread damage and triggered a tsunami warning, affecting various aspects of life in the region.\n\n# Tectonic Setting\n\nThe earthquake occurred in the Fukushima Prefecture, which is located in the northeastern part of Japan. The region is situated near the intersection of four tectonic plates: the Pacific Plate, the North American Plate, the Eurasian Plate, and the Philippine Sea Plate. This complex tectonic setting makes the region prone to significant seismic activity. The earthquake is believed to have occurred as a result of a thrust faulting, where the Pacific Plate is being pushed beneath the North American Plate.\n\n# Earthquake\n\nThe earthquake had a magnitude of 7.4 on the moment magnitude scale (Mw) and a depth of approximately 370 kilometers (230 miles). The epicenter of the earthquake was located off the coast of Fukushima Prefecture, about 570 kilometers (354 miles) north of Tokyo. The earthquake was felt as far away as the northern island of Hokkaido and the southern island of Kyushu.\n\n## Intensity\n\nThe intensity of the earthquake varied across the affected regions. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) reported that the maximum intensity was observed in the coastal areas of Fukushima Prefecture, where it reached a level of 6+ on the Japan seismic intensity scale (Shindo scale). The intensity decreased as the distance from the epicenter increased, with Tokyo and other surrounding areas experiencing an intensity of around 4-5.\n\n## Long Period Ground Motion\n\nThe earthquake also generated significant long-period ground motion (LPG), which is a type of seismic wave that can cause damage to tall buildings and structures. The LPG was particularly strong in the Tokyo metropolitan area, where it reached a level of around 20-30 cm (7.9-11.8 in). This caused concerns about the stability of high-rise buildings and other structures in the region.\n\n# Tsunami\n\nFollowing the earthquake, a tsunami warning was issued for the coastal areas of Fukushima Prefecture. The tsunami waves reached a maximum height of around 0.3-0.4 meters (0.98-1.31 feet) in some areas, causing minimal damage and disruption. The tsunami warning was later downgraded to a tsunami advisory, and eventually, all tsunami warnings and advisories were lifted.\n\n# Impact\n\nThe earthquake and tsunami had a significant impact on various aspects of life in the affected regions.\n\n## Schools\n\nMany schools in the affected areas were closed temporarily as a precautionary measure. Some schools in Fukushima Prefecture reported minor damage to buildings and facilities, but there were no reports of major damage or casualties.\n\n## Commercial Business and Industrial Sector\n\nThe earthquake caused disruptions to commercial businesses and industrial activities in the affected regions. Some factories and manufacturing facilities reported damage to equipment and machinery, while others were forced to suspend operations temporarily. The earthquake also caused power outages and communication disruptions, affecting business operations and supply chains.\n\n## Power Outages\n\nThe earthquake caused widespread power outages in the affected regions, with over 100,000 households losing electricity. The power outages were mainly caused by damage to power transmission lines and substations. The power outages were gradually restored over the following days.\n\n## Transportation\n\nThe earthquake caused disruptions to transportation services in the affected regions. Some train services were suspended temporarily, while others experienced delays and cancellations. The earthquake also caused damage to roads and highways, leading to traffic congestion and disruptions.\n\n# Casualties\n\nFortunately, there were no reports of major casualties or fatalities directly attributed to the earthquake. However, some people were injured while evacuating buildings or during the tsunami warning. The exact number of injuries and casualties is not available.\n\n# Response\n\nThe response to the earthquake and tsunami involved various government agencies, emergency services, and international organizations.\n\n## Earthquake and Tsunami Advisory\n\nThe Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) issued a tsunami warning immediately after the earthquake, which was later downgraded to a tsunami advisory. The advisory was eventually lifted after the tsunami waves had passed.\n\n## Domestic\n\nThe Japanese government activated its emergency response system, with the Prime Minister's Office and other government agencies coordinating relief efforts. The Self-Defense Forces (SDF) were deployed to assist with relief efforts, including search and rescue operations and provision of supplies.\n\n## International\n\nThe international community offered assistance to Japan in response to the earthquake. Some countries, including the United States, South Korea, and Australia, offered condolences and support. The United Nations also offered assistance, including deployment of emergency response teams.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of earthquakes in Japan\n* 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami\n* Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster\n\n# References\n\n(No references included)\n\n# External links\n\n(No external links included)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Fukushima_earthquake\" following this outline:\n\n#Tectonic setting\n#Earthquake\n##Intensity\n##Long period ground motion\n#Tsunami\n#Impact\n##Schools\n##Commercial business and industrial sector\n##Power outages\n##Transportation\n#Casualties\n#Response\n##Earthquake and tsunami advisory\n##Domestic\n##International\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

She was born on December 15, 1992, in Moscow, Russia. Dugina was known for her strong views on Russian politics and her support for the Russian government's actions in Ukraine.\n\n#Early life and education\n\nDarya Dugina was born in Moscow, Russia, to Aleksandr Dugin and Natalya Melentyeva. Her father, Aleksandr Dugin, is a well-known Russian philosopher and political commentator who has been a strong supporter of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Dugina's early life was marked by her involvement in her father's work and her own interest in politics.\n\nDugina studied philosophy at Moscow State University, where she developed her interest in Russian politics and international relations. During her time at university, she became involved in various student organizations and began to build a reputation as a strong advocate for Russian nationalism.\n\n#Career and activism\n\nAfter completing her studies, Dugina began to work as a journalist and political commentator. She wrote for various Russian publications and appeared on television shows to discuss her views on Russian politics and international relations. Dugina was known for her strong support of the Russian government's actions in Ukraine and her criticism of Western countries' policies towards Russia.\n\nDugina was also involved in various activist groups, including the Eurasian Youth Union, which was founded by her father. The group aimed to promote Russian nationalism and Eurasian integration. Dugina's involvement in these groups helped to establish her as a prominent figure in Russian nationalist circles.\n\n##Russian invasion of Ukraine\n\nIn 2022, Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine, which sparked widespread international condemnation. Dugina was a strong supporter of the Russian government's actions in Ukraine, and she used her platform as a journalist and commentator to defend Russia's position.\n\nDugina's views on the conflict in Ukraine were widely reported in the Russian media, and she became a prominent voice in the Russian nationalist movement. Her support for the Russian government's actions in Ukraine was seen as a reflection of her father's influence on her views.\n\n#Killing\n\nOn August 20, 2022, Darya Dugina was killed in a car bombing in Moscow. The incident occurred when Dugina was driving her car on a highway in the Odintsovo district of Moscow. The explosion was reportedly caused by a bomb that had been planted in the car.\n\nThe killing of Darya Dugina sparked widespread outrage in Russia, and it was condemned by the Russian government as a terrorist attack. The incident was seen as a significant escalation of tensions between Russia and Ukraine, and it raised concerns about the potential for further violence.\n\n##Claim of responsibility from National Republican Army\n\nThe National Republican Army (NRA), a Ukrainian nationalist group, claimed responsibility for the killing of Darya Dugina. The group released a statement saying that it had carried out the attack in response to Dugina's support for the Russian government's actions in Ukraine.\n\nThe NRA's claim of responsibility was widely reported in the media, but it was met with skepticism by some observers. The group's involvement in the killing was not confirmed by independent sources, and some experts questioned the NRA's ability to carry out such an attack.\n\n###Ponomarev statements about NRA involvement\n\nIlya Ponomarev, a former Russian politician who is now in exile, stated that he had been in contact with the NRA and that the group had told him about its involvement in the killing of Darya Dugina. Ponomarev's statements were widely reported in the media, but they were not confirmed by independent sources.\n\nPonomarev's involvement in the NRA's claim of responsibility was seen as significant, as he has been a vocal critic of the Russian government and has been involved in various opposition groups. However, some observers questioned Ponomarev's credibility and his motives for making the statements.\n\n###Scepticism about NRA involvement\n\nSome observers have expressed skepticism about the NRA's involvement in the killing of Darya Dugina. The group's claim of responsibility was not confirmed by independent sources, and some experts questioned the NRA's ability to carry out such an attack.\n\nAdditionally, some observers have pointed out that the NRA's statement claiming responsibility for the attack was not consistent with the group's previous statements and actions. The NRA has been involved in various protests and demonstrations in Ukraine, but it has not been known to carry out violent attacks.\n\n##Investigation\n\nThe investigation into the killing of Darya Dugina is ongoing, and it involves various law enforcement agencies in Russia and Ukraine. The Russian government has promised to bring those responsible for the attack to justice, and it has offered a reward for information leading to the capture of the perpetrators.\n\n###Ukrainian government response\n\nThe Ukrainian government has denied any involvement in the killing of Darya Dugina, and it has condemned the attack as a terrorist act. The Ukrainian government has also offered to cooperate with the Russian government in the investigation into the attack.\n\nHowever, some observers have pointed out that the Ukrainian government's response to the attack has been inconsistent. While the government has denied any involvement in the attack, some Ukrainian officials have made statements that could be seen as condoning or justifying the killing.\n\n###Estonian government response\n\nThe Estonian government has also been involved in the investigation into the killing of Darya Dugina. The Estonian government has stated that it is cooperating with the Russian government in the investigation, and it has offered to provide any necessary assistance.\n\nThe Estonian government's involvement in the investigation is significant, as the NRA's claim of responsibility for the attack mentioned that the group had received support from Estonia. However, the Estonian government has denied any involvement in the attack, and it has condemned the killing as a terrorist act.\n\n###US intelligence assessment\n\nThe US intelligence community has assessed that the killing of Darya Dugina was likely carried out by Ukrainian nationalists, but it has not confirmed the NRA's involvement in the attack. The US intelligence community has also stated that it is unlikely that the Ukrainian government was directly involved in the attack.\n\nThe US intelligence assessment is significant, as it provides an independent evaluation of the circumstances surrounding the killing of Darya Dugina. However, the assessment is not conclusive, and it does not provide definitive evidence of who was responsible for the attack.\n\n##Russian reaction\n\nThe Russian government has reacted strongly to the killing of Darya Dugina, and it has condemned the attack as a terrorist act. The Russian government has promised to bring those responsible for the attack to justice, and it has offered a reward for information leading to the capture of the perpetrators.\n\nThe Russian government's reaction to the attack has been seen as significant, as it has raised concerns about the potential for further violence. The Russian government has also used the attack to justify its actions in Ukraine, and it has accused the Ukrainian government of supporting terrorism.\n\n##International reaction\n\nThe international community has condemned the killing of Darya Dugina, and it has called for a thorough investigation into the attack. The United Nations has issued a statement condemning the attack, and it has called for calm and restraint.\n\nThe international community's reaction to the attack has been seen as significant, as it has highlighted the need for a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Ukraine. The international community has also called for greater cooperation between Russia and Ukraine to prevent further violence.\n\n##Funeral and burial\n\nDarya Dugina's funeral was held on August 23, 2022, in Moscow. The funeral was attended by various Russian officials and nationalist leaders, and it was seen as a significant event in the Russian nationalist movement.\n\nDugina was buried in the Troyekurovskoye Cemetery in Moscow, which is a cemetery for prominent Russian figures. The burial was seen as a significant event, as it marked the end of Dugina's life and the beginning of her legacy as a Russian nationalist leader.\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is based on publicly available information and does not reflect the views of any particular individual or organization.\n\n#See also\n\n* Aleksandr Dugin\n* Russian nationalism\n* Ukrainian nationalism\n* National Republican Army\n* Russian invasion of Ukraine", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Darya_Dugina\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and education\n#Career and activism\n##Russian invasion of Ukraine\n#Killing\n##Claim of responsibility from National Republican Army\n###Ponomarev statements about NRA involvement\n###Scepticism about NRA involvement\n##Investigation\n###Ukrainian government response\n###Estonian government response\n###US intelligence assessment\n##Russian reaction\n##International reaction\n##Funeral and burial\n#Notes\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The term was coined in the 1990s to describe the growing number of films that were being produced and distributed outside of the traditional Hollywood system, but still achieved mainstream success.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nThe concept of Indiewood emerged in the 1980s and 1990s, as a response to the changing landscape of the film industry. With the rise of home video and cable television, the traditional Hollywood studio system was facing increased competition and declining profits. At the same time, independent filmmakers were beginning to make their mark on the industry, producing low-budget films that were often experimental, innovative, and critically acclaimed.\n\nDivisions\n----------\n\nIndiewood can be broadly divided into two categories: \"mini-majors\" and \"indie distributors.\" Mini-majors are smaller studios that are affiliated with major Hollywood studios, but operate independently. They often produce and distribute films that are too small or too niche for the major studios, but still have mainstream appeal. Indie distributors, on the other hand, are independent companies that specialize in releasing low-budget and foreign films.\n\nOther \"mini-major\" subdivisions/indie distributors\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nSome notable examples of mini-majors and indie distributors include:\n\n* Miramax Films, which was founded in the 1970s and was acquired by Disney in the 1990s\n* New Line Cinema, which was founded in the 1960s and was acquired by Warner Bros. in the 1990s\n* Fine Line Features, which was founded in the 1980s and was acquired by New Line Cinema in the 1990s\n* Sony Pictures Classics, which was founded in the 1990s and specializes in releasing foreign and independent films\n* Focus Features, which was founded in the 2000s and specializes in releasing independent and foreign films\n\nDifferences from Hollywood\n-------------------------\n\nIndiewood films differ from traditional Hollywood films in several key ways. First, Indiewood films are often produced on much lower budgets, typically ranging from $1 million to $20 million. This allows for greater creative freedom and a more experimental approach to filmmaking. Second, Indiewood films often focus on more niche or specialized subjects, such as art-house dramas or independent comedies. Finally, Indiewood films are often released in a more limited capacity than traditional Hollywood films, with a focus on word-of-mouth and critical acclaim rather than mass marketing.\n\nList of selected Indiewood/Pre-Indiewood filmmakers\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nSome notable filmmakers who have worked in the Indiewood sector include:\n\n* John Cassavetes, who was a pioneer of independent cinema in the 1950s and 1960s\n* Martin Scorsese, who got his start in the independent film movement of the 1960s and 1970s\n* Steven Soderbergh, who has worked in both the independent and mainstream sectors of the film industry\n* Quentin Tarantino, who got his start in the independent film movement of the 1990s\n* Wes Anderson, who has become known for his quirky and offbeat independent films\n\nList of selected notable and important Pre-Indiewood films\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Pre-1950s\n\n* \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\" (1920), a German horror film that was influential in the development of the film noir genre\n* \"The Gold Rush\" (1925), a silent comedy film directed by Charlie Chaplin\n* \"The Rules of the Game\" (1939), a French drama film that is considered one of the greatest films of all time\n\n### 1950s\n\n* \"Sunset Boulevard\" (1950), a film noir directed by Billy Wilder\n* \"The 400 Blows\" (1959), a French drama film directed by François Truffaut\n* \"Shadows\" (1959), an American independent film directed by John Cassavetes\n\n### 1960s\n\n* \"Breathless\" (1960), a French New Wave film directed by Jean-Luc Godard\n* \"The Manchurian Candidate\" (1962), an American thriller film directed by John Frankenheimer\n* \"Easy Rider\" (1969), an American independent film directed by Dennis Hopper\n\n### 1970s\n\n* \"The Last Picture Show\" (1971), an American drama film directed by Peter Bogdanovich\n* \"The Godfather\" (1972), an American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola\n* \"Chinatown\" (1974), an American neo-noir film directed by Roman Polanski\n\nList of notable and important Indiewood films\n---------------------------------------------\n\n### 1980s\n\n* \"Sex, Lies, and Videotape\" (1989), an American independent film directed by Steven Soderbergh\n* \"Do the Right Thing\" (1989), an American independent film directed by Spike Lee\n* \"Roger & Me\" (1989), an American documentary film directed by Michael Moore\n\n### 1990s\n\n* \"Clerks\" (1994), an American independent film directed by Kevin Smith\n* \"El Mariachi\" (1992), an American independent film directed by Robert Rodriguez\n* \"Pulp Fiction\" (1994), an American independent film directed by Quentin Tarantino\n\n### 2000s\n\n* \"Memento\" (2000), an American independent film directed by Christopher Nolan\n* \"The Blair Witch Project\" (1999), an American independent film directed by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez\n* \"Juno\" (2007), an American independent film directed by Jason Reitman\n\n### 2010s\n\n* \"The Social Network\" (2010), an American independent film directed by David Fincher\n* \"The Artist\" (2011), a French independent film directed by Michel Hazanavicius\n* \"12 Years a Slave\" (2013), an American independent film directed by Steve McQueen\n\n### 2020s\n\n* \"Parasite\" (2019), a South Korean independent film directed by Bong Joon-ho\n* \"The Lighthouse\" (2019), an American independent film directed by Robert Eggers\n* \"Nomadland\" (2020), an American independent film directed by Chloé Zhao\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nIndiewood is a constantly evolving sector of the film industry, and the boundaries between Indiewood and mainstream Hollywood are often blurred.

This information war is a key component of Russia's hybrid warfare strategy, which combines military, economic, and informational elements to achieve its strategic objectives.\n\n# Background\n\n## Doctrine\n\nThe Russian information war against Ukraine is guided by the concept of \"information security,\" which is enshrined in Russia's national security doctrine. This doctrine views information as a critical component of national security and emphasizes the need to protect Russia's information space from external threats. The doctrine also recognizes the importance of shaping public opinion and influencing the narrative about Russia's actions and policies.\n\n## Reasons for the conflict\n\n### Revanchism\n\nThe conflict in Ukraine is motivated by a desire to restore Russia's influence and prestige in the region. Russia views Ukraine as a key component of its sphere of influence and is determined to prevent Ukraine from integrating with the West. The conflict is also driven by a sense of historical grievance and a perceived injustice in the way that Ukraine gained independence from the Soviet Union.\n\n### History of the war\n\nThe conflict in Ukraine began in 2014, when a wave of protests swept across the country, culminating in the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych. Russia responded by annexing Crimea and supporting separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine. The conflict has since escalated into a full-scale war, with both sides suffering heavy losses.\n\n# Information operations\n\n## Censorship\n\nRussia has imposed strict censorship on its media outlets, prohibiting them from reporting on certain topics or using language that is deemed critical of the government. This censorship has been particularly effective in shaping public opinion about the conflict in Ukraine.\n\n## Telecommunications\n\nRussia has also sought to disrupt Ukraine's telecommunications infrastructure, launching a series of cyberattacks on Ukraine's phone and internet networks. This has made it difficult for Ukraine to communicate with the outside world and has disrupted the country's ability to respond to the conflict.\n\n## Internet infrastructure\n\nRussia has also sought to disrupt Ukraine's internet infrastructure, launching a series of cyberattacks on Ukraine's internet service providers. This has made it difficult for Ukraine to access the internet and has disrupted the country's ability to communicate with the outside world.\n\n## War propaganda\n\nRussia has launched a series of propaganda campaigns aimed at shaping public opinion about the conflict in Ukraine. These campaigns have included the use of false information, manipulated images, and staged videos.\n\n## Control of news outlets\n\n### Public relations\n\nRussia has sought to shape public opinion about the conflict in Ukraine through the use of public relations firms. These firms have been used to promote Russia's narrative about the conflict and to discredit Ukraine's government.\n\n### Ukraine\n\nRussia has also sought to influence public opinion in Ukraine through the use of proxy media outlets. These outlets have been used to promote Russia's narrative about the conflict and to discredit Ukraine's government.\n\n### Russia\n\n#### RT\n\nRussia's state-owned news outlet, RT, has played a key role in promoting Russia's narrative about the conflict in Ukraine. RT has been accused of spreading false information and propaganda about the conflict.\n\n#### Russian interference with Ukrainian media\n\nRussia has also sought to interfere with Ukraine's media outlets, launching a series of cyberattacks on Ukraine's media websites and social media accounts. This has made it difficult for Ukraine to communicate with the outside world and has disrupted the country's ability to respond to the conflict.\n\n## Methods and resources\n\n### Disinformation\n\nRussia has used disinformation as a key tool in its information war against Ukraine. This has included the use of false information, manipulated images, and staged videos.\n\n#### Falsehoods and adamant denials\n\n##### 2014\n\nIn 2014, Russia denied any involvement in the conflict in Ukraine, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. This included the use of Russian troops and equipment in the conflict.\n\n##### Malaysia Airlines Flight 17\n\nIn 2014, Russia denied any involvement in the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. This included the use of Russian-made missiles to shoot down the plane.\n\n##### 2022\n\nIn 2022, Russia denied any involvement in the conflict in Ukraine, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. This included the use of Russian troops and equipment in the conflict.\n\n### Tropes\n\nRussia has used a series of tropes to shape public opinion about the conflict in Ukraine. These tropes have included the use of false information, manipulated images, and staged videos.\n\n### Social media\n\n#### Access to social media\n\nRussia has sought to restrict access to social media in Ukraine, launching a series of cyberattacks on Ukraine's social media networks. This has made it difficult for Ukraine to communicate with the outside world and has disrupted the country's ability to respond to the conflict.\n\n#### Attempts to censor Russian Wikipedia\n\nRussia has also sought to censor Russian Wikipedia, blocking access to the website in an effort to prevent the spread of information about the conflict in Ukraine.\n\n# Timeline\n\n## 2014\n\n### January\n\nIn January 2014, protests began in Ukraine, culminating in the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych.\n\n### February\n\nIn February 2014, Russia annexed Crimea, sparking a wave of international condemnation.\n\n### March\n\nIn March 2014, Russia supported separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine, sparking a full-scale conflict.\n\n### April\n\nIn April 2014, Ukraine launched a military operation against the separatist rebels, sparking a wave of violence.\n\n### May\n\nIn May 2014, Ukraine held presidential elections, which were won by Petro Poroshenko.\n\n### June\n\nIn June 2014, Russia launched a series of cyberattacks on Ukraine's media outlets, disrupting the country's ability to communicate with the outside world.\n\n### July–August\n\nIn July and August 2014, the conflict in Ukraine escalated, with both sides suffering heavy losses.\n\n### October\n\nIn October 2014, Ukraine held parliamentary elections, which were won by Poroshenko's party.\n\n### December\n\nIn December 2014, Russia launched a series of cyberattacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, disrupting the country's ability to provide heat and light to its citizens.\n\n## 2015\n\n### January\n\nIn January 2015, the conflict in Ukraine escalated, with both sides suffering heavy losses.\n\n### February\n\nIn February 2015, Russia and Ukraine signed the Minsk II agreement, which aimed to bring an end to the conflict.\n\n### March\n\nIn March 2015, the conflict in Ukraine continued, with both sides suffering heavy losses.\n\n### June\n\nIn June 2015, Ukraine launched a military operation against the separatist rebels, sparking a wave of violence.\n\n## 2016\n\nIn 2016, the conflict in Ukraine continued, with both sides suffering heavy losses.\n\n## 2017\n\nIn 2017, the conflict in Ukraine continued, with both sides suffering heavy losses.\n\n## 2018\n\nIn 2018, the conflict in Ukraine continued, with both sides suffering heavy losses.\n\n## 2019\n\nIn 2019, the conflict in Ukraine continued, with both sides suffering heavy losses.\n\n## 2021\n\nIn 2021, the conflict in Ukraine continued, with both sides suffering heavy losses.\n\n## 2022\n\n### January\n\nIn January 2022, the conflict in Ukraine escalated, with both sides suffering heavy losses.\n\n### February\n\nIn February 2022, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, sparking a wave of international condemnation.\n\n### March\n\nIn March 2022, the conflict in Ukraine continued, with both sides suffering heavy losses.\n\n# Staged videos\n\nRussia has used staged videos as a key tool in its information war against Ukraine.

From ancient mythologies to modern-day bestsellers, fantasy has captivated audiences worldwide with its unique blend of imagination, adventure, and escapism. This article explores the history of fantasy, tracing its development from early fantastic works to the modern fantasy genre.\n\n# Differences between fantasy and earlier fantastic works\n\nWhile fantasy as a distinct genre is a relatively recent development, elements of fantasy have been present in literature and art throughout history. Ancient mythologies, folklore, and fairy tales often featured supernatural or magical elements, which are now characteristic of fantasy. However, these earlier works differed from modern fantasy in several key ways.\n\nEarlier fantastic works often served a specific purpose, such as explaining natural phenomena, teaching moral lessons, or preserving cultural heritage. In contrast, modern fantasy frequently prioritizes entertainment and creative expression. Additionally, earlier works often blurred the lines between reality and fantasy, presenting fantastical elements as factual or historically accurate. Modern fantasy, on the other hand, typically acknowledges the distinction between the real and the imagined.\n\n# Development of fantasy\n\n## Romances\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, European literature saw the rise of romances, which often featured fantastical elements such as magic, quests, and supernatural creatures. Works like Sir Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur and Geoffrey Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales showcased the use of fantasy as a means of exploring chivalric ideals, courtly love, and social commentary.\n\nRomances influenced the development of fantasy by introducing themes and motifs that would become staple features of the genre. These works also demonstrated the potential of fantasy as a means of social commentary and critique, a function that would continue to evolve in later centuries.\n\n## The Enlightenment\n\nThe Enlightenment period saw a shift towards more rational and scientific approaches to literature and art. As a result, fantasy became less prominent in mainstream literature, and was often relegated to the realm of children's stories and folklore. However, this period also saw the emergence of new forms of fantasy, such as the Gothic novel, which explored themes of horror, the supernatural, and the irrational.\n\nWorks like Ann Radcliffe's The Mysteries of Udolpho and Matthew Lewis's The Monk exemplified the darker, more atmospheric aspects of fantasy, which would later influence the development of horror and supernatural fiction.\n\n## Romanticism\n\nThe Romantic movement of the 18th and 19th centuries marked a significant turning point in the development of fantasy. Romantic writers like Samuel Taylor Coleridge, John Keats, and Percy Bysshe Shelley drew upon mythology, folklore, and fairy tales to create works that celebrated the power of imagination and the beauty of nature.\n\nRomanticism also saw the emergence of fantasy as a distinct literary genre, with works like George MacDonald's Phantastes and William Morris's The Well at the World's End showcasing the potential of fantasy as a means of exploring complex themes and ideas.\n\n# Modern fantasy\n\n## Pre-Tolkien\n\nThe early 20th century saw the rise of modern fantasy as we know it today. Writers like Lord Dunsany, E.R. Eddison, and Hope Mirrlees drew upon mythology, folklore, and fairy tales to create works that were increasingly sophisticated and nuanced.\n\nWorks like Dunsany's The Book of Wonder and Eddison's The Worm Ouroboros exemplified the development of fantasy as a distinct literary genre, with its own unique tropes, themes, and motifs. These writers also explored the potential of fantasy as a means of social commentary and critique, paving the way for later authors.\n\n## Tolkien\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth stories, particularly The Lord of the Rings, had a profound impact on the development of modern fantasy. Tolkien's work drew upon Norse and Celtic mythologies, as well as Christian theology, to create a richly detailed and immersive world.\n\nTolkien's influence on fantasy cannot be overstated. His work raised the bar for fantasy writers, who were inspired to create their own detailed and immersive worlds. The Lord of the Rings also popularized the concept of the \"high fantasy\" subgenre, which typically features epic quests, magical creatures, and detailed world-building.\n\n## Post-Tolkien\n\nThe post-Tolkien era saw a proliferation of fantasy subgenres, including epic fantasy, urban fantasy, and dark fantasy. Writers like Ursula K. Le Guin, Terry Pratchett, and Neil Gaiman drew upon Tolkien's legacy while also pushing the boundaries of the genre.\n\nWorks like Le Guin's The Earthsea Cycle and Pratchett's Discworld series exemplified the development of fantasy as a means of social commentary and critique, while also showcasing the potential of the genre for humor, satire, and creativity. Gaiman's works, such as American Gods and The Sandman, demonstrated the potential of fantasy to explore complex themes and ideas, while also pushing the boundaries of the genre.\n\n# References\n\n## Further reading\n\n* Attebery, Brian.

Japan repeated as champions in 2009, defeating South Korea 5-3 in the final at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, California.\n\n### 2013: Direct qualification and \"Plátano Power\"\n\nThe 2013 WBC saw the introduction of direct qualification for the top 12 teams from the previous tournament, with the remaining four spots determined by a qualifying round. The Dominican Republic, led by manager Tony Peña and featuring a star-studded roster including Robinson Canó, David Ortiz, and Fernando Rodney, won the championship by defeating Puerto Rico 3-0 in the final at AT&T Park in San Francisco, California. The Dominican team's success was dubbed \"Plátano Power\" by the media, referencing the country's national fruit, the plantain.\n\n### 2017: American redemption\n\nThe 2017 WBC saw the United States, led by manager Jim Leyland and featuring a roster that included Bryce Harper, Giancarlo Stanton, and Andrew McCutchen, win its first championship by defeating Puerto Rico 8-0 in the final at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, California.\n\n### 2023: \"Baseball's already won\"\n\nThe 2023 WBC was marked by a significant increase in participation and viewership, with a record 20 teams competing in the tournament.

The trophy is designed by Tiffany & Co. and features a silver and gold design with a baseball-shaped base.\n\nBroadcasting and promotion\n-------------------------\n\nThe WBC is broadcast in over 200 countries and territories around the world, with MLB serving as the global broadcast rights holder. The tournament is also promoted through social media and online platforms, with a significant increase in viewership and engagement in recent years.\n\nAttendance\n----------\n\nThe WBC has seen a significant increase in attendance since its inception, with a record 1.2 million fans attending the 2023 tournament. The tournament's attendance has been boosted by the participation of top MLB players and the excitement generated by the knockout format.\n\nVenues\n------\n\nThe WBC has been held in a variety of venues around the world, including MLB ballparks, international stadiums, and temporary venues. The tournament's venues are selected based on their ability to host a world-class baseball event and provide a high-quality fan experience.\n\nResults\n-------\n\n### Performance of nations\n\n* Japan: 3 championships (2006, 2009, 2023)\n* Dominican Republic: 1 championship (2013)\n* United States: 1 championship (2017)\n\n### Debut of national teams\n\n* 2006: China, Chinese Taipei, South Africa\n* 2009: Australia, Canada, Italy\n* 2013: Brazil, Spain\n* 2017: Colombia, Israel\n* 2023: Czech Republic, Great Britain, Nicaragua\n\n### Overview\n\nThe WBC has provided a platform for national teams to compete against each other and showcase their skills on the world stage.

This concept varies across different sports, with some allowing unlimited substitutions, while others impose limitations on the number or timing of substitutions. In this article, we will explore the different types of sports that allow free substitution, those with limited substitution, and those with mixed or hybrid systems.\n\nSports that allow free substitution\n---------------------------------\n\n### Sports that allow unlimited substitution during live play\n\nSome sports permit unlimited substitution during live play, allowing teams to replace players at any time without restrictions. Examples of such sports include:\n\n* Water polo: Players can be substituted at any time during the game, with no limit on the number of substitutions.\n* Volleyball: Teams can make substitutions during live play, and there is no limit on the number of substitutions per game.\n* Rugby sevens: Unlimited substitutions are allowed during the game, with teams often making tactical changes to gain an advantage.\n\nThese sports often have fast-paced and high-intensity gameplay, making it necessary for teams to make quick substitutions to maintain their competitiveness.\n\n### Sports that allow unlimited substitutions during stoppages of play only\n\nOther sports allow unlimited substitutions, but only during stoppages of play, such as timeouts, quarter breaks, or between periods. Examples of such sports include:\n\n* Basketball: Teams can make unlimited substitutions during timeouts and between quarters, but not during live play.\n* Football (American): Teams can make unlimited substitutions during timeouts, between quarters, and between periods, but not during live play.\n* Hockey (ice): Teams can make unlimited substitutions during stoppages of play, such as timeouts and between periods.\n\nThese sports often have more complex strategies and require teams to make tactical changes during stoppages of play to gain an advantage.\n\nSports with limited substitution\n-------------------------------\n\n### Sports that allow a limited number of substitutions\n\nSome sports impose a limit on the number of substitutions that can be made during a game. Examples of such sports include:\n\n* Football (soccer): Teams are allowed to make three substitutions per game, and these substitutions can only be made during stoppages of play.\n* Cricket: Teams are allowed to make a limited number of substitutions, known as \" concussion substitutions\", in the event of a player suffering a head injury.\n* Baseball: Teams are allowed to make a limited number of substitutions, known as \"defensive replacements\", in the late innings of a game.\n\nThese sports often have a strong emphasis on strategy and player management, and the limited number of substitutions requires teams to make careful decisions about when to make changes.\n\n### Sports that only allow substitution to replace injured players\n\nSome sports only allow substitutions to replace injured players, with no other substitutions permitted. Examples of such sports include:\n\n* Tennis: Players can only be substituted if they are injured or ill, and the substitution must be approved by the tournament referee.\n* Golf: Players can only be substituted if they are injured or ill, and the substitution must be approved by the tournament committee.\n* Athletics (track and field): Athletes can only be substituted if they are injured or ill, and the substitution must be approved by the meet organizers.\n\nThese sports often have a strong emphasis on individual performance, and the limited substitution rules require athletes to be prepared to compete at a high level without relying on substitutions.\n\nSports with mixed or hybrid systems\n------------------------------------\n\nSome sports have mixed or hybrid systems, combining elements of free substitution and limited substitution. Examples of such sports include:\n\n* Australian Rules football: Teams are allowed to make unlimited substitutions during the game, but only through a designated interchange bench.\n* Gaelic football: Teams are allowed to make a limited number of substitutions during the game, but can also make unlimited substitutions during stoppages of play.\n* Rugby league: Teams are allowed to make a limited number of substitutions during the game, but can also make unlimited substitutions during stoppages of play.\n\nThese sports often have complex rules and regulations, and the mixed or hybrid systems require teams to adapt and make strategic decisions about when to make substitutions.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Substitution (sports)\n* Team sport\n* Player management\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nThis article provides an overview of the different types of sports that allow free substitution, those with limited substitution, and those with mixed or hybrid systems.

The strike, which began on July 14, 2023, and lasted for several months, was the first major labor dispute in the entertainment industry since the 2007-2008 Writers Guild of America strike.\n\n# Background\n\n## Unionization in Hollywood\n\nThe entertainment industry has a long history of unionization, dating back to the 1920s when actors, writers, and directors first began organizing to protect their rights and interests. Over the years, various unions have formed to represent different segments of the industry, including the Screen Actors Guild (SAG), the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA), and the Writers Guild of America (WGA). In 2012, SAG and AFTRA merged to form SAG-AFTRA, which represents over 160,000 film and television actors, journalists, radio personalities, recording artists, and other media professionals.\n\n## Pre-strike activity\n\nIn the months leading up to the strike, SAG-AFTRA and the AMPTP engaged in tense negotiations over a new collective bargaining agreement. The union was seeking improved wages, benefits, and working conditions for its members, as well as increased residuals for streaming content. The producers, on the other hand, were seeking to limit the union's demands and maintain their control over the industry. As the negotiations broke down, SAG-AFTRA began preparing for a potential strike, and on June 21, 2023, the union's national board voted to authorize a strike if a deal was not reached by July 1.\n\n# Timeline\n\n## July\n\nOn July 1, 2023, SAG-AFTRA's contract with the AMPTP expired, and the two sides failed to reach an agreement. The union announced that it would begin a strike on July 14, and actors and other industry professionals began picketing outside major studios and production facilities. The strike quickly gained international attention, with many stars and industry leaders expressing their support for the union.\n\n## August\n\nIn August, the strike continued to gain momentum, with thousands of actors and industry professionals participating in rallies and pickets across the country.

The union also began to make gains in its negotiations with the AMPTP, with reports emerging that the two sides were close to reaching a deal on several key issues. On September 20, SAG-AFTRA announced that it would begin negotiating with the AMPTP on a new contract for film and television actors.\n\n## October\n\nIn October, the strike continued to have a major impact on the industry, with many productions shut down or delayed due to the lack of actors and other industry professionals. The union also announced that it would begin picketing outside major awards shows, including the Emmys and the Oscars. On October 10, SAG-AFTRA announced that it would begin negotiating with the AMPTP on a new contract for video game actors.\n\n## November\n\nIn November, the strike showed signs of fatigue, with some actors and industry professionals beginning to return to work. The union also announced that it would begin negotiating with the AMPTP on a new contract for commercial actors. On November 15, SAG-AFTRA announced that it would begin picketing outside major advertising agencies.\n\n## December\n\nIn December, the strike finally came to an end, with SAG-AFTRA and the AMPTP reaching a tentative agreement on a new collective bargaining agreement. The agreement included significant gains for the union, including improved wages, benefits, and working conditions, as well as increased residuals for streaming content.\n\n# Strike activity and responses\n\n## Locations\n\nThe strike took place at various locations across the United States and internationally, including major studios and production facilities, awards shows, and advertising agencies.

He is best known for his victory at the Battle of Gettysburg, which repelled the second invasion of the North by the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, led by General Robert E. Lee. Meade's leadership during the battle and its aftermath earned him widespread recognition and praise, and he went on to play a significant role in the ultimate defeat of the Confederacy.\n\n# Early life and education\n\nGeorge Meade was born on December 31, 1815, in Cádiz, Spain, where his father, Richard Worsam Meade, was serving as a merchant. The family returned to the United States when Meade was a young boy, and he spent most of his childhood in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Meade's father was a wealthy merchant who instilled in him a strong sense of discipline and responsibility. Meade attended the Mount Hope Institution in Baltimore, Maryland, and later graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1835, where he ranked 19th out of 56 cadets.\n\n# Topographical Corps and Mexican-American War\n\nAfter graduating from West Point, Meade was commissioned as a brevet second lieutenant in the United States Army Corps of Topographical Engineers. He spent the next several years working on various engineering projects, including the construction of lighthouses and the surveying of the Great Lakes. In 1845, Meade was promoted to the rank of first lieutenant and served as a topographical engineer in the Mexican-American War. During the war, Meade saw action in several battles, including the Battle of Palo Alto and the Battle of Monterrey. He was brevetted to the rank of captain for his service during the war.\n\n# American Civil War\n\n## Peninsula campaign\n\nWhen the American Civil War broke out in 1861, Meade was appointed as a brigadier general of volunteers and given command of a brigade in the Army of the Potomac. He saw action in the Peninsula campaign, where he was wounded at the Battle of Glendale. Meade's bravery and leadership during the battle earned him a promotion to the rank of major general.\n\n## Maryland campaign\n\nIn September 1862, Meade's division was part of the Union army that defeated the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia at the Battle of South Mountain. Meade's division played a key role in the battle, and he was praised for his leadership. However, Meade's division was not heavily engaged at the Battle of Antietam, which followed shortly after.\n\n## Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville\n\nIn December 1862, Meade's division was part of the Union army that was defeated at the Battle of Fredericksburg. Meade's division was not heavily engaged in the battle, but he was critical of the Union army's tactics and leadership. In May 1863, Meade's division was part of the Union army that was defeated at the Battle of Chancellorsville. Meade's division was not heavily engaged in the battle, but he was again critical of the Union army's tactics and leadership.\n\n## Gettysburg campaign\n\n### Command of the Army of the Potomac\n\nIn June 1863, Meade was given command of the Army of the Potomac, replacing General Joseph Hooker. Meade's appointment was unexpected, and he was given command of the army just days before the Battle of Gettysburg. Meade's leadership and organizational skills were instrumental in preparing the army for the upcoming battle.\n\n### Battle of Gettysburg\n\nThe Battle of Gettysburg was a turning point in the war, and Meade's leadership played a crucial role in the Union victory. On July 1, 1863, the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, led by General Robert E. Lee, launched a surprise attack on the Union army's left flank, driving the Union troops back through the town of Gettysburg. On July 2, Lee launched a massive assault on the Union army's center, but Meade's troops held firm. On July 3, Lee launched a final assault on the Union army's center, but it was repelled with heavy losses.\n\n### Lee's retreat\n\nAfter the Battle of Gettysburg, Meade's army pursued Lee's army as it retreated back to Virginia. Meade's army was criticized for not pursuing Lee's army more aggressively, but Meade's cautious approach was likely due to the heavy casualties his army had suffered during the battle.\n\n## Bristoe and Mine Run campaign\n\nIn the fall of 1863, Meade's army launched a series of battles against Lee's army, known as the Bristoe campaign. Meade's army was successful in driving Lee's army back, but the campaign was ultimately inconclusive. In November 1863, Meade's army launched a final attack on Lee's army, known as the Mine Run campaign, but it was repelled.\n\n## Overland campaign\n\nIn May 1864, Meade's army launched a series of battles against Lee's army, known as the Overland campaign. Meade's army was successful in driving Lee's army back, but the campaign was ultimately inconclusive. Meade's army suffered heavy casualties during the campaign, and he was criticized for his leadership.\n\n## Richmond-Petersburg campaign\n\nIn June 1864, Meade's army launched a series of battles against Lee's army, known as the Richmond-Petersburg campaign. Meade's army was successful in driving Lee's army back, but the campaign was ultimately inconclusive. Meade's army suffered heavy casualties during the campaign, and he was criticized for his leadership.\n\n## Political rivalries\n\nMeade's leadership during the war was often overshadowed by the rivalries between him and other Union generals, particularly General Ulysses S. Grant. Meade's cautious approach to battle was often at odds with Grant's more aggressive approach, and the two men had a difficult relationship. Meade's leadership was also criticized by politicians and the press, who often favored more dramatic and decisive victories.\n\n# Reconstruction\n\nAfter the war, Meade was given command of the Military District of the Atlantic, which included the states of North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. Meade's leadership during the Reconstruction era was marked by his efforts to establish order and stability in the South. He worked to ensure that the rights of African Americans were protected and that the former Confederate states were reintegrated into the Union.\n\n# Personal life\n\nMeade was married to Margaretta Sergeant Meade, and the couple had seven children together. Meade was known for his strong sense of family and his commitment to his wife and children. He was also a devout Episcopalian and attended church regularly.\n\n# Later life and death\n\nAfter the war, Meade continued to serve in the army, but he suffered from a number of health problems, including rheumatic fever and pneumonia. He died on November 6, 1872, at the age of 56, and was buried in Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\n# Legacy\n\nMeade's legacy as a military leader is complex and often debated by historians. While he is often criticized for his cautious approach to battle, he is also praised for his organizational skills and his ability to adapt to changing circumstances. Meade's leadership during the Battle of Gettysburg was instrumental in the Union victory, and he is remembered as one of the most important generals of the Civil War.\n\n## Memorials to Meade\n\nMeade is remembered through a number of memorials and tributes, including the Meade Memorial in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which was dedicated in 1887. Meade's portrait is also featured on a number of postage stamps and coins, including the 5-cent coin issued in 1891.\n\n# In popular culture\n\nMeade has been portrayed in a number of films and television shows, including the 1993 film \"Gettysburg\" and the 2011 film \"The Conspirator\". He has also been the subject of a number of books and documentaries, including the 2004 book \"Meade of Gettysburg\" by Freeman Cleaves.\n\n# Dates of rank\n\n* Second Lieutenant, United States Army Corps of Topographical Engineers, July 1, 1835\n* First Lieutenant, United States Army Corps of Topographical Engineers, September 9, 1836\n* Captain, United States Army Corps of Topographical Engineers, August 19, 1846\n* Brigadier General, United States Volunteers, August 31, 1861\n* Major General, United States Volunteers, November 29, 1862\n* Brigadier General, United States Army, January 21, 1863\n* Major General, United States Army, August 18, 1864\n\n# See also\n\n* American Civil War\n* Battle of Gettysburg\n* Gettysburg Campaign\n* Army of the Potomac\n* United States Army Corps of Topographical Engineers\n\n# References\n\n# External links\n\nNote: The article does not include any citations or references as per the requirements.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"George_Meade\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and education\n#Topographical Corps and Mexican-American War\n#American Civil War\n##Peninsula campaign\n##Maryland campaign\n##Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville\n##Gettysburg campaign\n###Command of the Army of the Potomac\n###Battle of Gettysburg\n###Lee's retreat\n##Bristoe and Mine Run campaign\n##Overland campaign\n##Richmond-Petersburg campaign\n##Political rivalries\n#Reconstruction\n#Personal life\n#Later life and death\n#Legacy\n##Memorials to Meade\n#In popular culture\n#Dates of rank\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The mobilization marked a significant escalation of Russia's involvement in the ongoing conflict with Ukraine and had far-reaching consequences for Russian society, the Russian military, and the international community.\n\n# Background\n\n## Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics\n\nIn 2014, following the Ukrainian revolution, pro-Russian separatists declared independence in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine, leading to the establishment of the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) and the Luhansk People's Republic (LPR). Since then, the regions have been the site of ongoing conflict between Ukrainian government forces and separatist militias, with Russia providing military and economic support to the latter.\n\n## Russia\n\nRussia's involvement in the conflict in Ukraine has been significant, with Russian troops and military equipment deployed in the region. However, the Russian government has consistently denied direct involvement in the conflict, instead claiming to be providing humanitarian aid and military support to the separatist regions.\n\n### Russian losses\n\nDespite the denials, Russian losses in the conflict have been substantial. According to estimates, hundreds of Russian soldiers have been killed in the fighting, and the Russian military has suffered significant equipment losses. The Russian government has also faced criticism for its handling of the conflict, with many Russians expressing concern about the country's involvement in the war.\n\n# Prelude\n\n## Volunteer recruitment campaign\n\nIn the months leading up to the mobilization, the Russian government launched a volunteer recruitment campaign, seeking to attract new recruits to the military. The campaign was aimed at increasing the number of Russian troops deployed in Ukraine and bolstering the country's military presence in the region.\n\n## Legislative changes\n\nIn May 2022, the Russian government introduced legislative changes aimed at expanding the country's military mobilization capabilities. The changes allowed the government to mobilize a wider range of citizens, including those with specialized skills and expertise.\n\n## Recruitment of prisoners\n\nIn July 2022, the Russian government announced plans to recruit prisoners to fight in Ukraine. The move was seen as a desperate attempt to bolster the country's military presence in the region and address the significant losses suffered by Russian forces.\n\n# Putin's speech\n\nOn September 21, 2022, President Putin delivered a televised address to the nation, announcing the mobilization of Russian citizens to support the country's military efforts in Ukraine. The speech marked a significant turning point in the conflict, with Putin warning of the need for increased military mobilization to counter the \"threats\" posed by Ukraine and its Western allies.\n\n# Decree\n\n## Official publication and entry into force\n\nFollowing Putin's speech, the Russian government published a decree outlining the terms of the mobilization. The decree, which entered into force on September 21, 2022, provided for the mobilization of up to 300,000 Russian citizens to support the country's military efforts in Ukraine.\n\n## Point 7\n\nPoint 7 of the decree granted the Russian Defense Ministry the authority to determine the number of citizens to be mobilized and the duration of their service. The point also allowed the ministry to recall citizens who had previously served in the military, sparking concerns about the potential for widespread mobilization.\n\n# Organization\n\n## Text of decree\n\nThe text of the decree outlined the procedures for the mobilization, including the selection of citizens, their training, and their deployment to Ukraine. The decree also provided for the establishment of a special commission to oversee the mobilization process.\n\n## Citizens to be mobilized\n\nThe decree identified a range of citizens who would be eligible for mobilization, including those with military experience, specialized skills, and expertise. The decree also allowed for the mobilization of citizens who had previously been exempt from military service, sparking concerns about the potential for widespread conscription.\n\n# Implementation\n\n## Dates\n\nThe mobilization was implemented in stages, with the first phase commencing on September 21, 2022. The Russian government announced plans to mobilize up to 300,000 citizens over the coming months, with the majority expected to be deployed to Ukraine.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## In Russia\n\n### Markets\n\nThe mobilization announcement sparked a significant decline in Russian financial markets, with the ruble plunging to a record low against the US dollar. The move also sparked concerns about the potential for economic instability and the impact on Russian businesses.\n\n### Russian officials and their families\n\nMany Russian officials and their families expressed concern about the mobilization, with some reportedly fleeing the country to avoid being called up.\n\n### Within the Russian military\n\nThe mobilization announcement sparked significant discontent within the Russian military, with many soldiers expressing concern about the potential for widespread conscription and the impact on their families.\n\n### Help for army conscripts\n\nA number of organizations and individuals offered help to army conscripts, including providing food, clothing, and other essential items.\n\n### Exodus of Russians\n\nThe mobilization announcement sparked an exodus of Russians from the country, with many fleeing to neighboring countries to avoid being called up.\n\n### Protests\n\nProtests against the mobilization broke out across Russia, with demonstrators calling for an end to the conflict in Ukraine and the withdrawal of Russian troops.\n\n### Attacks\n\nThere were reports of attacks on military recruitment centers and other government buildings, with some protesters attempting to disrupt the mobilization process.\n\n## In Ukraine\n\nThe mobilization announcement was met with concern in Ukraine, with many Ukrainians expressing fear about the potential for increased violence and instability in the region.\n\n## International\n\nThe mobilization announcement sparked widespread condemnation from the international community, with many countries expressing concern about the potential for escalation in the conflict.\n\n# Analysis\n\n## Casualties\n\nThe mobilization is expected to result in significant casualties, both among Russian troops and Ukrainian civilians. The move is also likely to exacerbate the humanitarian crisis in the region, with many civilians already displaced or affected by the conflict.\n\n# See also\n\n* 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* Donetsk People's Republic\n* Luhansk People's Republic\n* Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014–present)\n* War in Donbas (2014–2022)\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is based on publicly available information and does not reflect the views of any individual or organization.\n\n# References", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Russian_mobilization\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics\n##Russia\n###Russian losses\n#Prelude\n##Volunteer recruitment campaign\n##Legislative changes\n##Recruitment of prisoners\n#Putin's speech\n#Decree\n##Official publication and entry into force\n##Point 7\n#Organization\n##Text of decree\n##Citizens to be mobilized\n#Implementation\n##Dates\n#Reactions\n##In Russia\n###Markets\n###Russian officials and their families\n###Within the Russian military\n###Help for army conscripts\n###Exodus of Russians\n###Protests\n###Attacks\n##In Ukraine\n##International\n#Analysis\n##Casualties\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born on April 8, 1937, in Chicago, Illinois, Hersh has had a long and distinguished career in journalism, working for various newspapers and magazines, including The New York Times and The New Yorker. He is widely regarded as one of the most important investigative journalists of his generation.\n\nEarly life and education\n-------------------------\n\nHersh was born to a Jewish family in Chicago, Illinois. His father, Isador Hersh, was a salesman, and his mother, Freyda Hersh, was a homemaker. Hersh grew up in a middle-class neighborhood in Chicago and developed an interest in journalism at an early age. He attended the University of Chicago, where he studied history and graduated in 1958. After college, Hersh served in the United States Army Reserve, where he was stationed in Maryland.\n\nNewspaper career\n-----------------\n\n### My Lai massacre\n\nHersh's breakthrough story came in 1969, when he reported on the My Lai massacre, a mass killing of Vietnamese civilians by American soldiers during the Vietnam War. Hersh's investigative reporting exposed the atrocities committed by American troops and brought attention to the incident, which had been previously covered up by the military. The story made headlines around the world and earned Hersh the Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting in 1970.\n\n### The New York Times\n\nIn 1972, Hersh joined The New York Times as a investigative reporter. During his time at the Times, Hersh covered a range of topics, including the Watergate scandal and the CIA's involvement in the overthrow of the government of Chile. His reporting on the CIA's activities in Chile led to a Congressional investigation and the resignation of CIA Director Richard Helms.\n\nInvestigative books: 1980s and 1990s\n-----------------------------------\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, Hersh wrote several investigative books that exposed government secrets and military operations. His book \"The Price of Power: Kissinger in the Nixon White House\" (1983) revealed the inner workings of the Nixon administration and the role of Henry Kissinger in shaping foreign policy. \"The Samson Option: Israel's Nuclear Arsenal and American Foreign Policy\" (1991) explored Israel's nuclear program and its implications for American foreign policy.\n\nLater investigations\n--------------------\n\n### Iraq and Abu Ghraib\n\nIn 2004, Hersh reported on the Abu Ghraib prison abuse scandal, which involved American soldiers torturing and mistreating Iraqi detainees. His reporting exposed the extent of the abuse and the involvement of high-ranking military officials. Hersh also reported on the use of chemical weapons by American forces in Iraq and the presence of al-Qaeda in the country.\n\n### Iran\n\nIn 2012, Hersh reported on the Obama administration's secret dealings with Iran, including a covert operation to sabotage Iran's nuclear program. He also reported on the CIA's role in the assassination of Iranian nuclear scientists.\n\n### Syria and chemical attacks\n\nIn 2013, Hersh reported on the Syrian government's alleged use of chemical weapons against civilians. He questioned the official narrative and suggested that the attack may have been carried out by rebel forces.\n\n### Killing of Osama bin Laden\n\nIn 2015, Hersh reported on the killing of Osama bin Laden, challenging the official narrative of the operation. He suggested that the Pakistani military had been involved in the operation and that bin Laden had been living in a safe house in Abbottabad, Pakistan.\n\n### Nord Stream pipeline and Ukraine\n\nIn 2022, Hersh reported on the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipeline, suggesting that the Biden administration had been involved in the operation. He also reported on the CIA's involvement in the Ukraine conflict and the role of American intelligence agencies in shaping Ukrainian policy.\n\nOther statements\n-----------------\n\n### Speeches\n\nHersh has given several speeches and lectures on investigative journalism and government secrecy. In a 2013 speech at the University of California, Berkeley, he criticized the Obama administration's handling of national security and the role of the media in covering up government secrets.\n\n### Murder of Seth Rich\n\nIn 2017, Hersh suggested that the murder of Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich may have been connected to the WikiLeaks release of Democratic Party emails. He also questioned the official narrative of Rich's murder and suggested that the FBI may have been involved in a cover-up.\n\n### Pat Nixon abuse\n\nIn 2019, Hersh reported on allegations of physical and emotional abuse by Pat Nixon, the wife of President Richard Nixon.

The original hosts were Tito Sotto, Vic Sotto, and Joey de Leon, collectively known as the \"Tito, Vic, and Joey\" (TVJ) trio. During its early years, the show was known for its wacky humor, witty banter, and charitable causes.\n\n### ABS-CBN (1989–1995)\n\nIn 1989, E.A.T. transferred to ABS-CBN, where it continued to gain popularity and expand its audience reach.
