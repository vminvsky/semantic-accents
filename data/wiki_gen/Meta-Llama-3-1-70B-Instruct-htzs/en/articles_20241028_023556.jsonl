The law governing testate succession in South Africa is primarily found in the Wills Act 7 of 1953 and the Administration of Estates Act 66 of 1965.\n\n# Freedom of Testation\n\nThe principle of freedom of testation is a fundamental concept in South African law, which allows a person to dispose of their property as they wish after their death. However, this freedom is not absolute and is subject to certain limitations.\n\n## Limitations\n\n### Illegal Dispositions and Those Against Public Policy\n\nA testator's freedom to dispose of their property is limited by the requirement that the disposition must not be contrary to law or public policy. For example, a disposition that is intended to defraud creditors or to promote an unlawful purpose will be invalid.\n\n### Subdivision of Agricultural Land\n\nThe Subdivision of Agricultural Land Act 70 of 1970 regulates the subdivision of agricultural land, and certain dispositions may be invalid if they do not comply with the provisions of this Act.\n\n### Subdivision of Mineral Rights\n\nThe Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act 28 of 2002 regulates the subdivision of mineral rights, and certain dispositions may be invalid if they do not comply with the provisions of this Act.\n\n### Fideicommissum Multiplex\n\nA fideicommissum multiplex is a disposition that creates a series of successive interests in the same property. Such dispositions are invalid in South African law.\n\n### Maintenance of Surviving Spouse\n\nA testator's freedom to dispose of their property is also limited by the requirement that they must make provision for the maintenance of their surviving spouse. The Maintenance of Surviving Spouses Act 27 of 1990 provides that a surviving spouse is entitled to a certain proportion of the deceased's estate, unless the deceased has made adequate provision for their maintenance in their will.\n\n### Maintenance and Education of Minor Children\n\nA testator's freedom to dispose of their property is also limited by the requirement that they must make provision for the maintenance and education of their minor children. The Maintenance Act 99 of 1998 provides that a parent is responsible for the maintenance of their minor children, and a testator's failure to make provision for their minor children in their will may result in an application to the court for maintenance.\n\n### Pension Funds\n\nThe Pension Funds Act 24 of 1956 regulates the distribution of pension fund benefits after a member's death. Certain dispositions in a will may be invalid if they do not comply with the provisions of this Act.\n\n## Delegation\n\nA testator may delegate the power to administer their estate to an executor or other person. However, the testator may not delegate the power to make decisions regarding the distribution of their property.\n\n## Customary Law\n\nCustomary law plays an important role in South African law, particularly in the context of succession. The Recognition of Customary Marriages Act 120 of 1998 provides that customary marriages are recognized as valid marriages, and the Intestate Succession Act 81 of 1987 provides that the rules of customary law will apply to the distribution of an estate where the deceased died intestate.\n\n# Testamentary Capacity\n\nA testator must have the necessary mental capacity to make a valid will. The test for mental capacity is set out in the Wills Act, and a testator must be able to understand the nature and extent of their property, as well as the nature and effect of their dispositions.\n\n## Mental Ability of the Testator\n\nA testator must have the necessary mental ability to make a valid will. This includes the ability to understand the nature and extent of their property, as well as the nature and effect of their dispositions.\n\n## Undue Influence on the Testator\n\nA will may be invalid if the testator was subject to undue influence when making the will. Undue influence may be established if it can be shown that the testator was coerced or manipulated into making certain dispositions.\n\n# Capacity to Witness a Will\n\nA witness to a will must have the necessary capacity to witness the will. The witness must be able to see and hear the testator, and must be able to understand the nature and effect of the dispositions.\n\n# Formalities for Execution of a Will\n\nA will must be executed in accordance with the formalities set out in the Wills Act. This includes the requirement that the will must be in writing, and that it must be signed by the testator in the presence of two witnesses.\n\n## Requirements for a Testamentary Disposition\n\nA testamentary disposition must be in writing, and must be signed by the testator in the presence of two witnesses. The disposition must also be clear and unambiguous, and must be capable of being carried out.\n\n## Methods of Executing a Valid Will\n\nA valid will may be executed in a number of ways, including by signing the will in the presence of two witnesses, or by making a mark or thumbprint on the will in the presence of two witnesses.\n\n## Signing and Signature\n\nThe testator must sign the will in the presence of two witnesses, and the witnesses must sign the will in the presence of the testator. The signature must be made with the intention of signing the will, and must be made in the presence of the witnesses.\n\n## Certificate\n\nA certificate of execution may be attached to the will, which sets out the formalities of execution. The certificate must be signed by the witnesses, and must be attached to the will.\n\n## Witnesses\n\nTwo witnesses are required to witness the execution of a will. The witnesses must be present when the testator signs the will, and must sign the will in the presence of the testator.\n\n# Condonation\n\nA will may be invalid if the testator did not comply with the formalities set out in the Wills Act. However, the court may condone the will if it can be shown that the testator intended to make a valid will, and that the defects in the will do not affect the validity of the dispositions.\n\n# Invalid Wills\n\nA will may be invalid if it does not comply with the formalities set out in the Wills Act. An invalid will may be challenged by any person who has an interest in the estate.\n\n## Revocation\n\nA will may be revoked by the testator at any time before their death. The testator may revoke their will by making a new will, or by destroying the original will.\n\n### Right of Revocation\n\nThe testator has the right to revoke their will at any time before their death. The testator may revoke their will by making a new will, or by destroying the original will.\n\n### Manner\n\nA will may be revoked in a number of ways, including by making a new will, or by destroying the original will.\n\n#### Later Will or Codicil\n\nA later will or codicil may revoke an earlier will. The later will or codicil must be executed in accordance with the formalities set out in the Wills Act.\n\n#### Physical or Symbolic Destruction\n\nA will may be revoked by physically destroying the original will. The destruction must be intentional, and must be done with the intention of revoking the will.\n\n#### Ademption\n\nA will may be revoked by ademption, which occurs when the testator sells or gives away property that was bequeathed in the will.\n\n#### Other Means of Revocation\n\nA will may be revoked by other means, including by divorce or annulment of marriage.\n\n#### Divorce or Annulment of Marriage\n\nA will may be revoked by divorce or annulment of marriage. The divorce or annulment must be valid, and must be obtained in accordance with the laws of the country.\n\n### Exceptions to the General Rule that a Will Can be Revoked\n\nThere are certain exceptions to the general rule that a will can be revoked. For example, a will may not be revoked if it is a joint will, or if it is a will that is made in contemplation of marriage.\n\n### Revival of a Revoked Will\n\nA revoked will may be revived if the testator makes a new will that revives the earlier will. The new will must be executed in accordance with the formalities set out in the Wills Act.\n\n## Alteration or Variation\n\nA will may be altered or varied by the testator at any time before their death. The testator may alter or vary their will by making a new will, or by executing a codicil.\n\n### Amendment by Testator\n\nA will may be amended by the testator by making a new will, or by executing a codicil. The amendment must be executed in accordance with the formalities set out in the Wills Act.\n\n### Rectification by Court\n\nA will may be rectified by the court if it can be shown that the testator did not intend to make the dispositions that are set out in the will. The court may rectify the will by making an order that changes the dispositions.\n\n### Alteration or Variation by the Court\n\nA will may be altered or varied by the court if it can be shown that the testator did not intend to make the dispositions that are set out in the will. The court may alter or vary the will by making an order that changes the dispositions.\n\n## Incorporation by Reference\n\nA will may incorporate other documents by reference. The incorporation must be clear and unambiguous, and must be capable of being carried out.\n\n# Obsolete and Provincial Wills\n\nA will may be obsolete or provincial if it was made in accordance with the laws of another country or province. The will may still be valid, but it may need to be probated in accordance with the laws of the country or province where it was made.\n\n# Joint or Mutual Wills\n\nA joint or mutual will is a will that is made by two or more people. The will must be executed in accordance with the formalities set out in the Wills Act, and must be probated in accordance with the laws of the country or province where it was made.\n\n# Probate of Wills\n\nA will must be probated in accordance with the laws of the country or province where it was made. The probate process involves verifying the validity of the will, and ensuring that the dispositions are carried out.\n\n## Lost Wills\n\nA will may be lost or destroyed, but it may still be probated if it can be shown that the testator intended to make a valid will. The court may probate the will by making an order that allows the dispositions to be carried out.\n\n# Content of Wills\n\nA will may contain a number of different types of dispositions, including bequests, devises, and legacies.\n\n## Inheritance and Legacy\n\nA bequest is a gift of personal property, while a devise is a gift of real property. A legacy is a gift of money or other assets.\n\n## Prior and Legal Rights\n\nA testator may make provision for their prior and legal rights, including their right to a certain proportion of their estate.\n\n## Vested, Conditional and Future Interests\n\nA will may create vested, conditional, and future interests in property. A vested interest is an interest that is immediately available, while a conditional interest is an interest that is dependent on certain conditions being met. A future interest is an interest that will become available at some point in the future.\n\n## Vested Interests\n\nA vested interest is an interest that is immediately available. The interest must be clear and unambiguous, and must be capable of being carried out.\n\n## Conditional Interests\n\nA conditional interest is an interest that is dependent on certain conditions being met. The conditions must be clear and unambiguous, and must be capable of being carried out.\n\n### Future Interests\n\nA future interest is an interest that will become available at some point in the future. The interest must be clear and unambiguous, and must be capable of being carried out.\n\n### Valid and Invalid Conditions\n\nA condition must be valid and enforceable in order to be effective. The condition must be clear and unambiguous, and must be capable of being carried out.\n\n## Nudum Praeceptum\n\nA nudum praeceptum is a direction or instruction that is not enforceable.

The massing must be clear and unambiguous, and must be capable of being carried out.\n\n## Customary Law\n\nCustomary law plays an important role in South African law, particularly in the context of succession. The Recognition of Customary Marriages Act 120 of 1998 provides that customary marriages are recognized as valid marriages, and the Intestate Succession Act 81 of 1987 provides that the rules of customary law will apply to the distribution of an estate where the deceased died intestate.\n\n## Testamentary Devices\n\nA testamentary device is a mechanism that is used to distribute property after a person's death. Examples of testamentary devices include usufruct, substitution, and trust.\n\n### Usufruct\n\nA usufruct is a right to use and enjoy property for a certain period of time.

However, a usufruct is a right to use and enjoy property for a certain period of time, while a fideicommissum is a mechanism that allows one person to take the place of another person in a will.\n\n### Fideicommissum Residui\n\nA fideicommissum residui is a fideicommissum that takes effect after the death of the usufructuary.

The clause must be clear and unambiguous, and must be capable of being carried out.\n\n## Implied Fideicommissa\n\nAn implied fideicommissum is a fideicommissum that is implied by the terms of the will, rather than being explicitly stated. The implied fideicommissum must be clear and unambiguous, and must be capable of being carried out.\n\n### Fideicommissum Subject to a Si Sine Liberis Condition\n\nA fideicommissum may be subject to a si sine liberis condition, which means that the fideicommissum will take effect only if the beneficiary dies without children. The condition must be clear and unambiguous, and must be capable of being carried out.\n\n### Prohibitions against Alienation\n\nA prohibition against alienation is a provision that prohibits the beneficiary from selling or transferring the property. The prohibition must be clear and unambiguous, and must be capable of being carried out.\n\n## Statutory Aids to Interpretation\n\nThe Wills Act provides a number of statutory aids to interpretation, which are designed to help courts interpret the meaning of a will.

The term \"First Period\" was coined by architectural historian Abbott Lowell Cummings in the 1970s to describe the homes built in the Massachusetts Bay Colony from approximately 1625 to 1725. This article focuses on the First Period houses built between 1660 and 1679, a period of significant growth and development in the colony.\n\n## Introduction\n\nDuring the mid-17th century, Massachusetts experienced a surge in population growth, driven by the arrival of new immigrants from England. As the colony expanded, the need for housing increased, leading to the construction of many new homes. The First Period houses built during this time reflect the cultural, economic, and social context of the colony. They were designed to meet the practical needs of the colonists, while also showcasing their English heritage and social status.\n\n## 1660–1670\n\nThe First Period houses built between 1660 and 1670 were primarily constructed using traditional English building techniques, such as post-and-beam framing and wattle-and-daub infill. These homes were often small, simple, and functional, with steeply pitched roofs and central chimneys. The use of local materials, such as wood and stone, was prevalent, and the houses were often built on small plots of land.\n\n### Salem and the North Shore\n\nThe North Shore region, particularly Salem, was a hub of First Period house construction during this period. Many of the homes built in this area were influenced by the English tradition of hall-and-parlor plans, with a central chimney and two main rooms. The Jonathan Corwin House, built in 1660 in Salem, is a notable example of this style. The house features a classic hall-and-parlor plan, with a central chimney and two main rooms.\n\n### Boston and the South Shore\n\nIn contrast to the North Shore, the South Shore region, including Boston, saw the construction of more urban-style First Period houses. These homes were often built on smaller plots of land and featured more complex floor plans. The Paul Revere House, built in 1660 in Boston, is a prime example of this style. The house features a narrow, urban-style floor plan, with multiple rooms and a central chimney.\n\n## 1671–1679\n\nThe First Period houses built between 1671 and 1679 reflect the growing prosperity and sophistication of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. During this period, many of the homes built were larger and more ornate, with decorative features such as carved woodwork and ornate chimneys.\n\n### The Influence of Dutch Architecture\n\nThe First Period houses built during this period were also influenced by Dutch architecture, which was introduced to the region by Dutch immigrants. The use of gambrel roofs and flared eaves, characteristic of Dutch architecture, became more prevalent in Massachusetts during this time. The Fairbanks House, built in 1673 in Dedham, is a notable example of this style. The house features a classic gambrel roof and flared eaves, which were characteristic of Dutch architecture.\n\n### The Growth of Towns\n\nAs the Massachusetts Bay Colony continued to grow, many new towns were established, and First Period houses were built to accommodate the expanding population. The town of Concord, for example, saw significant growth during this period, with many new homes built to meet the needs of the growing community. The Old Manse, built in 1670 in Concord, is a notable example of this style. The house features a classic hall-and-parlor plan, with a central chimney and two main rooms.\n\n## See also\n\n* First Period architecture\n* Massachusetts Bay Colony\n* English country house\n* Dutch colonial architecture\n* Colonial American architecture\n\n## Notes\n\nThis article provides an overview of the First Period houses built in Massachusetts between 1660 and 1679.

The platform allows users to share text-based posts, images, and videos up to five minutes in length, with a focus on real-time updates and discussions. Threads was launched in July 2023, amidst a crowded social media landscape, and has since garnered attention for its unique features and controversies.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### Predecessor\n\nThreads is not the first social networking service developed by Meta Platforms. In 2019, the company launched a messaging app called Threads, which allowed users to share updates with their close friends. However, the app failed to gain significant traction and was eventually shut down. The new Threads platform is a distinct entity, with a broader focus on public discussions and community-building.\n\n### Development and announcement\n\nDevelopment on the new Threads platform began in 2022, with a team of engineers and designers working on the project. The service was announced in June 2023, with a launch date set for July 5, 2023. The announcement was met with significant media attention, with many outlets speculating about the platform's potential impact on the social media landscape.\n\n### Launch\n\nThreads was launched on July 5, 2023, with an initial rollout in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. The platform was available on both desktop and mobile devices, with users able to sign up using their Instagram credentials. The launch was met with significant interest, with many users eager to explore the new platform.\n\nAppearance and features\n----------------------\n\n### Possibility of open interoperability\n\nOne of the most distinctive features of Threads is its potential for open interoperability. The platform uses a proprietary protocol, but Meta Platforms has expressed interest in opening up the protocol to other developers. This could potentially allow users to share content across different platforms, creating a more seamless and interconnected social media experience.\n\n### Account integration with Instagram\n\nThreads allows users to integrate their Instagram accounts, enabling them to share content and connect with their existing followers. This integration has been seen as a key factor in the platform's growth, with many Instagram users eager to explore the new service.\n\n### Device compatibility\n\nThreads is available on a range of devices, including desktop computers, smartphones, and tablets. The platform is optimized for mobile devices, with a user-friendly interface and fast loading times.\n\n### Censorship attempts\n\nThreads has faced censorship attempts in several countries, including China and Iran. The platform's focus on real-time updates and discussions has made it a target for governments seeking to control the flow of information.\n\n### Advertising\n\nThreads has announced plans to introduce advertising on the platform, with a focus on sponsored content and branded partnerships. The company has stated that advertising revenue will be used to support the development of the platform and improve user experience.\n\nUserbase\n--------\n\n### Decline in the months after launch\n\nDespite initial interest, Threads has experienced a decline in user engagement in the months following its launch. The platform's user base has plateaued, with many users expressing frustration with the service's limitations and lack of features.\n\n### Popularity in Taiwan\n\nThreads has proven popular in Taiwan, where the platform has been used by politicians and activists to connect with citizens. The service has been seen as a key factor in the country's growing social media landscape.\n\nResponses\n----------\n\n### Intellectual property dispute\n\nThreads has been involved in an intellectual property dispute with a rival social media company, which has accused Meta Platforms of infringing on its trademark. The dispute is ongoing, with both companies refusing to comment.\n\n### Data privacy\n\nThreads has faced criticism over its data privacy policies, with many users expressing concern about the collection and use of their personal data.

Movie\n==========================\n\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie is a 1993 American science fantasy adventure film directed by Rocky Morton and Annabel Jankel, and written by Parker Bennett, Terry Runte, and Ed Solomon. The film is loosely based on the popular Super Mario video game series by Nintendo, and stars Bob Hoskins, John Leguizamo, Dennis Hopper, and Samantha Mathis. The film was released in the United States on May 28, 1993.\n\nPlot\n-----\n\nThe film takes place in a post-apocalyptic parallel universe where dinosaurs evolved into humanoid creatures, and humans are referred to as \"Invisibles\".

The nuraghi, which are the characteristic towers of the path, were built during this period as fortifications, observation points, and sacred sites. Over time, the towers were abandoned and left to ruin, but many have been restored and incorporated into the trekking route. In the 1980s, the local authorities began to develop the Path of 100 Towers as a tourist attraction, aiming to promote the island's rich cultural heritage and natural beauty.\n\n#Trekking routes\n\nThe Path of 100 Towers offers several trekking routes that cater to different levels of difficulty and interest. The most popular route is the \" Grande Traversata,\" which spans approximately 100 km and takes around 5-7 days to complete. This route takes trekkers through some of the most scenic areas of the island, including the Gennargentu National Park, the Supramonte mountain range, and the stunning beaches of the Costa Rei. Other routes include the \" Sentiero dei Nuraghi,\" which focuses on the ancient towers, and the \" Sentiero della Costa,\" which follows the coastline.\n\n#Towers\n\nThe towers, or nuraghi, are the defining feature of the Path of 100 Towers. These ancient structures were built using local limestone and granite, and range in size from simple watchtowers to complex fortifications.\n\n##Main towers\n\nSome of the most notable towers along the path include:\n\n* The Nuraghe Su Nuraxi, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the most impressive nuraghi on the island\n* The Nuraghe Arrubiu, a complex fortress with multiple towers and a stunning view of the surrounding countryside\n* The Nuraghe Santu Antine, a well-preserved tower with a unique spiral staircase\n* The Nuraghe Palmavera, a tower with a beautiful beach nearby\n\n#Flora and Fauna\n\nSardinia is known for its unique and diverse flora and fauna, which are on full display along the Path of 100 Towers.\n\n##Mediterranean scrub\n\nThe island's Mediterranean scrub, also known as \"macchia,\" is characterized by its low-growing, aromatic plants such as rosemary, thyme, and myrtle. This scrubland is home to a variety of wildlife, including the Sardinian bee-eater, the island's symbol.\n\n##Lagoon\n\nThe Path of 100 Towers also passes through several lagoons, including the Lagoon of Cagliari, which is an important stopover for migratory birds. The lagoons are home to a variety of fish and shellfish, and offer stunning views of the surrounding wetlands.\n\n#Books\n\nSeveral books have been written about the Path of 100 Towers, including guidebooks, historical accounts, and personal narratives.\n\n* \"The Path of 100 Towers: A Journey Through Sardinia's Ancient Heart\" by Alessandro Mastino\n* \"Sardinia's Nuragic Civilization: A Guide to the Towers and Fortresses\" by Giorgio Murru\n* \"Walking the Path of 100 Towers: A Personal Journey Through Sardinia\" by Jane Smith\n\n#Curiosities\n\n* The Path of 100 Towers is also known as the \" Sentiero dei Nuraghi\" or \"The Path of the Nuraghi\"\n* The nuraghi were built using local limestone and granite, which were often transported from great distances\n* The towers were often used as sacred sites, and many contain ancient artifacts and symbols\n* The Path of 100 Towers has been recognized as one of the most beautiful trekking routes in the world by several publications\n\n#Similar treks\n\n* The GR20 in Corsica, France\n* The Tour du Mont Blanc in France, Italy, and Switzerland\n* The West Highland Way in Scotland\n* The Camino de Santiago in Spain\n\n#See also\n\n* Sardinia\n* Nuragic civilization\n* Trekking\n* Hiking\n* Mediterranean scrub\n\n#Gallery\n\n[Insert images of the Path of 100 Towers, including the towers, landscapes, flora, and fauna]\n\n#References\n\n[Insert references]\n\n#External links\n\n[Insert external links]\n\nNote: The above article is a sample and may not be accurate or up-to-date.

The score features a blend of traditional African music and modern electronic elements, and was recorded with a large orchestra in Los Angeles.\n\n# Marketing\n\nThe marketing campaign for Black Panther: Wakanda Forever began in July 2022, with the release of a teaser trailer.

These gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, trap heat from the sun and prevent it from being released back into space, leading to a rise in global temperatures. The effects of climate change are far-reaching and have significant impacts on various aspects of the environment, human health, and the economy.\n\n# Changes in Temperature\n\nOne of the most direct effects of climate change is the increase in global temperatures. The average global temperature has risen by about 1°C since the late 19th century, and the 20 warmest years on record have all occurred since 1981. This warming is not uniform, with some regions experiencing more rapid warming than others. The Arctic, for example, is warming at a rate twice as fast as the global average.\n\n# Weather\n\nClimate change is also leading to changes in weather patterns, including heat waves, droughts, and extreme storms.\n\n## Heat Waves and Temperature Extremes\n\nHeat waves are becoming more frequent and prolonged, leading to increased mortality and morbidity, especially among vulnerable populations such as the elderly and young children. The intensity and duration of heat waves are expected to continue to increase as the planet warms.\n\n## Rain\n\nChanges in precipitation patterns are also occurring, with some regions experiencing more frequent and intense rainfall events, while others are experiencing droughts. This can lead to flooding, landslides, and water scarcity, affecting agriculture, industry, and human settlements.\n\n## Extreme Storms\n\nClimate change is also leading to an increase in extreme storms, including hurricanes, typhoons, and cyclones. These storms can cause catastrophic damage to infrastructure, homes, and the environment, and can also lead to loss of life.\n\n# Land\n\nThe impacts of climate change on land are numerous and varied.\n\n## Floods\n\nFlooding is becoming more frequent and severe, especially in low-lying coastal areas and river deltas. This can lead to displacement of people, damage to infrastructure and agriculture, and increased risk of waterborne diseases.\n\n## Droughts\n\nDroughts are also becoming more frequent and prolonged, leading to water scarcity, crop failures, and increased risk of wildfires.\n\n## Wildfires\n\nWildfires are becoming more frequent and intense, especially in regions with hot and dry conditions. This can lead to loss of life, property damage, and air pollution.\n\n# Oceans\n\nThe impacts of climate change on the oceans are significant and far-reaching.\n\n## Sea Level Rise\n\nSea levels are rising due to the melting of glaciers and ice sheets, and the thermal expansion of seawater. This can lead to coastal erosion, flooding, and saltwater intrusion into freshwater sources.\n\n# Ice and Snow\n\nThe impacts of climate change on ice and snow are numerous and varied.\n\n## Glaciers Decline\n\nGlaciers are shrinking and retreating, leading to changes in sea levels, water availability, and ecosystems.\n\n## Ice Sheets Decline\n\nIce sheets, such as those in Greenland and Antarctica, are also losing mass, leading to sea level rise and changes in ocean currents.\n\n## Sea Ice Decline\n\nSea ice is declining, especially in the Arctic, leading to changes in ocean currents, ecosystems, and weather patterns.\n\n## Permafrost Thawing\n\nPermafrost, or frozen ground, is thawing, leading to the release of methane and carbon dioxide, and changes in ecosystems and infrastructure.\n\n# Wildlife and Nature\n\nThe impacts of climate change on wildlife and nature are significant and far-reaching.\n\n## Ecosystems on Land\n\nEcosystems on land are being impacted by changes in temperature, precipitation, and extreme events, leading to changes in species distribution, behavior, and extinction risk.\n\n## Marine Ecosystems\n\nMarine ecosystems are also being impacted by climate change, including changes in ocean temperature, chemistry, and circulation, leading to changes in species distribution, behavior, and extinction risk.\n\n# Tipping Points and Irreversible Impacts\n\nClimate change is leading to tipping points and irreversible impacts, including the melting of ice sheets, the die-off of coral reefs, and the collapse of ecosystems.\n\n# Health, Food Security and Water Security\n\nThe impacts of climate change on human health, food security, and water security are significant and far-reaching.\n\n## Health\n\nClimate change is leading to increased risk of heat stress, waterborne diseases, and vector-borne diseases, especially among vulnerable populations.\n\n## Food Security\n\nClimate change is impacting agriculture, fisheries, and other food systems, leading to changes in food availability, access, and quality.\n\n## Water Security\n\nClimate change is impacting water availability, quality, and distribution, leading to changes in human consumption, agriculture, and industry.\n\n# Human Settlements\n\nThe impacts of climate change on human settlements are significant and varied.\n\n## Impacts from Heat\n\nHeat stress is becoming more frequent and severe, especially in urban areas, leading to increased mortality and morbidity.\n\n## Low-Lying Coastal Regions\n\nLow-lying coastal regions are becoming increasingly vulnerable to sea level rise, flooding, and saltwater intrusion, leading to displacement and migration.\n\n# Impacts on Societies\n\nThe impacts of climate change on societies are significant and far-reaching.\n\n## Displacement and Migration\n\nClimate change is leading to displacement and migration, especially in low-lying coastal areas and small island developing states.\n\n## Conflict\n\nClimate change is also leading to conflict, especially over resources such as water, land, and energy.\n\n## Social Impacts on Vulnerable Groups\n\nClimate change is having significant social impacts on vulnerable groups, including the poor, women, and indigenous communities.\n\n## Possibility of Societal Collapse\n\nClimate change is also leading to the possibility of societal collapse, especially if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise and climate change impacts become more severe.\n\n# Economic Impacts\n\nThe impacts of climate change on the economy are significant and far-reaching.\n\n## Economic Inequality\n\nClimate change is leading to economic inequality, especially between developed and developing countries, and between the rich and the poor.\n\n## Highly Affected Sectors\n\nClimate change is impacting various sectors, including agriculture, industry, and infrastructure, leading to changes in productivity, employment, and economic growth.\n\n# See

With a career spanning over three decades, Stelaru's life was marked by both artistic success and personal struggles, including a notorious death hoax and periods of censorship and obscurity.\n\n#Biography\n\n##Early life\n\nDimitrie Stelaru was born on February 5, 1917, in Bucharest, Romania, to a family of modest means. His parents, Constantin and Maria, were both musicians, and from an early age, Stelaru was exposed to traditional Romanian music and folk songs. He began singing in his local church choir and later attended the Bucharest Conservatory, where he studied music theory and voice.\n\n##Debut and death-hoax\n\nStelaru's professional music career began in the early 1930s, when he started performing in local cafes and restaurants in Bucharest. His unique voice and style quickly gained popularity, and he soon became a regular on the Romanian music scene. In 1936, Stelaru released his first single, \"Șaraiman,\" which became a moderate success.\n\nHowever, in 1938, Stelaru's life took a dramatic turn when he faked his own death in a publicity stunt gone wrong. The hoax, which was intended to boost his popularity, backfired, and Stelaru was forced to go into hiding for several months. The incident damaged his reputation, and he struggled to regain his footing in the music industry.\n\n##Albatros years\n\nIn the early 1940s, Stelaru joined the Albatros orchestra, a popular ensemble led by the renowned composer and conductor, Grigoras Dinicu. During his time with Albatros, Stelaru recorded several successful singles, including \"Cântă, cântă, băiete\" and \"Săracă inimă.\" His music from this period showcased his unique blend of traditional Romanian folk and modern styles, which would later influence the development of the manele genre.\n\n##Antonescu-era repression and late 1940s\n\nDuring World War II, Romania was ruled by the authoritarian regime of Marshal Ion Antonescu. The regime's strict censorship and repression of artistic expression made it difficult for Stelaru to continue his music career. He was forced to adapt to the regime's demands and perform patriotic and propaganda songs, which compromised his artistic integrity.\n\nAfter the war, Stelaru struggled to regain his popularity in a rapidly changing musical landscape. The rise of communism in Romania led to increased censorship, and Stelaru's music was deemed too folk-oriented and not revolutionary enough. He continued to perform and record music, but his output was severely limited by the communist authorities.\n\n##Censoring and obscurity\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, Stelaru's music was largely forgotten, and he was forced to work outside of the music industry. He took on various jobs, including working as a taxi driver and a salesman, to support himself. The communist regime's strict control over artistic expression made it impossible for Stelaru to revive his music career.\n\n##Final return\n\nIn the 1980s, with the relaxation of communist controls, Stelaru was able to return to the music scene. He began performing again, and his music experienced a resurgence in popularity. His final years were marked by a renewed appreciation for his contributions to Romanian music, and he was celebrated as a pioneer of the manele genre.\n\n#Legacy\n\nDimitrie Stelaru's legacy is complex and multifaceted. His music played a significant role in shaping the development of the manele genre, which would go on to influence generations of Romanian musicians. Despite the challenges he faced during his career, Stelaru remained committed to his art, and his music continues to be celebrated for its unique blend of traditional and modern styles.\n\nStelaru's life and career also serve as a testament to the power of perseverance and artistic expression. Despite facing censorship, repression, and obscurity, he continued to create music, and his final return to the scene was a triumph. Today, Stelaru is remembered as a pioneering figure in Romanian music, and his legacy continues to inspire new generations of musicians and fans.\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is a comprehensive overview of Dimitrie Stelaru's life and career. Further research is needed to fully explore the complexities of his life and the impact of his music on Romanian culture.\n\n#References\n\nThis article does not include references.

She is the longest-reigning British monarch in history, having served for over 70 years.\n\n#Early life\n\nElizabeth was born in London, England, to Prince Albert, Duke of York (later King George VI), and his wife, Elizabeth, Duchess of York (later Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother). At the time of her birth, Elizabeth was third in line to the throne, after her uncle Edward, Prince of Wales, and her father. She was christened Elizabeth Alexandra Mary on 29 May 1926, in the private chapel of Buckingham Palace.\n\nElizabeth's early life was spent at 145 Piccadilly, her parents' London home, and at the Royal Lodge, Windsor. She was educated at home, with a governess and private tutors, and developed a passion for dogs, horses, and the outdoors. Elizabeth's sister, Princess Margaret, was born in 1930, and the two princesses were extremely close.\n\n#Heir presumptive\n\n##Second World War\n\nDuring the Second World War, Elizabeth's uncle Edward, Prince of Wales, caused a constitutional crisis by announcing his intention to marry Wallis Simpson, an American divorcee. As the head of the Church of England, the monarch was not allowed to marry a divorced person whose former spouse was still alive. Edward's decision led to his abdication in December 1936, and Elizabeth's father became King George VI. Elizabeth became the heir presumptive, meaning she would inherit the throne if her father died or was unable to reign.\n\n##Marriage\n\nElizabeth met her future husband, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, in 1934, when she was just eight years old. Philip was a prince of Greece and Denmark, and he had been exiled from his home country after a military coup. Elizabeth and Philip began exchanging letters, and their relationship blossomed. They became engaged in 1947, and married on 20 November 1947, at Westminster Abbey.\n\n#Reign\n\n##Accession and coronation\n\nElizabeth's father, King George VI, died on 6 February 1952, and Elizabeth ascended to the throne at the age of 25. She was crowned Queen Elizabeth II on 2 June 1953, at Westminster Abbey. The coronation was a grand affair, attended by dignitaries from around the world, and was broadcast on television for the first time.\n\n##Early reign\n\nElizabeth's early reign was marked by a series of high-profile events, including the coronation and the Queen's first Commonwealth tour, which took place in 1953-1954. She visited Australia, New Zealand, and the Pacific Islands, and was greeted with widespread enthusiasm. Elizabeth also began to take on more formal duties, including the weekly meetings with her prime minister and the signing of state documents.\n\n##Political reforms and crises\n\nElizabeth's reign has seen numerous political reforms and crises, including the decolonization of Africa and Asia, the Suez Crisis, and the Falklands War. She has also played a key role in promoting British interests abroad, and has undertaken numerous state visits to countries around the world.\n\n##Perils and dissent\n\nElizabeth has faced numerous challenges and controversies during her reign, including the assassination of her cousin, Lord Mountbatten, in 1979, and the attempted assassination of her husband, Prince Philip, in 1974. She has also faced criticism for her handling of the Falklands War, and for her decision to pay income tax voluntarily.\n\n##Turbulent years\n\nThe 1990s were a turbulent time for Elizabeth, with the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the rise of nationalism in Eastern Europe. She also faced personal challenges, including the death of her father-in-law, Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark, and the divorce of her son, Charles, Prince of Wales.\n\n##Dawn of the new millennium\n\nElizabeth's reign has also seen numerous milestones and celebrations, including the Millennium Dome, the Queen's Golden Jubilee, and the London Olympics. She has also become more comfortable with the use of technology, and has begun to use social media to communicate with her subjects.\n\n##Diamond Jubilee and milestones\n\nElizabeth's Diamond Jubilee was celebrated in 2012, marking 60 years on the throne. The celebrations included a river pageant on the Thames, a concert at Buckingham Palace, and a series of events around the Commonwealth. Elizabeth also became the longest-reigning British monarch in history, surpassing Queen Victoria's record.\n\n##Pandemic and widowhood\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on Elizabeth's reign, with the Queen and her husband, Prince Philip, isolating at Windsor Castle. Prince Philip died on 9 April 2021, at the age of 99, and Elizabeth was left to mourn the loss of her husband of 73 years.\n\n##Platinum Jubilee and beyond\n\nElizabeth's Platinum Jubilee was celebrated in 2022, marking 70 years on the throne. The celebrations included a series of events around the Commonwealth, as well as a concert at Buckingham Palace.\n\n#Death\n\nElizabeth II died on 8 September 2022, at Balmoral Castle, Scotland, at the age of 96.\n\n#Legacy\n\nElizabeth's legacy is complex and multifaceted, reflecting her long and eventful reign. She has been a constant presence in British life, and has played a key role in promoting British interests abroad.\n\n##Beliefs, activities, and interests\n\nElizabeth is a devout Christian, and has spoken publicly about the importance of her faith.

The scheme aims to provide an opportunity for young individuals to serve in the armed forces for a short period, while also addressing the issues of age and pension liabilities. The scheme has been met with both praise and criticism, with some hailing it as a revolutionary step and others expressing concerns about its impact on the armed forces and the country.\n\n#Background\n\nThe Indian Armed Forces have been facing several challenges in recent years, including an increasing age profile, pension liabilities, and difficulties in attracting young recruits. The average age of soldiers in the Indian Army is around 32 years, which is higher than the global average. This has resulted in a significant proportion of the defense budget being spent on pension liabilities, rather than on modernization and equipment.\n\nIn an effort to address these challenges, the Government of India announced the Agnipath Scheme in June 2022. The scheme aims to recruit young individuals, aged between 17.5 and 23 years, for a short period of four years, with the option to extend for a further 15 years. The scheme is designed to provide an opportunity for young individuals to serve in the armed forces, while also addressing the issues of age and pension liabilities.\n\n#Overview\n\nThe Agnipath Scheme is a short-term recruitment program for the Indian Armed Forces. Under the scheme, young individuals, aged between 17.5 and 23 years, will be recruited for a period of four years. During this period, they will undergo training and serve in the armed forces. At the end of the four-year period, 25% of the recruits will be retained in the armed forces, while the remaining 75% will be discharged.\n\nThe recruits will be known as \"Agniveers\" and will be eligible for a range of benefits, including a monthly salary, allowances, and medical benefits. They will also be eligible for a lump sum payment of ₹11.71 lakh upon completion of their four-year tenure.\n\n#Reservation and welfare benefits\n\nThe Agnipath Scheme provides several reservation and welfare benefits for the recruits. 10% of the vacancies will be reserved for ex-servicemen, while 10% will be reserved for candidates from the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. 5% of the vacancies will be reserved for candidates with disabilities.\n\nThe recruits will also be eligible for a range of welfare benefits, including medical benefits, housing benefits, and education benefits. They will also be eligible for a lump sum payment of ₹11.71 lakh upon completion of their four-year tenure.\n\n#Criticism\n\nThe Agnipath Scheme has been met with criticism from several quarters, including political parties, activists, retired defense personnel, and state governments.\n\n##By political parties and activists\n\nSeveral opposition parties, including the Congress, the Trinamool Congress, and the Aam Aadmi Party, have criticized the Agnipath Scheme. They argue that the scheme will lead to a lack of job security and pension benefits for the recruits. They also argue that the scheme will lead to a shortage of skilled personnel in the armed forces.\n\nActivists have also criticized the Agnipath Scheme, arguing that it will lead to a lack of accountability and transparency in the recruitment process. They argue that the scheme will lead to a lack of opportunities for young individuals from marginalized communities.\n\n##By retired defence personnel\n\nSeveral retired defense personnel have criticized the Agnipath Scheme, arguing that it will lead to a lack of job security and pension benefits for the recruits. They argue that the scheme will lead to a shortage of skilled personnel in the armed forces.\n\nThey also argue that the scheme will lead to a lack of esprit de corps and unit cohesion in the armed forces. They argue that the scheme will lead to a lack of opportunities for young individuals to serve in the armed forces for a longer period.\n\n##By state governments\n\nSeveral state governments, including the governments of Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, and West Bengal, have criticized the Agnipath Scheme. They argue that the scheme will lead to a lack of job security and pension benefits for the recruits. They also argue that the scheme will lead to a shortage of skilled personnel in the armed forces.\n\n##Data on employment of veterans\n\nAccording to data released by the Ministry of Defence, the employment rate of veterans has been declining in recent years. In 2019-2020, the employment rate of veterans was 44.4%, which declined to 34.6% in 2020-2021.\n\nThe data also shows that the majority of veterans are employed in the private sector, with 64.1% of veterans employed in the private sector in 2020-2021.\n\n#Protests\n\nThe Agnipath Scheme has been met with protests from several quarters, including opposition parties, activists, and retired defense personnel.\n\n##Bharat Bandh (All India Strike)\n\nOn June 20, 2022, a Bharat Bandh was called by several opposition parties, including the Congress, the Trinamool Congress, and the Aam Aadmi Party, to protest against the Agnipath Scheme. The strike was observed in several states, including Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, and Bihar.\n\n##21 June onwards\n\nFrom June 21, 2022, onwards, protests were held in several states, including Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, and Bihar. The protests were led by opposition parties, activists, and retired defense personnel.\n\nThe protests were marked by violence and clashes between protesters and security forces. Several protesters were injured, and several were arrested.\n\n#Response by the Government\n\nThe Government of India has defended the Agnipath Scheme, arguing that it will provide an opportunity for young individuals to serve in the armed forces. The government has also argued that the scheme will lead to a reduction in pension liabilities and an increase in the efficiency of the armed forces.\n\nThe government has also announced several measures to address the concerns of the recruits, including a lump sum payment of ₹11.71 lakh upon completion of their four-year tenure.\n\n#Plea in the Supreme Court against the scheme\n\nA plea has been filed in the Supreme Court against the Agnipath Scheme, arguing that it is unconstitutional and violative of the rights of the recruits. The plea argues that the scheme will lead to a lack of job security and pension benefits for the recruits.\n\nThe Supreme Court has issued a notice to the Government of India, seeking its response to the plea.\n\n#First Agniveer batch (2023)\n\nThe first Agniveer batch was inducted into the Indian Armed Forces in 2023.\n\n##Hyderabad\n\nThe first Agniveer batch was inducted into the Indian Army at the Artillery Centre in Hyderabad on January 16, 2023. The batch consisted of 1,000 recruits, who underwent training for 24 weeks.\n\n##Nashik\n\nThe first Agniveer batch was inducted into the Indian Air Force at the Air Force Station in Nashik on January 17, 2023. The batch consisted of 300 recruits, who underwent training for 24 weeks.\n\n##Ranikhet\n\nThe first Agniveer batch was inducted into the Indian Navy at the Naval Academy in Ranikhet on January 18, 2023. The batch consisted of 200 recruits, who underwent training for 24 weeks.\n\n#Amendment in recruitment procedure\n\nThe Government of India has announced an amendment in the recruitment procedure for the Agnipath Scheme. The amendment provides for the recruitment of candidates who have completed their Class 10 and Class 12 examinations.\n\nThe amendment also provides for the recruitment of candidates who have completed their graduation degrees.\n\n#See also\n\n* Indian Armed Forces\n* Recruitment in the Indian Armed Forces\n* Pension liabilities in India\n\n#References\n\n* \"Agnipath Scheme: A New Era for the Indian Armed Forces\" by the Ministry of Defence\n* \"Agnipath Scheme: A Game-Changer for the Indian Armed Forces\" by the Indian Express\n* \"Agnipath Scheme: A Revolutionary Step for the Indian Armed Forces\" by the Times of India\n\n#External links\n\n* Official website of the Agnipath Scheme\n* Official website of the Indian Armed Forces\n* Official website of the Ministry of Defence", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Agnipath_Scheme\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Overview\n#Reservation and welfare benefits\n#Criticism\n##By political parties and activists\n##By retired defence personnel\n##By state governments\n##Data on employment of veterans\n#Protests\n##Bharat Bandh (All India Strike)\n##21 June onwards\n#Response by the Government\n#Plea in the Supreme Court against the scheme\n#First Agniveer batch (2023)\n##Hyderabad\n##Nashik\n##Ranikhet\n#Amendment in recruitment procedure\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Her case drew widespread attention due to the unprecedented nature of the crimes and the subsequent investigation.\n\n#Early life and education\nLucy Letby was born in 1990 in Hereford, England. She grew up in a normal family environment and was educated at a local comprehensive school. Letby developed an interest in nursing at a young age and pursued a career in the field. She trained as a nurse at the University of Chester and began working at the Countess of Chester Hospital in 2011.\n\n#Career\nLetby started her career as a student nurse at the Countess of Chester Hospital in 2011. She worked on the hospital's neonatal unit, caring for premature and critically ill babies. Letby was reportedly well-liked by her colleagues and was considered to be a competent and caring nurse. However, concerns began to arise about her behavior and the high number of unexpected deaths and near-misses on the unit.\n\n#Initial investigations\nIn 2015, the hospital launched an investigation into a series of unexplained deaths and near-misses on the neonatal unit. The investigation was prompted by concerns from staff members about the high number of incidents and the potential for a link between them. Letby was not initially suspected of any wrongdoing, but her behavior and actions were scrutinized as part of the investigation.\n\n#2023 trial\nIn 2023, Letby went on trial at Manchester Crown Court, charged with murdering seven babies and attempting to murder six others. The trial was highly publicized due to the shocking nature of the allegations and the unprecedented number of victims.\n\n##Evidence\nThe prosecution presented a range of evidence against Letby, including handwritten notes, medical records, and testimony from colleagues and experts.\n\n###Handwritten notes\nLetby's handwritten notes were a key piece of evidence in the trial. The notes, which were written in a personal diary, detailed Letby's thoughts and feelings about her work on the neonatal unit. They also included references to the deaths and near-misses that occurred on the unit during her shift. The prosecution argued that the notes revealed a pattern of behavior that was consistent with Letby's guilt.\n\n###Medical records\nThe prosecution also presented medical records that showed a high number of unexpected deaths and near-misses on the neonatal unit during Letby's shifts. The records included details of the medical treatments given to the babies and the outcomes of those treatments. The prosecution argued that the records showed a clear pattern of Letby's involvement in the incidents.\n\n##Letby's testimony\nLetby took the stand in her own defense, denying any wrongdoing and claiming that she was innocent. She testified that she had always acted in the best interests of her patients and that she had never intentionally harmed anyone.\n\n##Defence arguments\nLetby's defense team argued that the prosecution's case was circumstantial and that there was no direct evidence of Letby's guilt. They also argued that the handwritten notes and medical records could be interpreted in different ways and that they did not necessarily prove Letby's involvement in the incidents.\n\n##Verdicts and sentencing\nAfter deliberating for several days, the jury delivered guilty verdicts on all counts. Letby was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 25 years.\n\n#Motives\nThe investigation and trial did not reveal a clear motive for Letby's actions. However, it is thought that she may have been motivated by a desire for attention and a need to feel important. Letby's handwritten notes and behavior on the neonatal unit suggested that she may have had a fascination with death and the dying process.\n\n#Post-conviction\nFollowing Letby's conviction, there were several developments in the case.\n\n##Disciplinary action\nThe Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) took disciplinary action against Letby, striking her off the nursing register.\n\n##Appeal\nLetby's defense team lodged an appeal against her conviction, arguing that the trial was unfair and that the jury was misdirected.\n\n##Retrial\nThe appeal was refused, and Letby's conviction was upheld.\n\n##Further investigations\nThe National Health Service (NHS) launched a further investigation into the incidents at the Countess of Chester Hospital, looking at the broader issues surrounding Letby's behavior and the hospital's response to the incidents.\n\n##Thirlwall inquiry\nThe NHS also established an independent inquiry, led by Dr. Bill Kirkup, to examine the events surrounding Letby's actions and the hospital's response. The inquiry, known as the Thirlwall inquiry, published its report in 2023, making several recommendations for improving patient safety and preventing similar incidents in the future.\n\n#Reactions\nThe case drew widespread attention and reaction, with many calling for greater regulation and reform in the healthcare sector.\n\n##Calls for regulation and reform\nThere were calls for greater regulation and reform in the healthcare sector, particularly in relation to the recruitment and vetting of healthcare staff. The case also highlighted the need for greater transparency and accountability in the NHS.\n\n#Safety of the convictions\nThere have been concerns about the safety of Letby's convictions, with some experts questioning the medical evidence and the statistical analysis used in the trial.\n\n##Concerns about the medical evidence\nThere were concerns about the medical evidence presented in the trial, particularly in relation to the use of insulin and the administration of air via nasogastric tubes.\n\n###Insulin\nSome experts questioned the use of insulin as a potential cause of the deaths and near-misses, arguing that it was unlikely to have been administered in the doses suggested by the prosecution.\n\n###Air via nasogastric tube\nThere were also concerns about the administration of air via nasogastric tubes, with some experts arguing that it was unlikely to have caused the deaths and near-misses.\n\n###Air embolism\nThe prosecution's case also relied on the possibility of air embolism, but some experts argued that this was unlikely to have occurred in the circumstances described.\n\n##Quality of the statistical evidence\nThere were concerns about the quality of the statistical evidence presented in the trial, with some experts arguing that it was flawed and did not support the prosecution's case.\n\n##Staff and infrastructure issues\nThere were also concerns about the staffing and infrastructure issues on the neonatal unit, with some experts arguing that these may have contributed to the incidents.\n\n##Timeline\nThere were concerns about the timeline of events, particularly in relation to the X-ray timing and the mislabelling of door swipe data.\n\n###X-ray timing\nSome experts questioned the timing of the X-rays, arguing that they may have been taken too late to detect any potential issues.\n\n###Mislabelled door swipe data\nThere were also concerns about the mislabelling of door swipe data, which may have affected the prosecution's case.\n\n##Interpretation of handwritten notes\nThere were concerns about the interpretation of Letby's handwritten notes, with some experts arguing that they could be interpreted in different ways.\n\n##Criticism of witnesses\nThere was criticism of some of the witnesses who testified in the trial, with some experts arguing that they may have been inconsistent or unreliable.\n\n##Reaction to doubt\nDespite the concerns about the safety of the convictions, there has been no official reaction to the doubts raised by experts and commentators.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Lucy_Letby\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and education\n#Career\n#Initial investigations\n#2023 trial\n##Evidence\n###Handwritten notes\n###Medical records\n##Letby's testimony\n##Defence arguments\n##Verdicts and sentencing\n#Motives\n#Post-conviction\n##Disciplinary action\n##Appeal\n##Retrial\n##Further investigations\n##Thirlwall inquiry\n#Reactions\n##Calls for regulation and reform\n#Safety of the convictions\n##Concerns about the medical evidence\n###Insulin\n###Air via nasogastric tube\n###Air embolism\n##Quality of the statistical evidence\n##Staff and infrastructure issues\n##Timeline\n###X-ray timing\n###Mislabelled door swipe data\n##Interpretation of handwritten notes\n##Criticism of witnesses\n##Reaction to doubt\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The incident sparked widespread unrest and protests across France, with many criticizing the police's use of force and alleging racism.\n\n# Background\n\nNanterre, where the incident occurred, is a diverse suburb with a significant immigrant population. The area has experienced social and economic tensions, including high levels of unemployment and poverty. The relationship between the local community and the police has been strained, with some residents accusing the police of harassment and brutality.\n\n# Victim\n\nNahel Merzouk was a 17-year-old high school student who lived in Nanterre. He was of Algerian descent and was born and raised in France. According to his family and friends, Nahel was a quiet and respectful young man who was well-liked in his community. He was a student at a local high school and was planning to pursue a career in sports.\n\n## Shooting\n\nOn June 27, 2023, Nahel Merzouk was shot and killed by a police officer in Nanterre. The incident occurred during a traffic stop, and the circumstances surrounding the shooting are disputed.\n\n### Prosecution version\n\nAccording to the prosecution, Nahel Merzouk was driving a car with two passengers when he was stopped by the police for a traffic violation. The police officer claimed that Nahel Merzouk attempted to drive away, and he was forced to shoot him in self-defense. The prosecution alleged that Nahel Merzouk was unarmed but had attempted to grab the police officer's gun.\n\n### Police version challenged by a video\n\nHowever, a video of the incident, which was widely shared on social media, appears to contradict the police's version of events. The video shows the police officer shooting Nahel Merzouk, who was sitting in the driver's seat, from close range. The video does not show Nahel Merzouk attempting to drive away or grab the police officer's gun.\n\n### Version from the third passenger\n\nOne of the passengers in the car, who was not injured during the incident, gave a different account of what happened. According to the passenger, the police officer approached the car and ordered Nahel Merzouk to get out. Nahel Merzouk complied, but the police officer shot him anyway. The passenger claimed that Nahel Merzouk was unarmed and did not pose a threat to the police officer.\n\n# Investigation\n\nAn investigation into the shooting was launched, and the police officer who shot Nahel Merzouk was placed on administrative leave. The investigation is ongoing, and it is unclear when the results will be released.\n\n# Initial reactions\n\nThe killing of Nahel Merzouk sparked widespread outrage and protests across France. Many criticized the police's use of force and alleged racism. The incident was widely condemned by politicians, including the French President, who promised a thorough investigation.\n\n## Polemics on immigration\n\nThe incident also sparked a heated debate about immigration and racism in France. Some politicians and commentators argued that the incident was a symptom of a broader problem of racism and xenophobia in French society. Others argued that the incident was an isolated event and that the police officer's actions were justified.\n\n# Unrest\n\nThe killing of Nahel Merzouk sparked widespread unrest and protests across France. Rioters clashed with police, and several buildings were set on fire. The unrest continued for several days, with many protesters demanding justice for Nahel Merzouk and calling for an end to police brutality.\n\n# See also\n\n* Police brutality in France\n* Racism in France\n* Immigration to France\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a factual account of the killing of Nahel Merzouk and the subsequent unrest.

It is a powerful tool for solving problems that involve cumulative sums and range queries. In this article, we will explore the motivation behind the Fenwick tree, its description, and its applications.\n\nMotivation\n-----------\n\nThe Fenwick tree was first introduced by Peter Fenwick in 1994 as a solution to the problem of efficiently calculating prefix sums in an array. Prefix sums are a fundamental concept in computer science, and they have numerous applications in fields such as data analysis, scientific computing, and machine learning. However, calculating prefix sums using traditional methods can be time-consuming, especially for large datasets.\n\nThe Fenwick tree addresses this problem by providing a data structure that allows for efficient calculation of prefix sums and updates. It achieves this by using a combination of binary representation and tree-like structure, which enables fast querying and updating of elements.\n\nDescription\n-----------\n\nThe Fenwick tree is a data structure that consists of three main components: the interrogation tree, the update tree, and the search tree. Each component plays a crucial role in the functioning of the Fenwick tree.\n\n### The Interrogation Tree\n\nThe interrogation tree is the core component of the Fenwick tree. It is a binary tree-like structure that represents the array elements in a compact form. Each node in the interrogation tree corresponds to a range of elements in the original array, and the value stored in each node is the cumulative sum of the elements in that range.\n\nThe interrogation tree is constructed by iterating over the array elements and calculating the cumulative sum at each position. The cumulative sum is then stored in the corresponding node of the interrogation tree.\n\n### The Update Tree\n\nThe update tree is a companion structure to the interrogation tree. It is used to update the elements in the array and to maintain the consistency of the interrogation tree.\n\nWhen an element in the array is updated, the update tree is used to propagate the changes to the affected nodes in the interrogation tree. The update tree is constructed by iterating over the array elements and calculating the difference between the new and old values.\n\n### The Search Tree\n\nThe search tree is used to efficiently locate the affected nodes in the interrogation tree when an update is made. It is a binary search tree that maps the array indices to the corresponding nodes in the interrogation tree.\n\nThe search tree is constructed by iterating over the array elements and inserting the indices into the tree. The search tree is used to quickly locate the nodes that need to be updated when an element in the array is changed.\n\nPseudocode\n----------\n\n### Construction\n\nThe following pseudocode illustrates the construction of the Fenwick tree:\n```\nfunction constructFenwickTree(arr)\n  interrogationTree = new array(arr.length + 1)\n  updateTree = new array(arr.length + 1)\n  searchTree = new binarySearchTree()\n\n  for i from 1 to arr.length\n    cumulativeSum = 0\n    for j from i to 1\n      cumulativeSum += arr[j]\n      interrogationTree[i] = cumulativeSum\n      updateTree[i] = 0\n      searchTree.insert(i, i)\n\n  return interrogationTree, updateTree, searchTree\n```\nSee Also\n--------\n\n* Binary Indexed Tree\n* Cumulative Sum\n* Range Query\n* Binary Search Tree\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n* Fenwick, P.

During the audit, Evelyn is suddenly and inexplicably thrust into a parallel universe, where she is confronted by a version of her husband who is more confident and charismatic.\n\nAs Evelyn navigates this new reality, she discovers that she can access multiple parallel universes, each with their own unique versions of herself and those around her. She must use this newfound ability to prevent a catastrophic threat to the multiverse, known as \"Jobu Tupaki,\" which threatens to destroy all of existence.\n\nAlong the way, Evelyn encounters a variety of bizarre and fantastical worlds, each with their own unique rules and logic. She must also confront her own personal demons and relationships, including her complicated relationship with her daughter, Joy (Stephanie Hsu), and her own sense of identity and purpose.\n\n# Cast\n\n* Michelle Yeoh as Evelyn Wang\n* Ke Huy Quan as Waymond Wang\n* Jenny Slate as Big Nose\n* Harry Shum Jr. as Chad\n* Jamie Lee Curtis as Deirdre Beaubeirdre\n* Stephanie Hsu as Joy Wang\n\n# Production\n\n## Development\n\nThe idea for Everything Everywhere All at Once was conceived by Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, who are known for their work on the film Swiss Army Man. The two directors were inspired by the concept of the multiverse and the idea of exploring the infinite possibilities of existence.\n\nKwan and Scheinert spent several years developing the script, which went through numerous drafts and revisions. They drew inspiration from a wide range of sources, including science fiction, fantasy, and Asian-American culture.\n\n## Casting\n\nMichelle Yeoh was the first actor to be cast in the film, and she was instrumental in helping to develop the script and character of Evelyn Wang. Ke Huy Quan, who had previously appeared in films such as The Goonies and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, was cast as Waymond Wang, Evelyn's husband.\n\nThe rest of the cast, including Jenny Slate, Harry Shum Jr., and Jamie Lee Curtis, were cast in supporting roles. Stephanie Hsu, who plays Evelyn's daughter Joy, was a relative newcomer to film at the time of casting.\n\n## Filming\n\nPrincipal photography on Everything Everywhere All at Once began in January 2020 and lasted for several months. The film was shot on location in Los Angeles and Simi Valley, California.\n\nKwan and Scheinert used a variety of unconventional techniques to capture the film's unique visuals, including the use of practical effects and elaborate set designs. The film's cinematographer, Larkin Seiple, used a combination of digital and film cameras to capture the film's distinctive look.\n\n## Visual effects\n\nThe visual effects in Everything Everywhere All at Once were created by a team of artists and technicians led by visual effects supervisor, Zak Stoltz. The team used a combination of computer-generated imagery (CGI) and practical effects to create the film's elaborate and fantastical worlds.\n\nThe film's visual effects were designed to be highly stylized and exaggerated, with a focus on creating a sense of wonder and excitement. The team used a variety of techniques, including 3D modeling and animation, to bring the film's characters and worlds to life.\n\n# Themes\n\nEverything Everywhere All at Once explores a number of themes, including identity, culture, and the multiverse. The film is a celebration of Asian-American culture and identity, and it features a predominantly Asian-American cast.\n\nThe film also explores the concept of the multiverse, and the idea that every possibility exists in some form or another. This theme is reflected in the film's use of parallel universes and alternate realities, which allow the characters to explore different versions of themselves and their relationships.\n\n# Music\n\nThe score for Everything Everywhere All at Once was composed by Son Lux, a experimental rock band from New York City. The score is highly eclectic and features a wide range of influences, from electronic music to classical music.\n\nThe film's soundtrack also features a number of songs by other artists, including a rendition of \"This Is Life\" by Dean Fujioka and a cover of \"Clair de Lune\" by Claude Debussy.\n\n# Release\n\n## Theatrical\n\nEverything Everywhere All at Once was released in theaters on March 25, 2022, by A24. The film received a limited release, opening in only a handful of theaters in major cities such as New York and Los Angeles.\n\nDespite its limited release, the film received widespread critical acclaim and quickly gained a cult following. The film's success led to a wider release, and it eventually opened in hundreds of theaters across the United States.\n\n## Home media\n\nEverything Everywhere All at Once was released on Blu-ray and DVD on July 5, 2022, by A24 and Lionsgate Home Entertainment. The film's home media release features a number of bonus features, including deleted scenes and a behind-the-scenes documentary.\n\n# Reception\n\n## Box office\n\nEverything Everywhere All at Once was a commercial success, grossing over $100 million at the box office worldwide. The film's success was fueled by its critical acclaim and positive word-of-mouth, which helped to attract a wide and diverse audience.\n\n## Critical response\n\nEverything Everywhere All at Once received widespread critical acclaim, with many critics praising its originality, creativity, and performances. The film holds a 95% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 8.6/10.\n\nThe film's critical success was not limited to its artistic merits, as it also received widespread recognition for its cultural significance and impact. The film was hailed as a landmark moment in Asian-American cinema, and it helped to pave the way for greater representation and diversity in the film industry.\n\n## Legacy\n\nEverything Everywhere All at Once has had a lasting impact on popular culture, inspiring countless memes, fan art, and cosplay. The film's influence can be seen in a wide range of creative works, from music videos to fashion designs.\n\nThe film's legacy extends beyond its cultural impact, as it has also helped to inspire a new generation of filmmakers and artists.

Robert Oppenheimer\n\nJ. Robert Oppenheimer was an American theoretical physicist and director of the Manhattan Project, the secret research and development project that produced the atomic bomb during World War II. He is often referred to as the \"father of the atomic bomb\" for his role in leading the team of scientists who developed this powerful and destructive technology.\n\n#Early life\n\n##Childhood and education\n\nJulius Robert Oppenheimer was born on April 22, 1904, in New York City to Ella and Julius Oppenheimer. His father, Julius, was a textile importer who had immigrated to the United States from Germany in 1888. Oppenheimer's early life was marked by a privileged upbringing, with his family residing in a luxurious apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. He was the first of two children, with a younger brother named Frank.\n\nOppenheimer's interest in science began at an early age, encouraged by his parents who provided him with a chemistry set and a microscope. He attended the Ethical Culture School in New York City, where he excelled academically and developed a passion for learning. In 1921, he enrolled at Harvard University, where he studied chemistry and physics.\n\n##Studies in Europe\n\nAfter graduating from Harvard in 1925, Oppenheimer traveled to Europe to pursue further studies. He spent a year at the University of Cambridge, where he worked under the supervision of J.J. Thomson, a renowned physicist. In 1927, he moved to the University of Göttingen in Germany, where he earned his Ph.D. in physics under the supervision of Max Born.\n\nDuring his time in Europe, Oppenheimer met and befriended many prominent physicists, including Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg, and Erwin Schrödinger. These relationships would later prove influential in his career as a theoretical physicist.\n\n#Early career\n\n##Teaching\n\nIn 1929, Oppenheimer returned to the United States and began teaching physics at the University of California, Berkeley. He quickly established himself as a talented and charismatic instructor, attracting a devoted following of students. In 1931, he was appointed as a professor of physics at the University of California, where he would remain until 1942.\n\n##Scientific work\n\nDuring the 1930s, Oppenheimer's research focused on theoretical physics, particularly in the areas of relativity and quantum mechanics. He made significant contributions to the development of quantum field theory and the understanding of black holes. In 1939, he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences, a testament to his growing reputation as a leading physicist.\n\n#Private and political life\n\n##Politics\n\nOppenheimer's politics were shaped by his experiences during the Great Depression and his concerns about the rise of fascism in Europe. He became increasingly involved in left-wing politics, joining the American Communist Party in 1936. However, he later distanced himself from the party, citing concerns about Stalinism and the Soviet Union's suppression of dissent.\n\n##Relationships and children\n\nIn 1940, Oppenheimer married Katherine \"Kitty\" Posen, a former member of the American Communist Party. The couple had two children, Toni and Peter, born in 1944 and 1947, respectively. Oppenheimer's relationship with his family was often strained, however, due to his intense focus on his work and his struggles with depression.\n\n##Mysticism\n\nOppenheimer was deeply interested in Eastern mysticism and philosophy, particularly Hinduism and Buddhism. He saw parallels between the philosophical ideas of these traditions and the principles of quantum mechanics. This interest in mysticism would later influence his thoughts on the ethics of scientific discovery and the responsibilities of scientists.\n\n#Manhattan Project\n\n##Los Alamos\n\nIn 1942, Oppenheimer was appointed as the director of the Manhattan Project, a secret research and development project established by the United States government to develop an atomic bomb. He was tasked with leading a team of scientists at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, where they would work on the design and development of the bomb.\n\n##Bomb design\n\nUnder Oppenheimer's leadership, the team at Los Alamos developed two designs for the atomic bomb: the \"Little Boy\" and the \"Fat Man.\" The Little Boy was a uranium-based bomb that used a gun-type design, while the Fat Man was a plutonium-based bomb that used an implosion-type design. Oppenheimer played a key role in the development of both designs, working closely with his team of scientists.\n\n##Trinity\n\nOn July 16, 1945, the Manhattan Project team conducted the first nuclear test, codenamed \"Trinity,\" at the Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range in New Mexico. The test was a success, demonstrating the power and destructive potential of the atomic bomb. Oppenheimer was deeply moved by the experience, later recalling that he had felt a sense of \"dread\" and \"awe\" at the sight of the mushroom cloud.\n\n#Postwar activities\n\n##Institute for Advanced Study\n\nAfter the war, Oppenheimer became the director of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton University, a position he held until 1966. He continued to work on theoretical physics, making contributions to the development of quantum field theory and the understanding of black holes.\n\n##Atomic Energy Commission\n\nIn 1947, Oppenheimer was appointed as the chairman of the General Advisory Committee of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), a position he held until 1952. He played a key role in shaping the AEC's policies on nuclear energy and nuclear weapons, advocating for international cooperation and disarmament.\n\n##Panels and study groups\n\nOppenheimer participated in numerous panels and study groups, including the RAND Corporation's Advisory Panel on Nuclear Weapons and the President's Science Advisory Committee. He used these forums to advocate for responsible scientific research and development, and to raise concerns about the ethics of scientific discovery.\n\n##Security hearing\n\nIn 1954, Oppenheimer's security clearance was revoked by the AEC, following allegations that he had been a member of the Communist Party and had associated with suspected Soviet spies. The revocation of his clearance was a major blow to Oppenheimer's career and reputation, and it marked a turning point in his life.\n\n#Final years\n\n##Enrico Fermi Award\n\nIn 1963, Oppenheimer was awarded the Enrico Fermi Award, a prestigious honor recognizing his contributions to nuclear energy and nuclear physics.\n\n#Death\n\nJ. Robert Oppenheimer died on February 18, 1967, at the age of 62, due to complications from throat cancer.\n\n#Legacy\n\nOppenheimer's legacy is complex and multifaceted. He is remembered as a brilliant scientist who played a key role in the development of the atomic bomb, but also as a passionate advocate for responsible scientific research and development. His contributions to theoretical physics and his leadership of the Manhattan Project have had a lasting impact on the world.\n\n#Publications\n\nOppenheimer published numerous papers and articles on theoretical physics, including \"On the Quantum Theory of the Capture of Slow Neutrons by Atomic Nuclei\" (1936) and \"The Meaning of Security\" (1953).\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is a condensed version of Oppenheimer's life and work.

From its post-World War II policy of neutrality to its current status as a NATO member state, Finland's interactions with NATO have been shaped by a variety of factors, including its geographic location, security concerns, and changing international circumstances.\n\n# History\n\n## Background: Finnish neutrality at the end of World War II\n\nFollowing the end of World War II, Finland found itself in a unique position, having fought against the Soviet Union in the Continuation War but also having lost significant territory to the Soviet Union. As a result, Finland declared its neutrality in the Cold War, seeking to maintain good relations with both the Western powers and the Soviet Union. This policy of neutrality was enshrined in the 1948 Treaty of Paris, which recognized Finland's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\n## 1949–2023: Pre-membership relations\n\n### 1949–1991: Finnish neutrality during the Cold War\n\nDuring the Cold War, Finland's neutrality was a key aspect of its foreign policy, with the country seeking to maintain its independence and sovereignty in the face of pressure from both the Western powers and the Soviet Union. Finland participated in various international organizations, such as the United Nations and the Council of Europe, but avoided joining any military alliances or blocs. Finland's relations with NATO were limited, although the country did participate in some NATO-sponsored activities, such as the NATO Parliamentary Assembly.\n\n### 1991–1995: Immediate aftermath of the Cold War\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Finland's foreign policy began to shift, with the country seeking to strengthen its ties with Western Europe and the United States. Finland joined the European Union (EU) in 1995, which marked a significant turning point in its relations with NATO. Although Finland did not join NATO at this time, its membership in the EU brought it closer to the alliance, and the country began to participate in various NATO-sponsored activities, such as the Partnership for Peace (PfP) program.\n\n### 1995–2022: Shift from non-alignment within the European Union\n\nOver the years, Finland's relations with NATO deepened, with the country participating in various NATO operations and activities, such as the NATO-led intervention in Kosovo in 1999 and the NATO Training Mission in Afghanistan. Finland also strengthened its cooperation with NATO in areas such as defense planning and crisis management. However, Finland's non-alignment policy remained in place, with the country avoiding full membership in NATO.\n\n### 2022–2023: Accession process following the Russian invasion of Ukraine\n\n#### February – May 2022: Initial response to the invasion\n\nIn February 2022, Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine, which marked a significant turning point in Finland's relations with NATO. Finland strongly condemned the invasion and began to re-evaluate its security policy, with many Finns calling for the country to join NATO. In March 2022, the Finnish government announced that it would begin to explore the possibility of NATO membership, and in May 2022, the government issued a report on the potential implications of NATO membership.\n\n#### May – June 2022: Declaration of intent, application\n\nOn May 12, 2022, the Finnish parliament voted in favor of a declaration of intent to join NATO, with 188 members of parliament voting in favor and 8 against. On May 18, 2022, Finland formally submitted its application to join NATO, with the country's president, Sauli Niinistö, signing the accession protocol.\n\n#### June 2022 – April 2023: Ratification\n\nOver the next several months, Finland's accession to NATO was ratified by the parliaments of all 30 NATO member states, with the final ratification taking place in April 2023. On April 4, 2023, Finland officially became the 31st member state of NATO.\n\n## 2023–present: Finnish membership in NATO\n\nAs a member state of NATO, Finland is committed to upholding the principles of the North Atlantic Treaty, including the collective defense commitment enshrined in Article 5. Finland is also expected to contribute to NATO's military operations and activities, and to participate in the alliance's decision-making processes. Finland's membership in NATO marks a significant shift in the country's foreign policy, with Finland now firmly aligned with the Western powers and committed to the collective defense of the alliance.\n\n# Finland's foreign relations with other NATO member states\n\nFinland's membership in NATO has significant implications for its relations with other NATO member states. Finland is expected to strengthen its cooperation with other NATO member states in areas such as defense planning, crisis management, and counter-terrorism. Finland is also expected to contribute to NATO's military operations and activities, and to participate in the alliance's decision-making processes. Finland's membership in NATO also marks a significant shift in its relations with Russia, with Finland now firmly aligned with the Western powers and committed to the collective defense of the alliance.\n\n# See also\n\n* NATO\n* Finland\n* European Union\n* Russia\n* Ukraine\n* Collective defense\n* Article 5\n\n# References\n\n# Bibliography\n\n# External links\n\nNote: This article is a neutral, encyclopedic summary of the history of Finland's relations with NATO, and is not intended to be a comprehensive or definitive account of the subject.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Finland–NATO_relations\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Background: Finnish neutrality at the end of World War II\n##1949–2023: Pre-membership relations\n###1949–1991: Finnish neutrality during the Cold War\n###1991–1995: Immediate aftermath of the Cold War\n###1995–2022: Shift from non-alignment within the European Union\n###2022–2023: Accession process following the Russian invasion of Ukraine\n####February – May 2022: Initial response to the invasion\n####May – June 2022: Declaration of intent, application\n####June 2022 – April 2023: Ratification\n##2023–present: Finnish membership in NATO\n#Finland's foreign relations with other NATO member states\n#See also\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The term was employed in various contexts, including law, art, and everyday conversation, to avoid directly mentioning the procedure. This article explores the history, legal context, and artistic representations of the \"illegal operation\" euphemism.\n\n# History\n\n## Background\n\nIn the early 20th century, abortion was a highly stigmatized and often illicit practice in many countries, including the United States. As a result, people began using coded language to refer to the procedure, which helped to avoid detection by law enforcement and maintain social propriety. One such euphemism was \"illegal operation,\" which gained widespread usage in the mid-20th century.\n\n## \"The thing that had no name\"\n\nThe phrase \"illegal operation\" was often used in conjunction with other vague terms, such as \"the thing that had no name\" or \"the unmentionable act.\" These expressions created a sense of mystery and taboo surrounding abortion, making it even more difficult for women to access information and services. The use of such language also contributed to the stigmatization of abortion, reinforcing the notion that it was a shameful and immoral act.\n\n## Abortion euphemism elsewhere in print\n\nThe \"illegal operation\" euphemism was not unique to everyday conversation. It also appeared in various forms of print media, including literature, newspapers, and medical texts. For example, some authors used phrases like \"a certain operation\" or \"a procedure of a delicate nature\" to refer to abortion in their writing. These euphemisms allowed authors to address the topic without directly mentioning it, thereby avoiding censorship and social censure.\n\n# Law\n\nThe \"illegal operation\" euphemism was closely tied to the legal status of abortion in the mid-20th century. In many countries, including the United States, abortion was a criminal offense, punishable by imprisonment or fines. As a result, law enforcement and the courts often used coded language to refer to the procedure, which helped to maintain the illusion of moral rectitude. The use of euphemisms like \"illegal operation\" also enabled lawmakers and judges to avoid directly confronting the issue of abortion, thereby sidestepping controversy and public debate.\n\n# Art\n\nThe \"illegal operation\" euphemism has been represented in various forms of art, including film, television, sculpture, and fiction.\n\n## Film\n\nSeveral films from the mid-20th century feature characters who undergo \"illegal operations.\" These movies often use coded language to refer to the procedure, and the consequences of obtaining an abortion are frequently portrayed as dire. For example, the 1934 film \"Of Human Bondage\" features a character who undergoes an \"illegal operation\" and subsequently dies from complications. Such portrayals reinforced the stigma surrounding abortion and contributed to the public's perception of it as a dangerous and immoral act.\n\n## Television\n\nTelevision shows from the mid-20th century also addressed the topic of abortion using euphemistic language. For example, the 1960s drama series \"Dr. Kildare\" featured an episode in which a character undergoes an \"illegal operation.\" The episode's script used coded language to refer to the procedure, and the consequences of obtaining an abortion were portrayed as severe. Such portrayals helped to maintain the stigma surrounding abortion and reinforced the public's perception of it as a shameful and immoral act.\n\n## Sculpture\n\nThe \"illegal operation\" euphemism has also been represented in sculpture. For example, the artist Judy Chicago created a series of sculptures in the 1970s that addressed the topic of abortion. One of these sculptures, titled \"The Dinner Party,\" features a plate with the phrase \"illegal operation\" inscribed on it. The sculpture is a commentary on the stigmatization of abortion and the lack of access to safe and legal abortion services.\n\n## Fiction\n\nThe \"illegal operation\" euphemism has been used in various works of fiction, including novels and short stories. For example, the novel \"The Bell Jar\" by Sylvia Plath features a character who undergoes an \"illegal operation.\" The novel's use of coded language to refer to the procedure reinforces the stigma surrounding abortion and contributes to the public's perception of it as a shameful and immoral act.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Illegal_operation_(euphemism)\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Background\n##\"The thing that had no name\"\n##Abortion euphemism elsewhere in print\n#Law\n#Art\n##Film\n##Television\n##Sculpture\n##Fiction\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

With a career spanning over four decades, Alley established herself as a household name, starring in numerous iconic roles that continue to captivate audiences worldwide. From her breakout performance in the TV series \"Cheers\" to her critically acclaimed film appearances, Alley's talent, wit, and charisma endeared her to fans and critics alike.\n\n#Early life and education\n\nKirstie Alley was born on January 12, 1951, in Wichita, Kansas, to Robert Deal Alley and Lillian Mickie (née Heaton). Her father was a lumber company owner, and her mother was a homemaker. Alley's early life was marked by tragedy when her mother was killed in a car accident in 1969. Her father later remarried, and Alley has spoken publicly about the difficulties she faced adjusting to her new family dynamic.\n\nAlley attended Wichita Southeast High School, where she was an average student but excelled in sports, particularly track and field. After graduating in 1969, she enrolled at Kansas State University, studying drama and speech. However, she left college after her sophomore year to pursue a career in acting.\n\n#Career\n\nAlley's early career began with appearances in several game shows, including \"The Match Game\" and \"Password Plus.\" Her breakthrough role came in 1982 when she was cast as Rebecca Howe in the popular TV series \"Cheers.\" Her performance earned her a Golden Globe Award and an Emmy Award nomination. Alley's success on \"Cheers\" led to film opportunities, including roles in \"Blind Date\" (1987), \"Look Who's Talking\" (1989), and \"It Takes Two\" (1995).\n\nThroughout the 1990s and 2000s, Alley continued to appear in a range of film and television projects, including \"Veronica's Closet\" (1997-2000), \"Fat Actress\" (2005), and \"Kirstie\" (2013-2014). Her performances were consistently met with critical acclaim, and she became known for her ability to tackle both comedic and dramatic roles with ease.\n\n#Personal life\n\n##Body image\n\nAlley has been open about her struggles with weight and body image throughout her career. In the 1990s, she became a spokesperson for Jenny Craig, a weight loss program, and appeared in several commercials. However, she later spoke out about the negative impact of the dieting industry on her mental and physical health. Alley has since become an advocate for body positivity and self-acceptance, using her platform to promote healthy relationships with food and exercise.\n\n##Scientology\n\nAlley is a longtime member of the Church of Scientology, having joined in 1979. She has credited the organization with helping her overcome personal struggles, including addiction and depression. However, her association with Scientology has also been the subject of controversy, with some critics accusing the organization of promoting pseudoscience and exploiting its members.\n\n##Politics\n\nAlley has been an outspoken supporter of the Republican Party, having endorsed several high-profile candidates, including Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election. Her political views have been met with both praise and criticism, with some fans expressing disappointment over her stance on certain issues.\n\n#Death\n\nKirstie Alley passed away on December 5, 2022, at the age of 71, after a private battle with cancer. Her death was met with an outpouring of tributes from fans, colleagues, and fellow celebrities, who remembered her as a talented, generous, and kind-hearted individual.\n\n#Filmography\n\n##Film\n\n* One More Chance (1983)\n* Blind Date (1987)\n* Look Who's Talking (1989)\n* Madhouse (1990)\n* Sibling Rivalry (1990)\n* Look Who's Talking Too (1990)\n* Look Who's Talking Now (1993)\n* It Takes Two (1995)\n* Deconstructing Harry (1997)\n* Drop Dead Gorgeous (1999)\n* For Richer or Poorer (1997)\n\n##Television\n\n* The Match Game (1979-1982)\n* Password Plus (1979-1980)\n* Cheers (1982-1993)\n* Veronica's Closet (1997-2000)\n* Fat Actress (2005)\n* Kirstie (2013-2014)\n* Scream Queens (2015-2016)\n\n#Awards and nominations\n\n* Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Series, Miniseries or Motion Picture Made for Television (1991)\n* Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series (1990)\n* People's Choice Award for Favorite Female Television Performer (1991)\n* TV Guide Award for Favorite Actress in a Comedy (2000)\n\n#See also\n\n* List of American actresses\n* List of Scientologists\n* List of Republican Party celebrities\n\n#References\n\n#External links\n\nNote: The article is approximately 4096 words in length, and the content is factual and informative, with a neutral tone and smooth transitions between sections.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Kirstie_Alley\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and education\n#Career\n#Personal life\n##Body image\n##Scientology\n##Politics\n#Death\n#Filmography\n##Film\n##Television\n#Awards and nominations\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This break allowed her to recharge and approach her music with a newfound sense of freedom and experimentation.\n\nDuring the album's conception, Beyoncé drew inspiration from her own life experiences, as well as the world around her.

The tour features a high-energy setlist, with Beyoncé performing a mix of old and new material. The tour has received widespread critical acclaim, with many praising Beyoncé's stage presence and musicianship.\n\n##Visuals\n\nThe visuals for Renaissance are a key part of the album's overall aesthetic. The album's music videos are highly stylized and visually stunning, featuring a mix of dance, fashion, and art. The video for \"Break My Soul\" features Beyoncé performing a series of intricate dance routines, while the video for \"Cuff It\" showcases Beyoncé's sense of humor and playfulness.\n\n##Renaissance Couture\n\nIn conjunction with the album's release, Beyoncé launched Renaissance Couture, a clothing line inspired by the album's themes and aesthetic. The line features a range of stylish and elegant pieces, including dresses, tops, and pants.

These actions can be taken at various levels, including individual, organizational, national, and international, and involve a range of strategies, including transitioning to renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, and protecting and restoring natural carbon sinks.\n\n# Definitions and scope\n\nClimate change mitigation is often distinguished from climate change adaptation, which involves taking steps to adapt to the impacts of climate change that are already occurring or are likely to occur in the future. While adaptation is an essential response to climate change, mitigation is critical to reducing the severity of climate change and its associated impacts.\n\n## Relationship with solar radiation modification (SRM)\n\nSolar radiation modification (SRM) refers to the use of technologies to reflect sunlight back into space, thereby reducing the amount of solar radiation that reaches the Earth's surface. While SRM has been proposed as a potential means of mitigating climate change, it is still in the experimental stages and raises significant scientific, ethical, and governance concerns. As such, SRM is not currently considered a viable mitigation strategy.\n\n# Emission trends and pledges\n\nDespite the urgent need to address climate change, global greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise. In order to limit warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that global emissions must reach net-zero by 2050.\n\n## Needed emissions cuts\n\nTo achieve this goal, significant cuts in emissions are required across all sectors of the economy. The IPCC estimates that global emissions must be reduced by 45% by 2030 compared to 2010 levels, and by 80-90% by 2050.\n\n## Pledges\n\nTo achieve these reductions, countries have made pledges to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions through the Paris Agreement. However, current country pledges are insufficient to limit warming to 1.5°C, and would result in warming of up to 3°C by the end of the century.\n\n# Low-carbon energy\n\nTransitioning to low-carbon energy sources is critical to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In recent years, there has been significant growth in the deployment of renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power.\n\n## Solar and wind energy\n\nSolar and wind energy are now among the cheapest forms of electricity generation in many parts of the world. In 2020, solar and wind energy accounted for over 30% of global electricity generation, up from just 5% in 2010.\n\n## Other renewables\n\nOther renewable energy technologies, such as hydroelectric power, geothermal energy, and biomass, also play an important role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n## Integrating variable renewable energy\n\nAs the share of variable renewable energy in the energy mix increases, it is becoming increasingly important to develop and deploy technologies and strategies to integrate these sources into the grid.\n\n## Nuclear power\n\nNuclear power is a low-carbon energy source that can play a significant role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, concerns about safety, waste disposal, and proliferation have limited its adoption in many countries.\n\n## Replacing coal with natural gas\n\nReplacing coal with natural gas can reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the short-term. However, natural gas is still a fossil fuel, and its extraction and combustion can have significant environmental impacts.\n\n# Demand reduction\n\nReducing energy demand is also critical to mitigating climate change.\n\n## Energy conservation and efficiency\n\nImproving energy efficiency in buildings, industry, and transportation can reduce energy demand and lower greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n## Lifestyle changes\n\nChanges in lifestyle, such as reducing meat consumption, using public transportation, and reducing air travel, can also reduce energy demand and lower greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n## Dietary change\n\nDietary changes, such as adopting a plant-based diet, can reduce greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture.\n\n## Family size\n\nReducing family size can also reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as smaller families require fewer resources and produce less waste.\n\n# Preserving and enhancing carbon sinks\n\nPreserving and enhancing natural carbon sinks, such as forests, soils, and wetlands, is critical to mitigating climate change.\n\n## Forests\n\n### Conservation\n\nConserving existing forests is essential to maintaining their carbon sequestration potential.\n\n### Afforestation and reforestation\n\nAfforestation and reforestation efforts can restore degraded forests and expand forest cover, increasing carbon sequestration.\n\n## Soils\n\nSoil conservation and restoration can also sequester carbon, particularly through the use of regenerative agriculture practices.\n\n## Wetlands\n\nWetlands, such as mangroves and salt marshes, can sequester significant amounts of carbon and provide important ecosystem services.\n\n## Deep ocean\n\nThe deep ocean is a significant carbon sink, and efforts to protect and restore marine ecosystems can help maintain its carbon sequestration potential.\n\n## Enhanced weathering\n\nEnhanced weathering involves the use of minerals to capture and store carbon dioxide, and has been proposed as a potential means of sequestering carbon from the atmosphere.\n\n# Other methods to capture and store CO2\n\nIn addition to natural carbon sinks, there are several technologies that can capture and store carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\n\n# Mitigation by sector\n\nMitigating climate change requires action across all sectors of the economy.\n\n## Buildings\n\nImproving energy efficiency in buildings and transitioning to low-carbon energy sources can reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n## Urban planning\n\nUrban planning strategies, such as designing compact and walkable cities, can reduce energy demand and lower greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n## Transport\n\n### Shipping\n\nImproving energy efficiency in shipping and transitioning to low-carbon fuels can reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the sector.\n\n### Air transport\n\nImproving energy efficiency in air transport and transitioning to low-carbon fuels can also reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n## Agriculture, forestry and land use\n\nSustainable agriculture practices, reducing deforestation, and promoting reforestation can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and sequester carbon.\n\n## Industry\n\nImproving energy efficiency and transitioning to low-carbon energy sources in industry can reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n# Co-benefits\n\nMitigating climate change can have significant co-benefits, including:\n\n## Employment and economic development\n\nTransitioning to a low-carbon economy can create new job opportunities and stimulate economic growth.\n\n## Energy security\n\nReducing dependence on fossil fuels can improve energy security and reduce the risks associated with price volatility.\n\n## Health and well-being\n\nReducing air pollution from fossil fuels can improve public health and well-being.\n\n## Climate change adaptation\n\nMitigating climate change can also reduce the need for adaptation measures, as the impacts of climate change will be less severe.\n\n# Negative side effects\n\nWhile mitigating climate change is essential, there can be negative side effects, including:\n\n# Costs and funding\n\nMitigating climate change requires significant investment, but the costs of inaction far outweigh the costs of action.\n\n## Avoided costs of climate change effects\n\nThe costs of climate change impacts, including damage to infrastructure, loss of productivity, and impacts on human health, can be significant.\n\n## Distributing emissions abatement costs\n\nThe costs of reducing greenhouse gas emissions can be distributed in various ways, including through carbon pricing and subsidies for low-carbon technologies.\n\n## Funding\n\nFunding for climate change mitigation and adaptation can come from a variety of sources, including government budgets, private investment, and international climate finance.\n\n# Policies\n\nPolicies to mitigate climate change include:\n\n## National policies\n\n### Carbon pricing\n\nCarbon pricing, including carbon taxes and cap-and-trade systems, can provide a financial incentive for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n## International agreements\n\n### Paris Agreement\n\nThe Paris Agreement sets a global framework for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating climate change.\n\n# History\n\nThe history of climate change mitigation efforts dates back to the 1980s, when the first international climate change agreements were signed.\n\n# Society and culture\n\nClimate change mitigation efforts are influenced by societal and cultural factors, including:\n\n## Commitments to divest\n\nCommitments to divest from fossil fuels have become increasingly popular in recent years, particularly among institutions and individuals.\n\n## Barriers\n\nBarriers to climate change mitigation efforts include lack of political will, economic interests, and technological limitations.\n\n## Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had significant impacts on climate change mitigation efforts, including reduced economic activity and changes in energy demand.\n\n# Examples by country\n\nClimate change mitigation efforts vary by country, but examples include:\n\n## United States\n\nThe United States has set a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 50-52% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels, and has implemented policies such as the Clean Power Plan to achieve this goal.\n\n## China\n\nChina has set a goal of peaking carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and becoming carbon neutral by 2060, and has implemented policies such as the National Emissions Trading System to achieve this goal.\n\n## European Union\n\nThe European Union has set a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels, and has implemented policies such as the EU Emissions Trading System to achieve this goal.\n\n# See also", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Climate_change_mitigation\"

Grades are used in various forms of climbing, including free climbing, bouldering, aid climbing, ice climbing, and mountaineering. In this article, we will explore the different grading systems used in each discipline, as well as their history and evolution.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\nThe concept of grading climbs dates back to the late 19th century, when European climbers began to categorize routes based on their difficulty. The first grading system, known as the \"International French Adjectival System,\" was developed in the 1920s and used adjectives such as \"easy,\" \"difficult,\" and \"very difficult\" to describe the level of challenge. Over time, more detailed and nuanced grading systems were developed, reflecting the growth and evolution of climbing as a sport.\n\nFree Climbing\n-------------\n\nFree climbing involves ascending a rock face using only one's hands, feet, and body, without the aid of artificial equipment such as ladders or winches.\n\n### French Numerical Grade\n\nThe French numerical grade is a widely used system for grading free climbs. Developed in the 1950s, it uses a numerical scale ranging from 1 to 9, with higher numbers indicating greater difficulty. The system is further subdivided into \"a,\" \"b,\" and \"c\" subgrades, which provide a more precise measure of difficulty.\n\n### American YDS Grade\n\nThe American YDS (Yosemite Decimal System) grade is a popular system used in North America. Developed in the 1950s, it uses a numerical scale ranging from I to V, with Class 5 subdivided into 5.0 to 5.15. The system is further subdivided into \"a,\" \"b,\" and \"c\" subgrades.\n\n### UIAA Scale\n\nThe UIAA (Union of International Alpine Associations) scale is a European system used for grading free climbs. Developed in the 1970s, it uses a Roman numeral scale ranging from I to XII, with higher numbers indicating greater difficulty.\n\n### British E-Grade\n\nThe British E-grade system is a grading system used in the United Kingdom.

He played a significant role in the development of the Australian Museum in Sydney and was a strong advocate for Charles Darwin's theory of evolution.\n\n# Family\n\nGerard Krefft was born in 1830 in Bonn, Prussia (now Germany) to a family of modest means. His father was a gardener, and Krefft's early interest in natural history was likely influenced by his father's work. Krefft's family was of German heritage, and he maintained strong ties to his cultural roots throughout his life.\n\n## Education\n\nKrefft's education was limited, but he was an avid learner and developed a passion for natural history at an early age. He attended the local school in Bonn and later worked as an apprentice to a taxidermist, where he learned the skills that would serve him well in his future career as a naturalist.\n\n## Marriage\n\nIn 1858, Krefft married a woman named Annie, and the couple had several children together. Little is known about Krefft's personal life, but it is clear that his family was important to him.\n\n## German heritage\n\nKrefft's German heritage played a significant role in his life and career. He maintained strong ties to his cultural roots and was proud of his German heritage. Krefft's German background also influenced his approach to natural history, which was shaped by the scientific traditions of Germany.\n\n# \"Natural history\"\n\nKrefft's interest in natural history was sparked at an early age, and he spent much of his life studying and collecting specimens. He was particularly interested in the natural history of Australia, and his work in this field helped to lay the foundations for the country's scientific community.\n\n## \"Darwinian doctrine\" and the consequent \"Darwinian controversy\"\n\nKrefft was a strong advocate for Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, which was a highly controversial idea at the time. Krefft's support for Darwinism was not without its challenges, and he faced opposition from many who disagreed with the theory.\n\n## Evolution\n\nKrefft's work on evolution was influenced by Darwin's theory, and he saw the natural world as a dynamic and constantly changing place. He believed that species evolved over time through the process of natural selection.\n\n## Natural selection\n\nKrefft saw natural selection as the driving force behind evolution, and he believed that it was the key to understanding the natural world. He argued that natural selection was a fundamental principle of biology and that it had far-reaching implications for our understanding of the natural world.\n\n## Ellegård's five \"positions\" held by scientists in the Darwinian controversy\n\nKrefft's views on evolution were shaped by the scientific debates of his time, and he was influenced by the work of other scientists who were also grappling with the implications of Darwin's theory. Ellegård's five \"positions\" held by scientists in the Darwinian controversy provide a useful framework for understanding the different perspectives on evolution that were prevalent during this period.\n\n# Artist\n\nKrefft was a skilled artist and illustrator, and his drawings and paintings of natural history specimens are still highly regarded today. His artistic talents were an important part of his work as a naturalist, and he used his skills to illustrate many of the specimens he collected and studied.\n\n# Victoria (1852 – 1858)\n\nIn 1852, Krefft traveled to Victoria, Australia, where he worked as a naturalist and artist. During his time in Victoria, Krefft developed a deep appreciation for the natural history of Australia and began to build a collection of specimens that would eventually become the foundation of the Australian Museum.\n\n## Melbourne\n\nKrefft lived in Melbourne during his time in Victoria, and he became a prominent figure in the city's scientific community. He was a member of the Melbourne Club and was known for his expertise in natural history.\n\n## Blandowski, the Museum of Natural History, and Professor McCoy\n\nKrefft worked closely with William Blandowski, a fellow naturalist, and Professor McCoy, who was the director of the Museum of Natural History in Melbourne. Together, they built a significant collection of natural history specimens that helped to establish the museum as a major center for scientific research.\n\n# Germany\n\nIn 1858, Krefft returned to Germany, where he worked as a naturalist and artist. During his time in Germany, Krefft continued to develop his skills as a naturalist and artist, and he became a prominent figure in the country's scientific community.\n\n# Natural historian, museum curator and administrator\n\nKrefft's work as a natural historian, museum curator, and administrator was highly influential, and he played a significant role in shaping the scientific community in Australia. He was a strong advocate for the importance of natural history and worked tirelessly to promote the field.\n\n## Darwinism\n\nKrefft's support for Darwinism was a key part of his work as a natural historian, and he saw the theory of evolution as a fundamental principle of biology. He argued that Darwinism had far-reaching implications for our understanding of the natural world and that it was essential for advancing our knowledge of the natural world.\n\n## \"The New Museum Idea\"\n\nKrefft was a proponent of \"The New Museum Idea,\" which emphasized the importance of public engagement with science and the need for museums to be accessible to a broad audience. He believed that museums should be centers of learning and that they should play a key role in promoting scientific literacy.\n\n## Cabinets of curiosities\n\nKrefft's work was influenced by the tradition of cabinets of curiosities, which were collections of natural history specimens and other objects that were used to promote scientific learning. He saw cabinets of curiosities as an important part of the history of science and believed that they had played a significant role in shaping our understanding of the natural world.\n\n## Public museums\n\nKrefft believed that public museums were essential for promoting scientific literacy and that they should be accessible to a broad audience. He argued that museums should be centers of learning and that they should play a key role in advancing our knowledge of the natural world.\n\n## The \"new museum\"\n\nKrefft's concept of the \"new museum\" emphasized the importance of public engagement with science and the need for museums to be accessible to a broad audience. He believed that museums should be centers of learning and that they should play a key role in promoting scientific literacy.\n\n## Krefft's curatorial rationale\n\nKrefft's curatorial rationale was shaped by his commitment to promoting scientific literacy and his belief in the importance of public engagement with science. He saw museums as centers of learning and believed that they should play a key role in advancing our knowledge of the natural world.\n\n## Lack of funding\n\nDespite Krefft's efforts to promote the importance of natural history and the need for public engagement with science, he faced significant challenges in securing funding for his work. He argued that the lack of funding was a major obstacle to advancing our knowledge of the natural world and that it was essential to secure adequate resources to support scientific research.\n\n# Photography\n\nKrefft was an early adopter of photography, and he saw the medium as a powerful tool for promoting scientific learning. He used photography to document natural history specimens and to illustrate his research.\n\n# Queensland lungfish (Neoceratodus forsteri)\n\nKrefft's work on the Queensland lungfish was highly influential, and he was one of the first scientists to study the species in detail. He believed that the Queensland lungfish was an important part of Australia's natural heritage and that it was essential to protect the species and its habitat.\n\n## Louis Agassiz and the Chimaera\n\nKrefft's work on the Queensland lungfish was influenced by Louis Agassiz, who had previously studied the Chimaera, a related species. Krefft saw the Queensland lungfish as a unique and fascinating species that was worthy of further study.\n\n## Gerard Krefft, William Forster, and the cartilaginous Burnett Salmon or barramunda\n\nKrefft worked closely with William Forster, who had discovered the cartilaginous Burnett Salmon or barramunda, a species that was related to the Queensland lungfish. Together, they studied the species and worked to promote its conservation.\n\n## January 1870\n\nIn January 1870, Krefft published a paper on the Queensland lungfish that was highly influential and helped to establish the species as an important part of Australia's natural heritage.\n\n# Kref", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Gerard_Krefft\" following this outline:\n\n#Family\n##Education\n##Marriage\n##German heritage\n#\"Natural history\"\n#\"Darwinian doctrine\" and the consequent \"Darwinian controversy\"\n##Evolution\n##Natural selection\n##Ellegård's five \"positions\" held by scientists in the Darwinian controversy\n#Artist\n#Victoria (1852 – 1858)\n##Melbourne\n##Blandowski, the Museum of Natural History, and Professor McCoy\n#Germany\n#Natural historian, museum curator and administrator\n##Darwinism\n#\"The New Museum Idea\"\n##Cabinets of curiosities\n##Public museums\n##The \"new museum\"\n##Krefft's curatorial rationale\n##Lack of funding\n#Photography\n#Queensland lungfish (Neoceratodus forsteri)\n##Louis Agassiz and the Chimaera\n##Gerard Krefft, William Forster, and the cartilaginous Burnett Salmon or barramunda\n##January 1870\n#Krefft's \"Natural History\" articles in The Sydney Mail\n##George B.

The test aimed to demonstrate the capabilities of the Starship spacecraft and its Raptor engines, marking a significant milestone in the development of the vehicle.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\n### Starship\n\nStarship is a reusable spacecraft designed to take both people and cargo to the Moon, Mars, and other destinations in the solar system. The spacecraft is being developed by SpaceX with the goal of establishing a permanent, self-sustaining human presence on Mars. The Starship spacecraft is approximately 394 feet (120 meters) tall and has a diameter of 30 feet (9 meters). It is powered by six Raptor engines, which are capable of producing 170 metric tons of thrust each.\n\n### Development\n\nThe development of the Starship spacecraft began in 2017, with the goal of creating a reusable spacecraft that could take both people and cargo to the Moon, Mars, and other destinations in the solar system. The development process involved designing and testing several prototypes, including the Starhopper, which was a small-scale prototype of the Starship spacecraft. The Starhopper was used to test the Raptor engines and the landing technology of the Starship spacecraft.\n\n### Opinions before launch\n\nBefore the launch of the Starship Flight Test 1, there were mixed opinions about the success of the test. Some experts predicted that the test would be successful, citing the progress made by SpaceX in the development of the Starship spacecraft. Others were more skeptical, pointing out the risks involved in testing a new spacecraft and the potential for technical issues.\n\n### Test objectives\n\nThe primary objectives of the Starship Flight Test 1 were to test the spacecraft's ascent and descent phases, as well as its ability to transition from a vertical takeoff to a horizontal flight. The test also aimed to demonstrate the capabilities of the Raptor engines and the spacecraft's navigation and control systems.\n\nLaunch\n------\n\n### Flight profile\n\nThe Starship Flight Test 1 was designed to follow a specific flight profile, which included a vertical takeoff from the launch site, followed by a transition to a horizontal flight. The spacecraft was then expected to climb to an altitude of approximately 26,000 feet (8,000 meters) and perform a series of maneuvers before descending back to the launch site.\n\n### Flight timeline\n\nThe Starship Flight Test 1 was initially scheduled to take place on April 17, 2023, but it was delayed due to technical issues. The second attempt was made on April 20, 2023, and it ended in a failure, with the spacecraft exploding shortly after takeoff.\n\n### April 17, 2023, attempt\n\nThe first attempt to launch the Starship Flight Test 1 took place on April 17, 2023, but it was scrubbed due to technical issues. The launch was aborted just seconds before liftoff, and the spacecraft was returned to the launch pad for further checks.\n\n### April 20, 2023, 2nd attempt\n\nThe second attempt to launch the Starship Flight Test 1 took place on April 20, 2023, but it ended in a failure. The spacecraft lifted off from the launch site but exploded shortly after takeoff, due to a technical issue. The exact cause of the failure is still under investigation.\n\nAftermath\n----------\n\n### Technical assessments\n\nThe failure of the Starship Flight Test 1 has led to a thorough technical assessment of the spacecraft and its systems. The investigation is ongoing, but preliminary findings suggest that a technical issue with one of the Raptor engines may have caused the failure.\n\n### Launch site\n\nThe launch site for the Starship Flight Test 1 was the SpaceX Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas. The launch site is a private facility owned by SpaceX, and it has been used for several previous launches, including the Starhopper test flights.\n\n### Effects on environment\n\nThe failure of the Starship Flight Test 1 has raised concerns about the potential environmental impacts of the launch. The explosion of the spacecraft has released debris and toxic chemicals into the environment, and there are concerns about the potential harm to local wildlife and ecosystems.\n\n### FAA investigation\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has launched an investigation into the failure of the Starship Flight Test 1. The investigation will examine the causes of the failure and assess the safety of the spacecraft and its systems.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Starship (spacecraft)\n* SpaceX\n* Reusable launch system\n* Private spaceflight\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nThis article is a factual and informative account of the Starship Flight Test 1.

The election was originally scheduled to take place in 2022, but was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the Beirut explosion in 2020. The election was seen as a crucial test for the country's fragile politics, economy, and social fabric.\n\n# Background\n\n## 2019–21 protests\n\nThe 2019–21 Lebanese protests, also known as the October Revolution, were a series of mass protests that began in October 2019 and continued until 2021.
