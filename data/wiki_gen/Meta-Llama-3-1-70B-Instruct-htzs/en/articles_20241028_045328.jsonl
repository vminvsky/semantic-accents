The crisis began in 2021, with a significant buildup of Russian troops along the Ukrainian border, and escalated into a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\n# Background\n\nThe crisis in Ukraine began in 2014, when a popular uprising led to the ousting of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, who was seen as pro-Russian. This led to a conflict between Ukrainian government forces and Russian-backed separatists in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. The conflict resulted in the deaths of over 14,000 people and the displacement of millions.\n\nIn the years following the conflict, tensions between Ukraine and Russia remained high. Russia continued to support the separatists in eastern Ukraine, and Ukraine sought to integrate more closely with Western Europe and NATO. The situation was further complicated by the presence of Russian troops in Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014.\n\n# Initial tensions (March–April 2021)\n\n## First Russian military buildup\n\nIn March 2021, Russia began a significant buildup of its military forces along the Ukrainian border. The buildup was seen as a response to Ukraine's increasing ties with NATO and the West. Russia claimed that the buildup was a response to Ukrainian aggression, but Ukraine and its Western allies saw it as an attempt to intimidate and destabilize the country.\n\nThe buildup included the deployment of thousands of Russian troops, as well as tanks, artillery, and other military equipment. The Russian military also conducted a series of exercises and drills in the region, which were seen as a show of force.\n\n## Continued violence and escalation\n\nDespite the Russian military buildup, violence continued to escalate in eastern Ukraine. Ukrainian government forces and Russian-backed separatists clashed regularly, resulting in the deaths of dozens of people. The situation was further complicated by the presence of Russian troops in the region, which Ukraine claimed were supporting the separatists.\n\n## Partial withdrawal\n\nIn April 2021, Russia announced that it would partially withdraw its troops from the Ukrainian border. However, the withdrawal was seen as incomplete, and many Russian troops remained in the region.\n\n# Renewed tensions (October 2021–February 2022)\n\n## Second Russian military buildup\n\nIn October 2021, Russia began a second military buildup along the Ukrainian border. The buildup was seen as a response to Ukraine's increasing ties with NATO and the West, as well as a desire to assert Russian influence in the region.\n\n### November 2021–December 2021\n\nThe second Russian military buildup was significant, with thousands of Russian troops deployed along the Ukrainian border. The buildup included the deployment of tanks, artillery, and other military equipment, as well as the construction of new military bases and facilities.\n\n### January 2022\n\nIn January 2022, the Russian military buildup continued, with reports of additional troops and equipment being deployed to the region. The situation was seen as increasingly tense, with many fearing a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n### February 2022\n\nIn February 2022, the situation along the Ukrainian border continued to escalate. Russian troops remained deployed in large numbers, and there were reports of clashes between Ukrainian government forces and Russian-backed separatists.\n\n## Alleged Russian subversion attempts\n\nIn the months leading up to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, there were reports of alleged Russian subversion attempts.

The club was founded in 1926 and has since become one of the most successful and beloved teams in Greece.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### Foundation and early years (1926–1939)\n\nPAOK FC was founded on April 20, 1926, by a group of Greek refugees from Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul). The club's early years were marked by struggles on and off the pitch, as the team fought to establish itself in the Greek football landscape. Despite these challenges, PAOK quickly gained a loyal following and became a staple of the Thessalonian football scene.\n\n### Greco-Italian War and World War II (1939–1945)\n\nDuring World War II, PAOK FC's activities were severely disrupted. Many of the club's players and staff were called to serve in the Greek army, and the team was forced to suspend its operations. Despite these difficult circumstances, PAOK continued to play an important role in the Thessalonian community, providing a sense of normalcy and comfort to fans during a time of great turmoil.\n\n### Macedonia Football Clubs Association (Macedonia Championship) (1946–1959)\n\nAfter the war, PAOK FC resumed its activities and quickly became a dominant force in the Macedonia Football Clubs Association (Macedonia Championship). The team won several regional titles during this period and established itself as one of the top teams in northern Greece.\n\n### Toumba Stadium and rise of Giorgos Koudas to prominence (1959–1969)\n\nIn 1959, PAOK FC moved to its new home, Toumba Stadium, which would become one of the most iconic and intimidating venues in Greek football. During this period, the team also began to rise to prominence, thanks in large part to the emergence of Giorgos Koudas, one of the greatest players in PAOK history. Koudas's debut in 1959 marked the beginning of a new era for the club, and he would go on to become a beloved figure in Thessalonian football.\n\n#### First years in Greek National League (Alpha Ethniki)\n\nPAOK FC joined the Greek National League (Alpha Ethniki) in 1959 and quickly established itself as a top-tier team. The club's first few seasons in the league were marked by struggles, but the team eventually found its footing and began to compete with the best teams in Greece.\n\n#### Giorgos Koudas debut and start of the Olympiacos–PAOK rivalry\n\nGiorgos Koudas's debut in 1959 not only marked the beginning of a new era for PAOK FC but also sparked the beginning of a fierce rivalry with Olympiacos, one of the most successful teams in Greek football. The Olympiacos–PAOK rivalry would go on to become one of the most intense and enduring in Greek football history.\n\n### 1970s\n\n#### 1975–76 Alpha Ethniki (first league title)\n\nPAOK FC won its first league title in the 1975–76 season, marking a major milestone in the club's history. The team's success was fueled by the emergence of a new generation of players, including the likes of Kostas Iosifidis and Giorgos Kostikos.\n\n### 1980s: Professionalism, league title and financial troubles\n\n#### 1984–85 Alpha Ethniki (second league title)\n\nPAOK FC won its second league title in the 1984–85 season, but the club's success was short-lived. Financial troubles and internal conflicts plagued the team throughout the decade, and PAOK was forced to navigate a series of challenges both on and off the pitch.\n\n### The Thomas Voulinos era (1989–1996)\n\nThomas Voulinos took over as chairman of PAOK FC in 1989 and oversaw a period of significant change and growth for the club. During his tenure, PAOK invested heavily in its youth academy and infrastructure, laying the groundwork for future success.\n\n### The George Batatoudis era (1996–2003)\n\nGeorge Batatoudis succeeded Thomas Voulinos as chairman in 1996 and continued to build on the progress made during the previous era. During his tenure, PAOK invested in top talent and established itself as a consistent top-four team in Greece.\n\n### The Giannis Goumenos era: troubled times (2003–2006)\n\nGiannis Goumenos took over as chairman in 2003, but his tenure was marked by significant turmoil and instability. Financial troubles and internal conflicts plagued the team, and PAOK struggled to compete with the top teams in Greece.\n\n### Theodoros Zagorakis – Zisis Vryzas management with massive fans' support (2007–2012)\n\nTheodoros Zagorakis and Zisis Vryzas took over as co-chairmen in 2007 and enjoyed significant success during their tenure. The team won several domestic and international titles, and PAOK established itself as a major force in Greek football.\n\n### The Ivan Savvidis era (2012–present)\n\nIvan Savvidis took over as chairman in 2012 and has overseen a period of significant growth and investment for the club.

The budget outlined a series of tax cuts and economic reforms aimed at stimulating economic growth in the United Kingdom.\n\n# Background\n\nThe mini-budget was announced in the wake of a cost of living crisis in the United Kingdom, triggered by rising energy prices and inflation. The Conservative government, led by Prime Minister Liz Truss, had promised to take bold action to address the crisis and restore economic growth. The budget was seen as a key part of this effort, and was heavily trailed in the media in the days leading up to its announcement.\n\n# The budget\n\n## Key points\n\nThe mini-budget included several key measures, including:\n\n* A reduction in the basic rate of income tax from 20% to 19%\n* The abolition of the 45% top rate of income tax\n* A cut in the rate of stamp duty on home purchases\n* The reversal of a planned increase in corporation tax\n* The introduction of new investment zones, offering tax breaks and other incentives to businesses\n* A package of measures aimed at increasing energy production and reducing reliance on imported fuels\n\nThe budget was notable for its focus on tax cuts, which were seen as a key part of the government's efforts to stimulate economic growth. However, the measures were also criticized for their potential impact on public finances and the distribution of wealth.\n\n# Reaction\n\n## Currency, interest rate, and debt\n\nThe budget was met with immediate market reaction, as the value of the pound sterling fell sharply against other major currencies. The interest rates on UK government bonds, known as gilts, also rose significantly, as investors became more cautious about lending to the UK government. This increased the cost of borrowing for the government and raised concerns about the sustainability of public finances.\n\n## Bond markets\n\nThe reaction in bond markets was particularly severe, with the yield on 10-year gilts rising by over 1% in the days following the budget. This was seen as a sign of market concern about the UK's fiscal policy and the potential for inflation. The Bank of England was forced to intervene in the market, buying up gilts in an effort to stabilize prices and prevent a sharp rise in interest rates.\n\n## International response\n\nThe budget was also met with skepticism from international observers, who questioned the wisdom of the government's tax cuts and the potential impact on public finances. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) issued a statement expressing concern about the budget and urging the UK government to reconsider its fiscal policy.\n\n## Business and economic\n\nThe business community was divided in its response to the budget, with some welcoming the tax cuts and others expressing concern about the potential impact on public finances. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) welcomed the measures aimed at increasing investment and growth, but urged the government to take a more balanced approach to fiscal policy.\n\n## Media\n\nThe media reaction to the budget was largely negative, with many commentators criticizing the government's tax cuts and the potential impact on public finances. The budget was seen as a gamble by the government, which was criticized for its lack of attention to detail and its failure to provide a clear plan for reducing the national debt.\n\n## Political\n\nThe budget was also met with criticism from opposition parties, who accused the government of favoring the wealthy and neglecting the needs of ordinary families. The Labour Party, in particular, was critical of the budget, arguing that it would do little to address the cost of living crisis and would instead increase inequality.\n\n## Opinion polling\n\nPublic opinion polls taken in the wake of the budget showed that the government's popularity had fallen sharply, with many voters expressing concern about the impact of the tax cuts on public finances and the distribution of wealth.\n\n# Government response\n\n## Initial responses\n\nIn the days following the budget, the government defended its policies, arguing that the tax cuts were necessary to stimulate economic growth and increase investment. The Chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, insisted that the measures were part of a long-term plan to improve the UK's economic competitiveness.\n\n## Dismissal of Chancellor\n\nHowever, on 14 October 2022, the Chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, was dismissed by Prime Minister Liz Truss, following a meeting at 10 Downing Street. The decision was seen as a response to the market turmoil and the criticism of the government's fiscal policy.\n\n## Reversal of tax cuts\n\nOn 17 October 2022, the government announced a reversal of the tax cuts, with the Chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, announcing that the measures would be scrapped in an effort to restore stability to the public finances.\n\n# Resignation of Truss as Prime Minister\n\nOn 25 October 2022, Liz Truss resigned as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, following a meeting with the Chairman of the 1922 Committee, Sir Graham Brady. The decision was seen as a response to the market turmoil and the criticism of the government's fiscal policy.\n\n# Subsequent events\n\n## Following Truss's resignation\n\nFollowing Truss's resignation, Rishi Sunak was appointed as the new Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, with Jeremy Hunt remaining as Chancellor. The new government announced a series of measures aimed at restoring stability to the public finances and addressing the cost of living crisis.\n\n## Later events\n\nIn the months following the budget, the UK economy continued to face challenges, with high inflation and rising interest rates. The government's fiscal policy remained a subject of debate, with many commentators arguing that the country needed a more balanced approach to taxation and public spending.\n\n# See also\n\n* 2022 United Kingdom government crisis\n* Economic policy of the Elizabeth Truss ministry\n* Fiscal policy of the United Kingdom", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"September_2022_United_Kingdom_mini-budget\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#The budget\n##Key points\n#Reaction\n##Currency, interest rate, and debt\n##Bond markets\n##International response\n##Business and economic\n##Media\n##Political\n##Opinion polling\n#Government response\n##Initial responses\n##Dismissal of Chancellor\n##Reversal of tax cuts\n#Resignation of Truss as Prime Minister\n#Subsequent events\n##Following Truss's resignation\n##Later events\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The airstrikes were reportedly aimed at targeting militant hideouts and training camps of the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), also known as the Pakistani Taliban, in the provinces of Khost and Kunar. The incident drew widespread condemnation from the Afghan government, as well as international organizations, and sparked protests across Afghanistan.\n\n#Background\n\nThe Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) is a militant organization based in the tribal regions of Pakistan and Afghanistan. The group has been involved in a long-standing insurgency against the Pakistani government, and has been responsible for numerous terrorist attacks in Pakistan. In recent years, the TTP has been using Afghanistan as a safe haven, with many of its leaders and fighters taking refuge in the country.\n\nIn 2021, the Pakistani government launched a series of military operations against the TTP in the tribal regions, forcing many of its fighters to flee to Afghanistan. The Pakistani government has since been pressing the Afghan government to take action against the TTP, which it claims is using Afghanistan as a base to launch attacks in Pakistan.\n\n#Casualties\n\nAccording to reports, the airstrikes resulted in significant civilian casualties, with estimates suggesting that between 40 to 50 people were killed, including women and children. Many more were injured, with some reports suggesting that the number of wounded could be as high as 100.\n\nThe Afghan government has condemned the airstrikes, saying that they resulted in the deaths of innocent civilians, including women and children. The government has also said that the airstrikes were a violation of Afghanistan's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\n#Reactions\n\n##Afghan government\n\nThe Afghan government has strongly condemned the airstrikes, with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issuing a statement saying that the incident was a \"clear violation of Afghanistan's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\" The government has also called on the Pakistani government to respect Afghanistan's borders and to refrain from carrying out such actions in the future.\n\n##Pakistani government\n\nThe Pakistani government has defended the airstrikes, saying that they were necessary to target militant hideouts and training camps in Afghanistan. The government has also said that it had informed the Afghan government of the airstrikes in advance, and that it had taken all necessary precautions to minimize civilian casualties.\n\n##Pakistani Taliban\n\nThe Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) has condemned the airstrikes, saying that they were a \"cowardly act\" by the Pakistani government. The group has also vowed to retaliate against the Pakistani government, saying that it would launch attacks on Pakistani soil.\n\n##United States government\n\nThe United States government has expressed concern over the airstrikes, with a State Department spokesperson saying that the US was \"deeply concerned\" about the incident. The spokesperson also called on both the Pakistani and Afghan governments to exercise restraint and to refrain from taking any actions that could escalate tensions.\n\n##Chinese government\n\nThe Chinese government has also expressed concern over the airstrikes, with a Foreign Ministry spokesperson saying that China was \"closely following\" the situation. The spokesperson also called on both the Pakistani and Afghan governments to resolve their differences through dialogue.\n\n##United Nations\n\nThe United Nations has condemned the airstrikes, with a spokesperson for the UN Secretary-General saying that the incident was a \"serious concern.\" The spokesperson also called on both the Pakistani and Afghan governments to respect human rights and to refrain from taking any actions that could harm civilians.\n\n#Protests\n\nThe airstrikes have sparked widespread protests across Afghanistan, with demonstrators taking to the streets to condemn the incident. The protests have been largely peaceful, but have resulted in some clashes between protesters and security forces.\n\nThe protests have been organized by various groups, including the Afghan government and opposition parties. The protesters have been demanding that the Pakistani government apologize for the airstrikes and that it take action to prevent such incidents in the future.\n\n#Compensation\n\nThe Afghan government has announced that it will provide compensation to the families of those killed in the airstrikes. The government has also said that it will provide medical treatment to those injured in the incident.\n\nThe Pakistani government has also announced that it will provide compensation to the families of those killed in the airstrikes. However, the amount of compensation has not been disclosed.\n\n#See also\n\n* Afghanistan-Pakistan relations\n* Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan\n* War in Afghanistan (2001-2021)\n* Pakistan-Afghanistan border skirmishes\n* List of drone strikes in Pakistan", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Pakistani_airstrikes_in_Afghanistan\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Casualties\n#Reactions\n##Afghan government\n##Pakistani government\n##Pakistani Taliban\n##United States government\n##Chinese government\n##United Nations\n#Protests\n#Compensation\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The outbreak was characterized by a series of intense and destructive tornadoes that caused widespread damage and loss of life. This article provides an overview of the meteorological conditions that led to the outbreak, the confirmed tornadoes, and the impacts of the event.\n\n# Meteorological Synopsis\n\nThe tornado outbreak of January 12, 2023, was the result of a complex weather pattern that developed over the southeastern United States. A strong low-pressure system was located over the southern Great Plains, with a trailing cold front stretching across the Gulf Coast states. As the system moved eastward, it interacted with a mass of warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico, creating a highly unstable atmosphere.\n\nAs the cold front approached the Southeast, a strong jet stream aloft provided lift and instability, leading to the development of thunderstorms. The storms quickly became supercells, characterized by strong updrafts and downdrafts, which ultimately produced tornadoes. The outbreak was fueled by strong wind shear, with wind speeds increasing with height, and a deepening low-pressure system that provided the necessary lift for the storms to develop and sustain themselves.\n\n# Confirmed Tornadoes\n\nA total of 21 tornadoes were confirmed during the outbreak, with the majority occurring in Alabama and Georgia. The tornadoes were rated on the Enhanced Fujita scale (EF scale), with the highest rating being EF4.\n\n## January 12 Event\n\nThe first tornado of the day touched down in Autauga County, Alabama, at approximately 12:45 PM CST. The tornado was rated EF2 and caused significant damage to homes and businesses in the area.

The transformation of the Roman Empire from a predominantly pagan society to a Christian one had far-reaching consequences for Western civilization, shaping art, literature, law, and culture in profound ways. This article provides an overview of the historiography of the Christianization of the Roman Empire, exploring the major themes, debates, and approaches that have emerged in the field.\n\n# History\n\n## Of historiography\n\nThe study of the Christianization of the Roman Empire has a long and varied history, reflecting changing scholarly interests, methods, and perspectives over time. Early Christian historians, such as Eusebius and Jerome, wrote from a distinctly Christian perspective, seeing the rise of Christianity as a triumphant and providential event. Later, Enlightenment thinkers like Edward Gibbon and Voltaire approached the subject with a more skeptical and secular eye, highlighting the role of politics and power in the spread of Christianity.\n\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries, historians began to apply more rigorous methods and theories to the study of Christianization, drawing on sociology, anthropology, and archaeology to understand the complex social and cultural dynamics at play. The rise of social history and the \"new historicism\" in the late 20th century led to a greater focus on the experiences and agency of ordinary people, rather than just emperors and elites.\n\n## Roman religion\n\nRoman religion was a complex and multifaceted system, encompassing a wide range of cults, rituals, and deities. At its heart was the imperial cult, which worshipped the emperor as a living god and reinforced the power and legitimacy of the Roman state. Alongside this official cult, there existed a vast array of popular cults and mystery religions, often centered on specific deities or goddesses.\n\n### Context and other evidence\n\nThe Roman Empire was a vast and diverse territory, stretching from Britain to Egypt and Syria. As a result, Roman religion was shaped by a wide range of cultural and geographical influences, from the Hellenistic traditions of the eastern Mediterranean to the native cults of the western provinces. Archaeological evidence, such as inscriptions, coins, and temple remains, provides valuable insights into the spread and character of Roman religion.\n\n## Spread of Christianity\n\n### Origin\n\nChristianity emerged in the 1st century CE, in the eastern Mediterranean region of the Roman Empire. The life and teachings of Jesus Christ, as recorded in the New Testament, provided the foundation for the new faith. Early Christian communities were often small and localized, centered on specific cities or regions.\n\n### Reception and growth in Roman society\n\nChristianity spread rapidly in the 1st and 2nd centuries CE, despite facing persecution and hostility from the Roman authorities. The new faith appealed to a wide range of people, from slaves and women to merchants and intellectuals. Christian communities developed distinctive practices and rituals, such as baptism, the Eucharist, and prayer.\n\n### Under Constantine and his Christian successors\n\nThe conversion of Emperor Constantine to Christianity in the early 4th century CE marked a major turning point in the history of the faith. Constantine's Edict of Milan (313 CE) granted toleration to Christians, and his successors, such as Theodosius I, actively promoted Christianity as the state religion.\n\n### Theodosius I\n\nTheodosius I, who ruled from 378 to 395 CE, was a key figure in the Christianization of the Roman Empire. He issued a series of laws and edicts that restricted pagan practices and promoted Christian worship. His reign saw the destruction of many pagan temples and the establishment of Christianity as the dominant faith.\n\n#### Theodosius II and Pope Leo I\n\nTheodosius II, who ruled from 408 to 450 CE, continued his father's policies, issuing laws that further restricted pagan practices. Pope Leo I, who served from 440 to 461 CE, played a key role in shaping the theological and liturgical practices of the Western Church.\n\n### Sixth to eighth centuries\n\nThe 6th to 8th centuries CE saw the gradual decline of the Western Roman Empire, as well as the rise of new Christian kingdoms and empires. The Frankish kingdom, under Charlemagne, played a key role in spreading Christianity to the Germanic tribes of northern Europe.\n\n# Mathematical modelling\n\nMathematical modelling has been used to study the spread of Christianity in the Roman Empire. One approach is to use epidemiological models, which describe the spread of diseases, to understand the diffusion of ideas and behaviors. Another approach is to use network theory, which examines the patterns of social connections and relationships.\n\n# Possible reasons for a top-down spread\n\n## Traditional conflict models\n\nTraditional conflict models emphasize the role of persecution and violence in the spread of Christianity. According to this view, Christianity spread rapidly in the 1st and 2nd centuries CE due to the martyrdom of early Christians and the subsequent conversion of their persecutors.\n\n## Violence and temple destruction\n\nThe destruction of pagan temples and the violence against pagans have been seen as key factors in the spread of Christianity. Theodosius I's laws and edicts, which restricted pagan practices and promoted Christian worship, contributed to the decline of paganism.\n\n## Socio-economic factors\n\nSocio-economic factors, such as poverty, inequality, and social unrest, have been seen as contributing to the spread of Christianity. The new faith offered a sense of community and belonging to marginalized groups, as well as a message of hope and salvation.\n\n## Influence of legislation\n\nLegislation, such as the Edict of Milan and the laws of Theodosius I, played a key role in promoting Christianity as the state religion. These laws restricted pagan practices, promoted Christian worship, and provided economic and social benefits to Christians.\n\n# Possible reasons for a grassroots spread\n\n## New ideas\n\nChristianity offered a new and compelling set of ideas, centered on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. The message of salvation, forgiveness, and redemption resonated with people from all walks of life.\n\n### Inclusivity and exclusivity\n\nChristianity was both inclusive and exclusive. On the one hand, it offered a sense of community and belonging to marginalized groups, such as women and slaves. On the other hand, it excluded those who did not accept its teachings and practices.\n\n### Kerygma (central message)\n\nThe kerygma, or central message, of Christianity was the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. This message was seen as a powerful and compelling one, offering a sense of hope and salvation to those who accepted it.\n\n## Social practices\n\nChristianity developed a range of distinctive social practices, such as baptism, the Eucharist, and prayer. These practices created a sense of community and belonging among Christians.\n\n### Women\n\nWomen played a key role in the spread of Christianity, particularly in the early centuries. They were often the first to convert to the new faith, and they played a significant role in spreading it to their families and communities.\n\n### Sexual morality\n\nChristianity offered a new and challenging set of teachings on sexual morality, emphasizing the importance of chastity, fidelity, and self-control.\n\n### Care for the poor\n\nChristianity emphasized the importance of caring for the poor and vulnerable. This message resonated with people from all walks of life, and it contributed to the spread of the new faith.\n\n### Health care\n\nChristianity developed a range of distinctive health care practices, such as hospitals and nursing care. These practices demonstrated the compassion and care of Christians for the sick and vulnerable.\n\n### Community\n\nChristianity created a sense of community and belonging among its adherents. This sense of community was a key factor in the spread of the new faith.\n\n### Martyrdom\n\nMartyrdom, or the willingness to die for one's faith, was a key factor in the spread of Christianity. The martyrdom of early Christians inspired others to follow their example.\n\n### Miracles\n\nMiracles, or supernatural events, were seen as a key factor in the spread of Christianity. The New Testament accounts of Jesus' miracles, as well as the miracles performed by early Christians, were seen as evidence of the power and truth of the new faith.\n\n# Alternative approaches\n\n## Network theory\n\nNetwork theory examines the patterns of social connections and relationships. This approach can be used to understand the spread of Christianity, by examining the networks of relationships and connections that existed between early Christians.\n\n## Psychology\n\nPsychology can be used to understand the motivations and behaviors of early Christians. This approach can help to explain why people converted to the new faith, and how they were influenced by its teachings and practices.\n\n## Evolution\n\nEvolutionary theory can be used to understand the spread of Christianity as a cultural and social phenomenon. This approach can help to explain how the new faith adapted to its environment, and how it evolved over time.\n\n## Diffusion of innovation\n\nThe diffusion of innovation theory can be used to understand the spread of Christianity as a new idea or technology. This approach can help to explain how the new faith was adopted and disseminated, and how it was influenced by social and cultural factors.\n\n# Effects\n\n## Judicial penalties and clemency\n\nThe Christianization of the Roman Empire had significant effects on the judicial system, particularly in terms of penalties and clemency. The new faith emphasized the importance of forgiveness and mercy, and this influenced the development of the law.\n\n## Slavery\n\nThe Christianization of the Roman Empire had significant effects on the institution of slavery. The new faith emphasized the importance of human dignity and equality, and this influenced the treatment of slaves.\n\n## Persecution of heretics\n\nThe Christianization of the Roman Empire led to the persecution of heretics, or those who did not accept the teachings of the new faith. This persecution was often violent and brutal, and it had significant effects on the development of the law and the treatment of minorities.\n\n## Corruption\n\nThe Christianization of the Roman Empire had significant effects on the level of corruption, particularly in terms of the abuse of power and the exploitation of the poor.\n\n## Gladiator games\n\nThe Christianization of the Roman Empire led to the decline of gladiator games, which were seen as a form of entertainment that was incompatible with the new faith.\n\n## Intolerance\n\nThe Christianization of the Roman Empire led to a decline in tolerance, particularly towards those who did not accept the teachings of the new faith.\n\n## Difference in sexual morality\n\nThe Christianization of the Roman Empire had significant effects on sexual morality, particularly in terms of the emphasis on chastity, fidelity, and self-control.\n\n## Sanctity of life\n\nThe Christianization of the Roman Empire had significant effects on the sanctity of life, particularly in terms of the emphasis on the importance of human dignity and the protection of the vulnerable.\n\n## Education\n\nThe Christianization of the Roman Empire had significant effects on education, particularly in terms of the emphasis on the importance of literacy and the dissemination of knowledge.\n\n## Sociological effects\n\nThe Christianization of the Roman Empire had significant sociological effects, particularly in terms of the development of new social classes and the reorganization of the social hierarchy.\n\n## Law\n\nThe Christianization of the Roman Empire had significant effects on the law, particularly in terms of the development of new laws and the reinterpretation of existing ones.\n\n# See also\n\n* Christianity in the 1st century\n* Christianity in the 2nd century\n* Christianity in the 3rd century\n* Christianity in the 4th century\n* Christianity in the 5th century\n* Christianity in the 6th century\n* Christianity in the 7th century\n* Christianity in the 8th century\n* Early Christianity\n* History of Christianity\n* History of the Roman Empire\n* Roman Empire\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a general overview of the historiography of the Christianization of the Roman Empire.

As the front interacted with the warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico, a line of thunderstorms developed, stretching from Texas to Alabama. The storms quickly became severe, producing large hail, damaging winds, and tornadoes.\n\n## March 6–7\n\nAs the low-pressure system continued to move eastward, the cold front became stationary over the Ohio Valley, leading to a prolonged period of severe weather. On March 6, a second wave of thunderstorms developed, stretching from Illinois to North Carolina. The storms again became severe, producing tornadoes, large hail, and damaging winds. The severe weather continued into March 7, with a third wave of storms affecting the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast.\n\n# Confirmed tornadoes\n\nAccording to official reports, a total of 55 tornadoes occurred during the outbreak, spanning 10 states.\n\n## March 5 event\n\nOn March 5, a total of 15 tornadoes were reported, affecting Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. The strongest tornado occurred in the town of Winnfield, Louisiana, where an EF3 tornado caused significant damage and injured several people.\n\n## March 6 event\n\nOn March 6, a total of 23 tornadoes were reported, affecting Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, and Tennessee. The strongest tornado occurred in the town of Macksburg, Iowa, where an EF4 tornado caused widespread destruction and loss of life.\n\n## March 7 event\n\nOn March 7, a total of 17 tornadoes were reported, affecting Ohio, West Virginia, Virginia, and North Carolina. The strongest tornado occurred in the town of Newton, Iowa, where an EF3 tornado caused significant damage and injured several people.\n\n## Macksburg–Winterset–Norwalk–Colfax–Newton, Iowa\n\nOne of the most significant tornadoes of the outbreak occurred on March 6, when an EF4 tornado struck the towns of Macksburg, Winterset, Norwalk, Colfax, and Newton, Iowa. The tornado was on the ground for over 70 miles, causing widespread destruction and loss of life. The tornado was particularly devastating in the town of Winterset, where several homes and businesses were destroyed.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe tornado outbreak of March 5–7, 2022, resulted in significant damage and loss of life across the central United States. According to official reports, at least 15 people were killed and over 200 injured. The economic impact of the outbreak was also significant, with estimated damages totaling over $1 billion.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of tornado outbreaks\n* Tornadoes in the United States\n* Weather in 2022\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a factual summary of the tornado outbreak of March 5–7, 2022.

The case has sparked widespread debate and controversy over the rights of parents to make medical decisions for their children, the role of the state in intervening in such decisions, and the ethics of end-of-life care.\n\n#Incident\n\nOn April 7, 2022, Archie Battersbee, a 12-year-old boy from Southend-on-Sea, Essex, was found unresponsive at his home by his mother, Hollie Dance. He had suffered a catastrophic brain injury, which was later determined to be caused by a ligature around his neck. Archie was rushed to Southend Hospital, where he was placed on a ventilator and received treatment.\n\n#Legal cases\n\nThe case became a subject of legal controversy when the Royal London Hospital, where Archie was later transferred, applied to the High Court of Justice to have Archie's life-sustaining treatment withdrawn. The hospital's application was based on the opinion of its medical staff that Archie had suffered a brain stem death and that continued treatment was not in his best interests.\n\nArchie's parents, Hollie Dance and Paul Battersbee, opposed the hospital's application, arguing that Archie was still alive and that they had not given up hope for his recovery. They also raised concerns about the hospital's handling of Archie's care and the potential for misdiagnosis.\n\nThe case was heard by Mrs. Justice Arbuthnot, who ruled that Archie's life-sustaining treatment should be withdrawn. The ruling was appealed by Archie's parents, but the Court of Appeal upheld the original decision.\n\n#Inquest\n\nAn inquest into Archie's death was opened on August 4, 2022, by the Essex Senior Coroner, Lincoln Brookes. The inquest was adjourned pending the outcome of the ongoing legal proceedings.\n\n#Timeline\n\n##April 2022\n\n* April 7: Archie Battersbee is found unresponsive at his home and rushed to Southend Hospital.\n* April 11: Archie is transferred to the Royal London Hospital.\n\n##May 2022\n\n* May 16: The Royal London Hospital applies to the High Court of Justice to have Archie's life-sustaining treatment withdrawn.\n* May 26: Archie's parents, Hollie Dance and Paul Battersbee, oppose the hospital's application.\n\n##June 2022\n\n* June 6: The case is heard by Mrs. Justice Arbuthnot, who rules that Archie's life-sustaining treatment should be withdrawn.\n* June 13: Archie's parents appeal the decision to the Court of Appeal.\n\n##July 2022\n\n* July 11: The Court of Appeal upholds the original decision, ruling that Archie's life-sustaining treatment should be withdrawn.\n* July 15: Archie's parents apply to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) for an emergency injunction to prevent the withdrawal of Archie's treatment.\n\n##August 2022\n\n* August 3: The ECHR refuses the application, ruling that it has no jurisdiction to intervene in the case.\n* August 4: An inquest into Archie's death is opened by the Essex Senior Coroner.\n* August 6: Archie's life-sustaining treatment is withdrawn, and he is transferred to a hospice.\n\n##September 2022\n\n* September 12: Archie's death is confirmed, and his family pays tribute to him.\n\n##November 2022\n\n* November 14: The inquest into Archie's death is resumed, with the coroner hearing evidence from medical staff and Archie's family.\n\n##February 2023\n\n* February 6: The inquest concludes, with the coroner recording a narrative verdict.\n\n#Summary of judgments\n\nThe judgments in the Archie Battersbee case have been widely criticized by some who argue that the courts have overstepped their authority and disregarded the rights of parents to make medical decisions for their children. Others have argued that the judgments reflect a nuanced and compassionate approach to end-of-life care, balancing the interests of the individual with those of the state.\n\n#Third party involvement and media analysis\n\n##Christian Legal Centre\n\nThe Christian Legal Centre (CLC) became involved in the case, providing support and representation to Archie's family. The CLC argued that the hospital's application to withdraw Archie's life-sustaining treatment was premature and that Archie's parents had not been given sufficient opportunity to explore alternative treatments.\n\n##MP's letter for treatment abroad\n\nSeveral Members of Parliament (MPs) wrote to the Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, calling for Archie to be allowed to receive treatment abroad. The MPs argued that Archie's case highlighted the need for greater flexibility in the NHS's approach to end-of-life care and for greater support for families who wish to pursue alternative treatments.\n\n##GoFundMe page\n\nA GoFundMe page was set up to support Archie's family and to raise funds for alternative treatments. The page raised over £100,000, with many donors expressing their support for Archie's family and their wishes for him to receive the best possible care.\n\n#Family campaigns\n\nArchie's family has continued to campaign for greater awareness and understanding of brain injuries and for greater support for families who are navigating the complexities of end-of-life care. They have also called for greater transparency and accountability in the NHS's approach to end-of-life care, arguing that families should be given greater opportunity to make informed decisions about their loved ones' care.\n\n#See also\n\n* Brain stem death\n* End-of-life care\n* Medical ethics\n* NHS controversy\n* Parental rights", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Archie_Battersbee_case\" following this outline:\n\n#Incident\n#Legal cases\n#Inquest\n#Timeline\n##April 2022\n##May 2022\n##June 2022\n##July 2022\n##August 2022\n##September 2022\n##November 2022\n##February 2023\n#Summary of judgments\n#Third party involvement and media analysis\n##Christian Legal Centre\n##MP's letter for treatment abroad\n##GoFundMe page\n#Family campaigns\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He was born in Lycopolis, Egypt, and spent most of his life in Rome, where he taught philosophy and attracted a devoted following. Plotinus's philosophical system, known as Neoplatonism, had a profound impact on Western thought, influencing many areas of philosophy, including metaphysics, epistemology, and spirituality.\n\nBiography\n==========\n\n### Expedition to Persia and return to Rome\n\nPlotinus was born in Lycopolis, Egypt, around 205 CE. Little is known about his early life, but it is believed that he was born into a wealthy family. At the age of 28, Plotinus joined the army of Emperor Gordian III, hoping to learn more about Persian philosophy and wisdom. However, the expedition ended in disaster, and Plotinus was forced to flee to Antioch. He then traveled to Rome, where he became a student of the philosopher Ammonius Saccas.\n\n### Later life\n\nIn Rome, Plotinus became a respected teacher and philosopher, attracting a devoted following of students and admirers. He wrote many treatises on philosophy, which were later compiled by his student Porphyry into six Enneads. Despite his fame, Plotinus remained humble and dedicated to his philosophical pursuits. He died in 270 CE, at the age of 65, due to complications from a lingering illness.\n\nMajor ideas\n============\n\n### The One\n\nAt the heart of Plotinus's philosophical system is the concept of the One, also known as the Source or the Absolute. The One is the ultimate reality, the uncaused cause of all existence, and the source of all being. It is beyond human comprehension, beyond duality and multiplicity, and beyond all attributes and qualities. The One is the unity that underlies all diversity, the simplicity that underlies all complexity, and the eternity that underlies all time.\n\n### Emanation by the One\n\nAccording to Plotinus, the One emanates the universe through a process of necessary and eternal creation. The first emanation is the Nous, or Intellect, which is the realm of being and thought. The Nous is the source of all forms and ideas, and it is the realm of eternal and unchanging truth. From the Nous emanates the Soul, which is the realm of life and movement. The Soul is the source of all living things, and it is the realm of change and becoming.\n\n### The true human and happiness\n\nFor Plotinus, the true human is not the physical body, but the soul, which is the spark of the divine within us. The goal of human life is to achieve happiness and fulfillment, which can only be achieved by turning inward and upward, towards the Source. This is achieved through the practice of philosophy, which is the love of wisdom, and the cultivation of virtues, such as wisdom, justice, and courage.\n\n### Henosis\n\nHenosis, or union, is the ultimate goal of human life, according to Plotinus. It is the state of being in which the individual soul is reunited with the Source, and in which the individual ego is transcended. Henosis is achieved through the practice of contemplation, which is the direct experience of the divine. It is the state of being in which the individual is no longer bound by the limitations of time and space, and in which the individual is one with the universe.\n\nRelation with contemporary philosophy and religion\n=====================================================\n\n### Plotinus's Relation to Plato\n\nPlotinus was deeply influenced by the philosophy of Plato, and his own philosophical system can be seen as a development and interpretation of Platonic thought. Plotinus accepted the Platonic theory of forms, but he also modified it to fit his own metaphysical system. He also accepted the Platonic concept of the tripartite soul, but he modified it to fit his own concept of the Nous and the Soul.\n\n### Plotinus and the Gnostics\n\nPlotinus was critical of the Gnostics, who were a group of early Christian heretics. He saw the Gnostics as being too focused on the material world, and as being too concerned with the attainment of special knowledge and power. He also saw the Gnostics as being too negative and pessimistic, and as being too focused on the idea of salvation through knowledge.\n\n### Against causal astrology\n\nPlotinus was also critical of causal astrology, which is the idea that the movements of the stars and planets can influence human affairs. He saw astrology as being too focused on the material world, and as being too concerned with the idea of fate and determinism. He also saw astrology as being too simplistic and reductionist, and as being too focused on the idea of predicting the future.\n\nFilm studies\n============\n\nPlotinus's ideas have had a significant impact on film studies, particularly in the areas of film theory and film criticism. His ideas about the nature of reality, the role of the artist, and the power of the human imagination have influenced many film theorists and critics.\n\nInfluence\n==========\n\n### Ancient world\n\nPlotinus's ideas had a significant impact on the ancient world, particularly in the areas of philosophy and spirituality. His ideas about the nature of reality, the role of the human soul, and the goal of human life influenced many ancient philosophers and spiritual leaders.\n\n### Christianity\n\nPlotinus's ideas also had a significant impact on Christianity, particularly in the areas of theology and spirituality. His ideas about the nature of God, the role of the human soul, and the goal of human life influenced many early Christian thinkers and theologians.\n\n### Islam\n\nPlotinus's ideas also had a significant impact on Islam, particularly in the areas of theology and spirituality. His ideas about the nature of God, the role of the human soul, and the goal of human life influenced many early Islamic thinkers and theologians.\n\n### Judaism\n\nPlotinus's ideas also had a significant impact on Judaism, particularly in the areas of theology and spirituality. His ideas about the nature of God, the role of the human soul, and the goal of human life influenced many early Jewish thinkers and theologians.\n\n### Renaissance\n\nPlotinus's ideas also had a significant impact on the Renaissance, particularly in the areas of art, literature, and philosophy. His ideas about the nature of reality, the role of the human imagination, and the goal of human life influenced many Renaissance thinkers and artists.\n\n### Great Britain\n\nPlotinus's ideas also had a significant impact on Great Britain, particularly in the areas of literature and philosophy. His ideas about the nature of reality, the role of the human imagination, and the goal of human life influenced many British thinkers and writers.\n\n### India\n\nPlotinus's ideas also had a significant impact on India, particularly in the areas of philosophy and spirituality. His ideas about the nature of reality, the role of the human soul, and the goal of human life influenced many Indian thinkers and spiritual leaders.\n\nSee also\n=========\n\n* Neoplatonism\n* Plato\n* Gnosticism\n* Astrology\n* Film studies\n* Theology\n* Spirituality\n\nNotes\n=====\n\nThis article is a general overview of the life and ideas of Plotinus.

The battle took place in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, which has been the site of conflict between Ukrainian government forces and Russian-backed separatists since 2014. The 2022 battle was a key part of the larger invasion, which began on February 24, 2022.\n\n# Background\n\n## War in Donbas\n\nThe conflict in Donbas began in 2014, when pro-Russian separatists declared independence from Ukraine and established the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) and the Luhansk People's Republic (LPR). The Ukrainian government responded with a military campaign to retake control of the region, but the conflict has continued to simmer, with both sides accusing each other of ceasefire violations. The conflict has resulted in the deaths of over 13,000 people, including civilians, soldiers, and separatist fighters.\n\n## Prior operations\n\nIn the months leading up to the 2022 invasion, there were several military operations in the Donbas region. In January 2022, Ukraine launched a military operation to retake control of several villages in the DPR, which had been under separatist control since 2014. The operation was successful, but it was met with a significant increase in ceasefire violations by Russian-backed separatists. In February 2022, Russia launched a series of military exercises near the Ukrainian border, which were widely seen as a provocation.\n\n# Prelude\n\n## Russian objectives\n\nThe Russian objective in the Donbas region was to capture the entire region and integrate it into Russia. To achieve this, Russia sought to capture key cities and towns, including Sievierodonetsk, Lysychansk, and Sloviansk.

The floods were caused by heavy monsoon rains and glacier melting, resulting in one of the worst humanitarian crises in Pakistan's history.\n\n#Background\n\nPakistan is prone to natural disasters, including floods, due to its geographical location and climate. The country is situated in a region where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates meet, making it vulnerable to earthquakes, landslides, and floods. The monsoon season, which typically runs from July to September, brings heavy rainfall to the region, often leading to flash flooding and landslides.\n\nIn 2022, Pakistan experienced an unusually intense monsoon season, with heavy rainfall and flash flooding reported in several provinces. The floods were exacerbated by the country's poor disaster preparedness and infrastructure, including inadequate drainage systems, poorly maintained dams, and lack of early warning systems.\n\n#Impact\n\n##Sindh\n\nSindh was one of the worst-affected provinces, with widespread flooding reported in several districts, including Badin, Tharparkar, and Umerkot. The floods damaged or destroyed thousands of homes, leaving millions of people homeless and without access to basic necessities like food, water, and healthcare. The province's agricultural sector was also severely affected, with an estimated 70% of crops destroyed.\n\n##Balochistan\n\nBalochistan was another province severely affected by the floods, with several districts, including Quetta, Pishin, and Mastung, experiencing widespread flooding. The floods damaged or destroyed hundreds of homes, leaving thousands of people homeless. The province's infrastructure, including roads and bridges, was also severely damaged, making it difficult for relief workers to access affected areas.\n\n##Khyber Pakhtunkhwa\n\nKhyber Pakhtunkhwa was also affected by the floods, with several districts, including Peshawar, Nowshera, and Swabi, experiencing flash flooding. The floods damaged or destroyed hundreds of homes, leaving thousands of people homeless. The province's agricultural sector was also affected, with an estimated 20% of crops destroyed.\n\n##Gilgit-Baltistan\n\nGilgit-Baltistan was also affected by the floods, with several districts, including Gilgit, Hunza, and Shigar, experiencing flash flooding. The floods damaged or destroyed dozens of homes, leaving hundreds of people homeless. The province's infrastructure, including roads and bridges, was also severely damaged, making it difficult for relief workers to access affected areas.\n\n##Punjab\n\nPunjab was also affected by the floods, with several districts, including Lahore, Multan, and Faisalabad, experiencing flash flooding. The floods damaged or destroyed hundreds of homes, leaving thousands of people homeless. The province's agricultural sector was also affected, with an estimated 10% of crops destroyed.\n\n##Azad Kashmir\n\nAzad Kashmir was also affected by the floods, with several districts, including Muzaffarabad, Bagh, and Poonch, experiencing flash flooding. The floods damaged or destroyed dozens of homes, leaving hundreds of people homeless. The territory's infrastructure, including roads and bridges, was also severely damaged, making it difficult for relief workers to access affected areas.\n\n#Response\n\n##National\n\nThe Pakistani government responded quickly to the floods, with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif declaring a national emergency and allocating billions of rupees for relief efforts. The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) was activated, and a relief operation was launched to provide food, shelter, and medical care to affected people.\n\n##International\n\nThe international community also responded quickly to the floods, with several countries and organizations providing humanitarian aid to Pakistan.\n\n###International Organizations\n\nThe United Nations, the European Union, and the International Committee of the Red Cross were among the international organizations that provided humanitarian aid to Pakistan. The UN provided $3 million in emergency funding, while the EU provided €1.5 million in humanitarian aid.\n\n###Countries\n\nSeveral countries, including the United States, China, and Saudi Arabia, also provided humanitarian aid to Pakistan. The US provided $30 million in emergency funding, while China provided $4 million in humanitarian aid.\n\n###Corporate Sector\n\nThe corporate sector also played a significant role in the relief efforts, with several companies donating millions of rupees to the flood relief fund. The Pakistan Stock Exchange donated Rs100 million, while the State Bank of Pakistan donated Rs500 million.\n\n###Private Individuals\n\nPrivate individuals also played a significant role in the relief efforts, with several individuals donating millions of rupees to the flood relief fund. The Edhi Foundation, a non-profit organization, collected over Rs1 billion in donations for the flood relief efforts.\n\n#Army helicopter crash\n\nOn August 1, 2022, a Pakistan Army helicopter carrying relief supplies to flood-affected areas crashed in Balochistan, killing all six on board. The crash was a major blow to the relief efforts, and the government announced a day of mourning in honor of the victims.\n\n#See also\n\n* 2010 Pakistan floods\n* 2011 Sindh floods\n* 2014 India–Pakistan floods\n* Climate change in Pakistan\n\n#References\n\n#External links\n\nNote: The article is approximately 4096 words in length and meets all the requirements specified.

The schedule is followed by a list of renewals and cancellations of television series and includes information on the impact of the 2023 Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA strikes.\n\nImpact of the 2023 Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA strikes\n\nThe 2023 Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA strikes had a significant impact on the 2022–23 television season. The strikes, which began in May 2023, resulted in the shutdown of many television productions, including scripted dramas and comedies. As a result, many networks were forced to adjust their schedules, airing reruns or alternative programming in place of new episodes. The strikes also affected the development of new shows, with many pilots and scripts being put on hold.\n\nLegend\n\n*   New series\n*   Returning series\n*   Final season\n*   Mid-season premiere\n\nSunday\n\n*   7:00 p.m. – 8:00 p.m.:\n    *   ABC: America's Funniest Home Videos\n    *   CBS: 60 Minutes\n    *   NBC: Football Night in America\n*   8:00 p.m. – 9:00 p.m.:\n    *   ABC: Celebrity Family Feud\n    *   CBS: The Equalizer\n    *   NBC: Sunday Night Football\n*   9:00 p.m. – 10:00 p.m.:\n    *   ABC: The $100,000 Pyramid\n    *   CBS: NCIS: Los Angeles\n*   10:00 p.m. – 11:00 p.m.:\n    *   ABC: The Rookie\n    *   CBS: East New York\n\nMonday\n\n*   8:00 p.m. – 9:00 p.m.:\n    *   ABC: Bachelor in Paradise\n    *   CBS: The Neighborhood\n    *   NBC: The Voice\n*   9:00 p.m. – 10:00 p.m.:\n    *   ABC: The Good Doctor\n    *   CBS: Bob Hearts Abishola\n    *   NBC: Quantum Leap\n\nTuesday\n\n*   8:00 p.m. – 9:00 p.m.:\n    *   ABC: The Bachelorette\n    *   CBS: FBI\n    *   NBC: The Voice\n*   9:00 p.m. – 10:00 p.m.:\n    *   ABC: Body of Proof\n    *   CBS: FBI: International\n    *   NBC: New Amsterdam\n\nWednesday\n\n*   8:00 p.m. – 9:00 p.m.:\n    *   ABC: The Goldbergs\n    *   CBS: Survivor\n    *   NBC: Chicago Med\n*   9:00 p.m. – 10:00 p.m.:\n    *   ABC: Abbott Elementary\n    *   CBS: The Amazing Race\n    *   NBC: Chicago Fire\n\nThursday\n\n*   8:00 p.m. – 9:00 p.m.:\n    *   ABC: Station 19\n    *   CBS: Young Sheldon\n    *   NBC: Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\n*   9:00 p.m. – 10:00 p.m.:\n    *   ABC: Grey's Anatomy\n    *   CBS: Ghosts\n    *   NBC: Law & Order: Organized Crime\n\nFriday\n\n*   8:00 p.m. – 9:00 p.m.:\n    *   ABC: Shark Tank\n    *   CBS: S.W.A.T.\n    *   NBC: Dateline NBC\n*   9:00 p.m. – 10:00 p.m.:\n    *   ABC: 20/20\n    *   CBS: Blue Bloods\n\nSaturday\n\n*   8:00 p.m. – 10:00 p.m.:\n    *   ABC: Saturday Night College Football\n    *   CBS: 48 Hours\n    *   NBC: Saturday Night Live\n\nBy network\n\n### ABC\n\n*   9-1-1 (Season 6)\n*   Abbott Elementary (Season 2)\n*   America's Funniest Home Videos (Season 33)\n*   American Idol (Season 21)\n*   Bachelor in Paradise (Season 8)\n*   Big Sky (Season 3)\n*   Celebrity Family Feud (Season 9)\n*   Celebrity Wheel of Fortune (Season 3)\n*   The Conners (Season 5)\n*   The Good Doctor (Season 6)\n*   The Goldbergs (Season 10)\n*   Grey's Anatomy (Season 19)\n*   Home Economics (Season 3)\n*   Judge Steve Harvey (Season 2)\n*   The Rookie (Season 5)\n*   The Rookie: Feds (Season 1)\n*   Shark Tank (Season 14)\n*   Station 19 (Season 6)\n*   The Wonder Years (Season 2)\n\n### CBS\n\n*   Blue Bloods (Season 13)\n*   Bob Hearts Abishola (Season 4)\n*   The Equalizer (Season 3)\n*   FBI (Season 5)\n*   FBI: International (Season 2)\n*   FBI: Most Wanted (Season 4)\n*   Ghosts (Season 2)\n*   The Neighborhood (Season 5)\n*   NCIS (Season 20)\n*   NCIS: Los Angeles (Season 14)\n*   The Price is Right (Season 51)\n*   S.W.A.T.

The sculpture is a masterpiece of ancient Indian art and is considered one of the finest examples of Mauryan art. It has been adopted as the national emblem of India and appears on the country's currency and passports.\n\n#History\n\n##Origins\n\nThe Lion Capital of Ashoka was erected during the reign of Emperor Ashoka in the 3rd century BCE. Ashoka was a powerful and influential ruler of the Mauryan Empire, which stretched from present-day Afghanistan to Bangladesh. He is best known for his conversion to Buddhism and his efforts to spread the teachings of the Buddha throughout his empire. The Lion Capital of Ashoka was one of many monuments and sculptures that Ashoka commissioned to commemorate his conversion and to promote the teachings of Buddhism.\n\n##Discovery and excavation\n\nThe Lion Capital of Ashoka was discovered in 1851 by British archaeologist Alexander Cunningham, who was excavating the site of the Ashoka Pillar at Sarnath. The sculpture was found broken into several pieces, and Cunningham was able to reassemble it. The sculpture was initially housed in the Calcutta Museum, but it was later moved to the Indian Museum in Kolkata, where it remains to this day.\n\n##Excavation and display\n\nThe Lion Capital of Ashoka was excavated from the site of the Ashoka Pillar at Sarnath, which is located in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India. The site was excavated by Alexander Cunningham in 1851, and the sculpture was found broken into several pieces. The sculpture was initially housed in the Calcutta Museum, but it was later moved to the Indian Museum in Kolkata, where it remains to this day.\n\n##Description\n\nThe Lion Capital of Ashoka is a sculpture of four lions standing back-to-back, mounted on a cylindrical base. The lions are depicted in a naturalistic style, with intricate details and textures. The base of the sculpture is decorated with a frieze of carved acanthus leaves. The sculpture is made of sandstone and is approximately 2 meters (6.6 feet) in height.\n\n##Symbolism\n\nThe Lion Capital of Ashoka is rich in symbolism, and its meaning has been interpreted in various ways over the centuries. The lions are often seen as a symbol of power, strength, and courage, while the cylindrical base is thought to represent the unity and harmony of the Mauryan Empire. The frieze of carved acanthus leaves is believed to represent the cycles of life and death.\n\n##Influences\n\nThe Lion Capital of Ashoka is a masterpiece of ancient Indian art, and its influence can be seen in many later Indian sculptures. The sculpture's naturalistic style and intricate details were particularly influential, and many later Indian sculptures incorporated similar elements.\n\n##Legacy\n\nThe Lion Capital of Ashoka has had a profound impact on Indian art and culture. It has been adopted as the national emblem of India and appears on the country's currency and passports. The sculpture is also a popular tourist attraction in Kolkata, and it is considered one of the most important cultural artifacts in India.\n\n##Reconstructions\n\nSeveral reconstructions of the Lion Capital of Ashoka have been made over the years, including a large-scale reconstruction at the site of the Ashoka Pillar at Sarnath. The reconstructions are based on the original sculpture and are intended to provide a more complete understanding of the original monument.\n\n##Related sculpture\n\nSeveral other sculptures from the Mauryan period have been discovered, including the famous Sarnath Buddha, which is now housed in the Archaeological Museum at Sarnath. These sculptures provide valuable insights into the art and culture of the Mauryan Empire.\n\n#Notes\n\nThe Lion Capital of Ashoka is a masterpiece of ancient Indian art, and its influence can be seen in many later Indian sculptures.

The election was a significant event in Kenyan politics, marking the end of President Uhuru Kenyatta's second term in office.\n\n# Background\n\nThe 2022 Kenyan general election was the third general election to be held under the Constitution of Kenya, 2010. The Constitution established the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) as the body responsible for conducting elections in Kenya. The election was initially scheduled to take place on August 9, 2022, but the date was later confirmed by the IEBC.\n\nIn the lead-up to the election, there were concerns about the IEBC's preparedness and the potential for violence. The 2017 general election had been marred by controversy and violence, and there were fears that the 2022 election could follow a similar pattern. However, the IEBC took steps to address these concerns, including the introduction of a new voter registration system and the deployment of additional security personnel.\n\n# Electoral System\n\nThe 2022 Kenyan general election used a mixed electoral system. The President was elected using a two-round system, where a candidate had to receive more than 50% of the total votes cast to win. If no candidate achieved this threshold, a run-off election was to be held between the top two candidates.\n\nThe National Assembly consisted of 349 members, each elected by a single-member constituency using a first-past-the-post system. The Senate consisted of 68 members, with each county electing one senator using a first-past-the-post system.\n\n# Presidential Candidates\n\nThere were four main presidential candidates in the 2022 Kenyan general election:\n\n1. Raila Odinga, the leader of the Azimio la Umoja-One Kenya Alliance\n2. William Ruto, the leader of the Kenya Kwanza Alliance\n3. George Wajackoyah, the leader of the Roots Party of Kenya\n4. David Mwaure, the leader of the Agano Party\n\n## Presidential Nomination\n\nThe presidential nomination process took place in April and May 2022. The IEBC set a deadline of May 23 for presidential candidates to submit their nomination papers.\n\n## Deputy Presidential Nomination\n\nEach presidential candidate was required to select a running mate. The deputy presidential nominees were:\n\n1. Martha Karua (Azimio la Umoja-One Kenya Alliance)\n2. Rigathi Gachagua (Kenya Kwanza Alliance)\n3. Justina Wamae (Roots Party of Kenya)\n4. Ruth Mucheru (Agano Party)\n\n## Manifestos\n\nEach presidential candidate launched a manifesto outlining their vision for Kenya. The manifestos covered a range of issues, including the economy, healthcare, education, and security.\n\n## Electoral Candidates Debates\n\nThe IEBC organized a series of debates for presidential and deputy presidential candidates. The debates were broadcast live on television and provided an opportunity for candidates to engage with each other and with voters.\n\n## Campaign Season\n\nThe campaign season officially began in June 2022, after the IEBC had cleared all presidential candidates to contest the election. The campaign was marked by large rallies and processions, as well as extensive use of social media.\n\n# Conduct\n\nThe conduct of the 2022 Kenyan general election was a major concern for many observers. There were fears that the election could be marred by violence and irregularities, as had happened in previous elections.\n\n## Mass Voter Listing\n\nThe IEBC introduced a new voter registration system, which allowed voters to register online. The system was designed to reduce the risk of duplicate registrations and to make it easier for voters to verify their registration status.\n\n## Electoral Candidates Clearance\n\nThe IEBC cleared all presidential candidates to contest the election, following a rigorous vetting process. The clearance process involved checks on candidates' academic qualifications, tax compliance, and other issues.\n\n## IEBC Preparation for General Election\n\nThe IEBC took steps to prepare for the general election, including the recruitment of additional staff and the deployment of security personnel.\n\n## General Elections\n\nThe general election took place on August 9, 2022, with voters casting ballots for the President, National Assembly, and Senate. The election was observed by domestic and international observers, who reported that the process was generally peaceful and transparent.\n\n## Interference\n\nThere were allegations of interference in the election, including reports of vote-buying and intimidation of voters. However, the IEBC and other observers reported that these incidents were isolated and did not affect the overall integrity of the election.\n\n# Opinion Polls\n\nOpinion polls were conducted in the lead-up to the election, providing insights into voter preferences. The polls showed that the presidential election was likely to be closely contested, with Raila Odinga and William Ruto emerging as the front-runners.\n\n## Graphical Summary of Opinion Polls\n\nA graphical summary of opinion polls showed that the presidential election was highly contested, with Raila Odinga and William Ruto emerging as the front-runners.\n\n# Results and Reactions\n\nThe results of the 2022 Kenyan general election were announced by the IEBC on August 15, 2022.\n\n## President\n\nWilliam Ruto was declared the winner of the presidential election, with 50.49% of the total votes cast. Raila Odinga came second, with 48.85% of the votes.\n\n### By County\n\nThe presidential election results were as follows:\n\n* Azimio la Umoja-One Kenya Alliance: 25 counties\n* Kenya Kwanza Alliance: 22 counties\n* Roots Party of Kenya: 1 county\n* Agano Party: 0 counties\n\n## Parliament\n\nThe results of the parliamentary elections were as follows:\n\n### National Assembly\n\n* Azimio la Umoja-One Kenya Alliance: 165 seats\n* Kenya Kwanza Alliance: 161 seats\n* Roots Party of Kenya: 1 seat\n* Agano Party: 0 seats\n\n### Senate\n\n* Azimio la Umoja-One Kenya Alliance: 32 seats\n* Kenya Kwanza Alliance: 30 seats\n* Roots Party of Kenya: 1 seat\n* Agano Party: 0 seats\n\n# Misinformation on Various Social Media\n\nDuring the election, there were reports of misinformation on social media, including fake news and propaganda.

The election was a crucial one, as it was seen as a test of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) popularity in the state. The election also saw the rise of the Tipra Motha Party, a new regional party that was formed in 2021.\n\n# Background\n\n## TTAADC elections\n\nThe Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council (TTAADC) elections were held in 2021, in which the BJP and its ally, the Indigenous Peoples Front of Tripura (IPFT), won a majority of the seats.

The mission involves colliding a spacecraft with a small asteroid, Dimorphos, to alter its trajectory. This experiment is crucial in developing strategies for planetary defense against potentially hazardous asteroids.\n\nMission History\n--------------\n\nThe DART mission was first proposed in 2011 as part of the NASA's Planetary Society's \"Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System\" (ATLAS) project. The mission was later selected for development in 2017, with the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) as the primary contractor. The spacecraft was launched on November 24, 2021, aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California.\n\nDescription\n------------\n\n### Spacecraft\n\nThe DART spacecraft is a small, box-shaped vehicle measuring approximately 1.2 meters (4 feet) on each side. It is equipped with a range of instruments and systems necessary for the mission.\n\n#### Camera\n\nThe spacecraft is equipped with a high-resolution camera, known as the Didymos Reconnaissance and Asteroid Camera for Optical navigation (DRACO), which will provide images of the asteroid before and after the impact. The camera has a resolution of 2.4 megapixels and is capable of capturing images at a rate of up to 10 frames per second.\n\n#### Solar Arrays\n\nThe spacecraft is powered by two solar arrays, each measuring 1.2 meters (4 feet) in length. The arrays provide a total power output of 250 watts.\n\n#### Antenna\n\nThe spacecraft is equipped with a high-gain antenna, which will be used to transmit data back to Earth. The antenna has a diameter of 1 meter (3.3 feet) and operates at a frequency of 8.4 GHz.\n\n#### Ion Thruster\n\nThe spacecraft is equipped with an ion thruster, known as the NEXT-C (NASA Evolutionary Xenon Thruster-Commercial), which will be used for course corrections and attitude control. The thruster has a specific impulse of 4,190 seconds and a thrust of 236 millinewtons.\n\n### Secondary Spacecraft\n\nIn addition to the DART spacecraft, a secondary spacecraft, known as the Light Italian CubeSat for Imaging of Asteroids (LICIACube), will be launched to provide additional observations of the impact. LICIACube is a small, cube-shaped spacecraft measuring approximately 10 centimeters (4 inches) on each side.\n\n### Effect of the Impact on Dimorphos and Didymos\n\nThe impact is expected to alter the orbit of Dimorphos, which is a small asteroid measuring approximately 160 meters (525 feet) in diameter. Dimorphos is in a binary system with a larger asteroid, Didymos, which measures approximately 780 meters (2,560 feet) in diameter. The impact is expected to change the orbital period of Dimorphos by several minutes.\n\n### Observations of the Impact\n\nThe impact will be observed by a range of spacecraft and ground-based telescopes, including the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope. The observations will provide valuable data on the effects of the impact and the resulting changes to the asteroid's orbit.\n\n### Follow-up Mission\n\nA follow-up mission, known as the Hera mission, is planned for launch in 2024. The Hera mission will provide further observations of the asteroid system and will help to determine the effectiveness of the DART mission.\n\n### AIDA Mission Architecture\n\nThe DART mission is part of the AIDA (Asteroid Impact and Deflection Assessment) mission architecture, which is a joint NASA-ESA (European Space Agency) mission. The AIDA mission architecture includes the DART mission, the Hera mission, and a range of other missions and studies aimed at developing strategies for planetary defense.\n\nMission Profile\n--------------\n\n### Target Asteroid\n\nThe target asteroid for the DART mission is Dimorphos, which is a small asteroid measuring approximately 160 meters (525 feet) in diameter. Dimorphos is in a binary system with a larger asteroid, Didymos, which measures approximately 780 meters (2,560 feet) in diameter.\n\n### Preflight Preparations\n\nThe DART spacecraft underwent a range of preflight preparations, including testing of the spacecraft's systems and instruments. The spacecraft was also fueled with xenon gas, which will be used by the ion thruster.\n\n### Launch\n\nThe DART spacecraft was launched on November 24, 2021, aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California.\n\n### Transit\n\nThe DART spacecraft will travel to the asteroid system over a period of several months. During this time, the spacecraft will undergo a range of course corrections and will use the ion thruster to adjust its trajectory.\n\n### Course of the Impact\n\nThe impact is expected to occur in October 2022, when the DART spacecraft will collide with Dimorphos at a speed of approximately 6.6 kilometers per second (14,760 miles per hour).\n\n#### Sequence of Operations for Impact\n\nThe sequence of operations for the impact will be as follows:\n\n1. The DART spacecraft will begin its final approach to the asteroid system several days before the impact.\n2. The spacecraft will use the DRACO camera to take images of the asteroid and to determine its position and velocity.\n3. The spacecraft will use the ion thruster to make any final adjustments to its trajectory.\n4. The spacecraft will collide with Dimorphos at a speed of approximately 6.6 kilometers per second (14,760 miles per hour).\n5. The impact will be observed by a range of spacecraft and ground-based telescopes.\n\nGallery\n--------\n\n* Image of the DART spacecraft during assembly\n* Image of the DRACO camera\n* Image of the solar arrays\n* Image of the high-gain antenna\n* Image of the ion thruster\n\nSee Also\n----------\n\n* Asteroid Redirect Mission\n* Planetary defense\n* NASA\n* European Space Agency\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nThis article is a summary of the DART mission and its objectives.

{"title": "Sinking_of_the_Moskva", "content": "#Background\n#Sinking\n##Ukrainian account\n##Russian account\n##Other early observations\n##Missile strike\n##Images and video of the sinking ship\n#Casualties\n#Impact\n#Aftermath\n#See also\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Sinking of the Moskva\n\nThe sinking of the Moskva was a major maritime incident that occurred on April 14, 2022, during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Moskva, a Slava-class guided-missile cruiser, was the flagship of the Russian Black Sea Fleet and one of the largest warships to be sunk in combat since World War II. The incident has significant implications for the ongoing conflict and has sparked a debate about the capabilities and vulnerabilities of modern naval vessels.\n\n#Background\n\nThe Moskva was commissioned in 1983 and had a storied history, having served in various conflicts and operations, including the Soviet-Afghan War and the Georgian-Russian War. The ship was designed to provide air defense and anti-submarine warfare capabilities, and was equipped with a range of missiles, guns, and torpedoes. In 2022, the Moskva was deployed to the Black Sea as part of Russia's naval task force supporting the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAs the conflict escalated, the Moskva became a key target for Ukrainian forces, which were seeking to disrupt Russia's naval operations and weaken its grip on the Black Sea. Ukrainian forces had already sunk several smaller Russian ships, but the Moskva was a much more significant prize, given its size, firepower, and symbolic importance.\n\n#Sinking\n\n##Ukrainian account\n\nAccording to the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, the Moskva was struck by two Neptune anti-ship missiles on the evening of April 13, 2022. The missiles, which were fired from a coastal battery, struck the ship's stern and amidships, causing significant damage and fires. Ukrainian officials claimed that the ship sank several hours later, after attempts to save it had failed.\n\n##Russian account\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense initially denied that the Moskva had sunk, claiming that the ship had been damaged by a fire caused by exploding ammunition. However, as evidence of the sinking emerged, the Russian government was forced to admit that the ship had indeed sunk. Russian officials claimed that the ship had been damaged by a Ukrainian missile, but that the sinking was caused by a combination of factors, including rough seas and a fire on board.\n\n##Other early observations\n\nIn the hours following the sinking, there were conflicting reports about the fate of the Moskva. Some sources claimed that the ship was still afloat, while others reported that it had sunk. The confusion was fueled by the fact that the ship's location was not publicly known, and that there were few eyewitnesses to the sinking.\n\n##Missile strike\n\nThe missile strike that sank the Moskva was a significant military achievement for Ukraine, and marked a major escalation of the conflict. The use of anti-ship missiles against a large warship like the Moskva was a rare occurrence, and demonstrated the capabilities of modern naval warfare.\n\n##Images and video of the sinking ship\n\nIn the days following the sinking, images and video of the Moskva began to emerge, showing the ship listing and burning in the Black Sea. The footage, which was captured by drones and satellites, provided graphic evidence of the sinking and helped to confirm the accounts of Ukrainian and Russian officials.\n\n#Casualties\n\nThe exact number of casualties from the sinking of the Moskva is not known, but it is believed that dozens of Russian sailors were killed or injured. The Russian Ministry of Defense initially reported that one sailor had died, but later acknowledged that there had been a larger number of casualties.\n\n#Impact\n\nThe sinking of the Moskva has significant implications for the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and for the global naval balance of power. The incident has demonstrated the capabilities of modern anti-ship missiles and the vulnerabilities of large warships, and has raised questions about the future of naval warfare.\n\nThe sinking of the Moskva has also had a significant impact on Russia's naval operations in the Black Sea. The loss of the ship's air defense and anti-submarine warfare capabilities has weakened Russia's grip on the region, and has created opportunities for Ukrainian forces to counter-attack.\n\n#Aftermath\n\nIn the aftermath of the sinking, Russia has vowed to continue its naval operations in the Black Sea, despite the loss of the Moskva. Ukrainian forces have continued to target Russian ships and naval installations, and the conflict shows no signs of abating.\n\nThe sinking of the Moskva has also sparked a debate about the capabilities and vulnerabilities of modern naval vessels. The incident has raised questions about the design and construction of warships, and has highlighted the need for improved defenses against anti-ship missiles.\n\n#See also\n\n* 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* Russian Black Sea Fleet\n* Slava-class cruiser\n* Anti-ship missile\n* Naval warfare", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Sinking_of_the_Moskva\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Sinking\n##Ukrainian account\n##Russian account\n##Other early observations\n##Missile strike\n##Images and video of the sinking ship\n#Casualties\n#Impact\n#Aftermath\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Prigozhin's career has been marked by controversy and involvement in various conflicts around the world, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine and military interventions in Africa.\n\n# Early life and education\n\nYevgeny Prigozhin was born on June 1, 1961, in Leningrad, Soviet Union (now Saint Petersburg, Russia). Little is known about his early life, but it is reported that he grew up in a poor family and was involved in petty crime from a young age.\n\n## Criminal history and imprisonment\n\nPrigozhin was arrested and convicted of robbery and assault in 1981, and was sentenced to 12 years in prison. He served 9 years before being released in 1990. During his time in prison, Prigozhin reportedly became acquainted with other high-ranking officials and businessmen, including Igor Sechin, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n# Early career and rise to prominence\n\nAfter his release from prison, Prigozhin began working in the food industry, opening a hot dog stand in Saint Petersburg. He eventually expanded his business to include several restaurants and eventually, a catering company that supplied food to the Russian military.\n\nPrigozhin's catering company, Concord, became a major supplier of food to the Russian military, and he used this connection to build relationships with high-ranking officials, including Putin. In the early 2000s, Prigozhin began to expand his business interests, investing in real estate, construction, and other industries.\n\n# Wagner Group\n\nThe Wagner Group is a private military company founded by Prigozhin in 2014. The group is named after Richard Wagner, a favorite composer of Adolf Hitler, and is reportedly trained by retired Russian military personnel. The Wagner Group has been involved in various conflicts around the world, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine and military interventions in Africa.\n\n## Russian invasion of Ukraine\n\nThe Wagner Group played a significant role in the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2014, providing military support to Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. Prigozhin's involvement in the conflict was widely reported, and he was sanctioned by the United States and European Union for his role in the conflict.\n\n## Conflict with Russian Ministry of Defense\n\nDespite his close ties to the Russian government, Prigozhin has been involved in several high-profile disputes with the Russian Ministry of Defense. In 2018, Prigozhin was reportedly involved in a dispute with Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu over funding for the Wagner Group. The dispute reportedly led to a significant reduction in funding for the group.\n\n## Prigozhin as a populist critic\n\nIn recent years, Prigozhin has positioned himself as a populist critic of the Russian government, criticizing the country's elite for corruption and inefficiency. He has also been critical of the Russian military, accusing them of incompetence and ineffectiveness.\n\n## June 2023 rebellion\n\nIn June 2023, Prigozhin led a rebellion against the Russian government, marching on Moscow with a group of Wagner Group fighters. The rebellion was reportedly sparked by a dispute with the Russian Ministry of Defense, and was widely seen as a challenge to Putin's authority. The rebellion was ultimately put down, and Prigozhin was forced to flee Russia.\n\n# Africa interests\n\nPrigozhin has significant business interests in Africa, where he has invested in mining, construction, and other industries. He has also been involved in several military interventions on the continent, including in the Central African Republic and Sudan.\n\n# Internet Research Agency\n\nThe Internet Research Agency (IRA) is a Russian troll farm founded by Prigozhin in 2013. The IRA has been involved in several high-profile propaganda campaigns, including the 2016 US presidential election. The group has been sanctioned by the United States and European Union for its role in spreading disinformation.\n\n## Spin-offs\n\nThe IRA has spawned several spin-off groups, including the Federal News Agency (FAN) and the Economic News Agency (ENA). These groups have been involved in spreading propaganda and disinformation on behalf of the Russian government.\n\n# International sanctions\n\nPrigozhin has been sanctioned by the United States, European Union, and other countries for his role in various conflicts around the world. He has also been sanctioned for his involvement in spreading disinformation and propaganda.\n\n# U.S. criminal charges\n\nIn 2018, Prigozhin was indicted by the United States Department of Justice for his role in interfering in the 2016 US presidential election. He has also been charged with conspiracy and other crimes related to his involvement in the IRA.\n\n# Financial support for Maria Butina in 2019\n\nIn 2019, it was reported that Prigozhin had provided financial support to Maria Butina, a Russian spy who was convicted of infiltrating the National Rifle Association.\n\n# Personal life\n\nLittle is known about Prigozhin's personal life, but it is reported that he is married with three children. He is known to be a fan of Richard Wagner's music and has been spotted attending performances of Wagner's operas.\n\n# Death\n\nPrigozhin died on August 23, 2023, in a plane crash in Russia. The cause of the crash is unknown, but it is widely speculated that he was assassinated by the Russian government.\n\n# Awards\n\nPrigozhin has received several awards from the Russian government, including the Order of Friendship and the Order of Honor.\n\n# Memorials\n\nA memorial to Prigozhin was erected in Saint Petersburg in 2023. The memorial features a bronze statue of Prigozhin and a plaque honoring his contributions to Russian business and politics.\n\n# See also\n\n* Wagner Group\n* Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* Internet Research Agency\n* Maria Butina\n\n# Notes\n\n* This article is a general overview of Yevgeny Prigozhin's life and career.

Founded in 1979, the company has been instrumental in promoting and developing the Korean tea culture, both domestically and internationally. O'Sulloc Tea is renowned for its high-quality teas, carefully cultivated in the pristine environments of Jeju Island, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The brand offers a diverse range of teas, from traditional Korean tea varieties to contemporary blends, all of which are deeply rooted in the country's rich tea culture.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\nO'Sulloc Tea was established in 1979 by the AmorePacific Group, one of South Korea's largest and most successful conglomerates. The company's name, \"O'Sulloc,\" is derived from the Korean word \"sulloc,\" meaning \"place of tea.\" Since its inception, O'Sulloc Tea has been committed to preserving and promoting the traditional Korean tea culture, while also innovating and adapting to changing consumer preferences. Over the years, the company has expanded its operations to include tea cultivation, processing, and marketing, as well as tea education and tourism.\n\nLocation\n--------\n\nO'Sulloc Tea is based on Jeju Island, a volcanic island located off the southern coast of South Korea. Jeju Island provides an ideal environment for tea cultivation, with its mild climate, rich soil, and ample rainfall. The island's unique geography and climate have created a diverse range of ecosystems, including lush forests, rolling hills, and scenic coastlines. O'Sulloc Tea's tea fields are situated in various locations throughout the island, each with its own distinct characteristics and microclimates.\n\nTea Fields\n----------\n\nO'Sulloc Tea's tea fields are the heart of the company's operations, where high-quality teas are carefully cultivated and harvested. The tea fields are managed using sustainable and organic farming practices, which ensure the long-term health and productivity of the land.\n\n### Soil Composition\n\nThe soil composition of O'Sulloc Tea's tea fields is characterized by a rich mix of minerals and organic matter. The soil is primarily composed of volcanic ash, which provides excellent drainage and aeration for the tea plants. The high concentration of minerals, such as iron and potassium, also contributes to the unique flavor and aroma of O'Sulloc Tea.\n\n### Cultivation Process\n\nO'Sulloc Tea's cultivation process is designed to optimize the quality and flavor of the tea leaves. The tea plants are carefully pruned and trained to promote healthy growth and maximize yields. The company uses a combination of traditional and modern farming techniques, including hand-picking and mechanical harvesting, to ensure that the tea leaves are harvested at the optimal stage of maturity.\n\n### Dolsongi Tea Field\n\nThe Dolsongi Tea Field is one of O'Sulloc Tea's most famous tea fields, located in the southeastern part of Jeju Island. The tea field is situated in a scenic valley surrounded by rolling hills and lush forests. The Dolsongi Tea Field is known for producing some of the company's highest-quality teas, including the award-winning Sejak Tea.\n\n### Seogwang Tea Field\n\nThe Seogwang Tea Field is another prominent tea field operated by O'Sulloc Tea, located in the northwestern part of Jeju Island. The tea field is situated in a coastal area with a unique microclimate, characterized by strong winds and high humidity.

He was a prominent figure in the early 19th century, known for his military conquests, his advocacy for democracy and the common man, and his strong leadership.\n\nEarly life and education\n------------------------\n\nAndrew Jackson was born in Waxhaws, a region on the border of North and South Carolina, to Andrew and Elizabeth Jackson. His father, a Scotch-Irish immigrant, died in 1767, shortly before Andrew's birth. His mother, a devout Christian, raised Andrew and his two brothers with a strong emphasis on education and morality. Jackson received a basic education at local schools, but his formal education ended at the age of 13, when he began working as a clerk in a local store.\n\nRevolutionary War\n-----------------\n\nIn 1780, at the age of 13, Jackson joined the Continental Army as a messenger during the American Revolutionary War. He was captured by British soldiers in 1781 and was imprisoned for several months. After his release, Jackson joined a group of guerrilla fighters and continued to fight against the British.\n\nEarly career\n-------------\n\n### Legal career and marriage\n\nAfter the war, Jackson studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1787. He established a successful law practice in Nashville, Tennessee, and became a prominent figure in the local community. In 1797, Jackson married Rachel Donelson Robards, a divorcee who had been separated from her first husband. The marriage was a significant social event, and Jackson's love for Rachel endured throughout his life.\n\n### Early public career\n\nJackson's entry into politics began in 1796, when he was elected to the Tennessee state legislature. He served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1796 to 1797 and in the U.S. Senate from 1797 to 1798. Jackson's early public career was marked by his advocacy for states' rights and his opposition to the Alien and Sedition Acts.\n\n### Planting career and slavery\n\nIn the late 1790s, Jackson began to develop a plantation at The Hermitage, near Nashville. He grew cotton, tobacco, and other crops, and became a successful planter. However, Jackson's plantation relied heavily on slave labor, and he became a slave owner. Throughout his life, Jackson owned over 150 slaves, and his views on slavery were shaped by his experiences as a planter.\n\n### Duel with Dickinson and adventure with Burr\n\nIn 1806, Jackson engaged in a duel with Charles Dickinson, a rival who had insulted Jackson's wife. Jackson killed Dickinson, but was himself wounded. In 1807, Jackson became embroiled in a plot by Aaron Burr, the former Vice President, to establish an independent republic in the Southwest. Jackson's involvement in the plot ultimately led to his indictment for treason, but he was acquitted in 1807.\n\nMilitary career\n----------------\n\n### War of 1812\n\nDuring the War of 1812, Jackson served as a major general in the Tennessee militia. He led a successful campaign against the Creek Nation, a Native American tribe allied with the British. Jackson's victory at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend in 1814 earned him national recognition.\n\n#### Battle of New Orleans\n\nIn January 1815, Jackson led a small force of American troops against a large British army at the Battle of New Orleans. Jackson's victory was a significant turning point in the war, and it cemented his reputation as a military leader.\n\n### First Seminole War\n\nIn 1817, Jackson led a military campaign against the Seminole Nation, a Native American tribe that had been raiding American settlements. Jackson's campaign was marked by controversy, as he executed two British subjects who had been accused of inciting the Seminoles. The incident damaged Jackson's reputation, but it also contributed to his popularity among many Americans.\n\nPresidential aspirations\n-----------------------\n\n### Election of 1824\n\nIn 1824, Jackson ran for President, but lost to John Quincy Adams in a contested election. Jackson's supporters claimed that Adams had stolen the election, and the controversy surrounding the election contributed to Jackson's popularity.\n\n### Election of 1828 and death of Rachel Jackson\n\nIn 1828, Jackson ran again for President, and this time he won a decisive victory. However, his wife Rachel died just before his inauguration, and Jackson was devastated by her loss.\n\nPresidency (1829–1837)\n------------------------\n\n### Inauguration\n\nJackson's inauguration was a significant event, as it marked the first time that a President had been elected by a broad coalition of voters. Jackson's inaugural address emphasized his commitment to democracy and the common man.\n\n### Reforms and rotation in office\n\nJackson implemented several reforms during his presidency, including the Spoils System, which allowed him to replace government officials with his own supporters. He also implemented a policy of rotation in office, which limited the amount of time that government officials could serve.\n\n### Petticoat affair\n\nIn 1831, Jackson became embroiled in a scandal involving his Secretary of War, John Eaton, and his wife Peggy. The scandal, known as the Petticoat affair, damaged Jackson's reputation and led to the resignation of several of his cabinet members.\n\n### Indian Removal Act\n\nIn 1830, Jackson signed the Indian Removal Act, which allowed the federal government to forcibly remove Native American tribes from their lands. The act led to the Trail of Tears, a brutal and devastating forced march of thousands of Cherokee Indians.\n\n### Nullification crisis\n\nIn 1832, Jackson faced a crisis when the state of South Carolina nullified a federal tariff. Jackson responded by issuing a proclamation that asserted the authority of the federal government, and he ultimately prevailed in the crisis.\n\n### Bank War and Election of 1832\n\n#### Bank veto\n\nIn 1832, Jackson vetoed a bill that would have re-chartered the Second Bank of the United States. The veto was a significant blow to the bank, and it marked a turning point in the Bank War.\n\n#### Election of 1832\n\nIn 1832, Jackson ran for re-election, and he won a decisive victory. The election was marked by controversy, as Jackson's opponents accused him of abusing his power.\n\n#### Removal of deposits and censure\n\nIn 1833, Jackson ordered the removal of government deposits from the Second Bank of the United States. The move was a significant blow to the bank, and it led to a censure of Jackson by the Senate.\n\n#### Panic of 1837\n\nIn 1837, the United States experienced a severe economic downturn, known as the Panic of 1837. The panic was caused in part by Jackson's policies, and it damaged his reputation.\n\nPhysical assault and assassination attempt\n----------------------------------------\n\nIn 1835, Jackson was the target of an assassination attempt by a man named Richard Lawrence. The attempt failed, but it marked a turning point in Jackson's life.\n\nSlavery\n--------\n\nJackson's views on slavery were shaped by his experiences as a planter. He owned over 150 slaves, and he believed that slavery was a necessary institution. However, Jackson also believed that slavery was a moral evil, and he hoped that it would eventually be abolished.\n\nForeign affairs\n----------------\n\nDuring his presidency, Jackson pursued a policy of expansionism, and he was involved in several foreign policy crises. He also oversaw the annexation of Texas, which became a state in 1845.\n\nJudiciary\n----------\n\nJackson's views on the judiciary were shaped by his experiences as a lawyer and a politician. He believed that the judiciary should be subservient to the executive branch, and he clashed with the Supreme Court on several occasions.\n\nStates admitted to the Union\n-----------------------------\n\nDuring Jackson's presidency, two states were admitted to the Union: Arkansas and Michigan.\n\nLater life and death (1837–1845)\n------------------------------\n\nAfter leaving office, Jackson returned to The Hermitage, where he lived until his death in 1845. Jackson's later life was marked by controversy, as he became embroiled in several scandals and lawsuits.\n\nPersonal life\n-------------\n\n### Family\n\nJackson's family life was marked by tragedy, as he lost his wife Rachel just before his inauguration. He also lost several of his children, and he was known to be a devoted father and husband.\n\n### Temperament\n\nJackson's temperament was marked by his strong will and his fierce determination. He was known to be a fierce fighter, and he was involved in several duels and brawls throughout his life.\n\n### Religious faith\n\nJackson's religious faith was shaped by his Presbyterian upbringing. He was a devout Christian, and he believed in the importance of faith in public life.\n\nLegacy\n--------\n\nJackson's legacy is complex and multifaceted. He is remembered as a strong leader and a fierce defender of democracy. However, he is also remembered for his flaws, including his views on slavery and his treatment of Native Americans.\n\nWritings\n--------\n\nJackson wrote several books and articles throughout his life, including his memoirs, which were published posthumously.\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nThis article is based on a variety of sources, including biographies, books, and primary sources.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nThis article does not include any citations or references.\n\nBibliography\n------------\n\n### Biographies\n\n* Remini, Robert V.

The outbreak produced numerous tornadoes, causing widespread damage and loss of life. This article provides an overview of the meteorological conditions that led to the outbreak, the confirmed tornadoes, non-tornadic impacts, and the aftermath of the event.\n\n#Meteorological synopsis\n\nA complex weather pattern developed over the eastern United States in early April 2022, leading to a prolonged period of severe thunderstorms and tornadoes. A strong low-pressure system developed over the southern Great Plains, interacting with a potent cold front and a strong jet stream.\n\n##April 4–5\n\nOn April 4, a strong cold front pushed eastward across the southern United States, interacting with a warm and humid air mass from the Gulf of Mexico. This led to the development of a strong squall line, producing severe thunderstorms and tornadoes across parts of Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. As the system moved eastward, it encountered a strong jet stream, leading to an increase in instability and wind shear.\n\n##April 6–7\n\nBy April 6, the low-pressure system had intensified, and the cold front had pushed into the eastern United States. A strong upper-level trough developed over the Appalachian Mountains, providing additional lift and instability. This led to the development of a new round of severe thunderstorms and tornadoes across parts of Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina. The system continued to move eastward, producing additional tornadoes and severe weather on April 7.\n\n#Confirmed tornadoes\n\nA total of 73 tornadoes were confirmed across the eastern United States during the outbreak sequence.\n\n##April 4 event\n\nA total of 15 tornadoes were confirmed on April 4, with the majority of them occurring in Texas and Louisiana.\n\n##April 5 event\n\nA total of 20 tornadoes were confirmed on April 5, with the majority of them occurring in Mississippi and Alabama.\n\n##April 6 event\n\nA total of 25 tornadoes were confirmed on April 6, with the majority of them occurring in Georgia and South Carolina.\n\n##April 7 event\n\nA total of 13 tornadoes were confirmed on April 7, with the majority of them occurring in North Carolina and Virginia.\n\n##Pembroke–Ellabell–Black Creek, Georgia\n\nOne of the most significant tornadoes of the outbreak occurred on April 6 in Pembroke, Ellabell, and Black Creek, Georgia. The tornado was rated EF3, with estimated winds of up to 160 mph. The tornado caused significant damage and loss of life, with a total of 10 fatalities reported.\n\n#Non-tornadic impacts\n\nIn addition to the tornadoes, the outbreak sequence also produced significant non-tornadic impacts, including:\n\n* Heavy rainfall: Widespread heavy rainfall occurred across the eastern United States, leading to flash flooding and significant disruptions to transportation.\n* Strong winds: Strong winds occurred across the region, leading to power outages and significant damage to trees and structures.\n* Hail: Significant hail occurred in some areas, leading to damage to crops and vehicles.\n\n#Aftermath\n\nThe aftermath of the outbreak sequence was significant, with widespread damage and loss of life reported. Emergency responders and aid organizations worked to provide assistance to affected areas, and a state of emergency was declared in several states.\n\n#See also\n\n* List of tornado outbreaks\n* List of tornadoes in the United States\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is a factual summary of the tornado outbreak sequence of April 4–7, 2022.

{"title": "Malahai", "content": "#Etymology\n#Design and materials\n#In Russia\n#See also\n#Explanatory notes\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Malahai\n\nA malahai is a type of traditional Tatar and Bashkir clothing, specifically a long, woolen coat with a distinctive design and intricate embroidery. It has been an integral part of the cultural heritage of the Tatar and Bashkir peoples for centuries, symbolizing their rich history, traditions, and identity.\n\n# Etymology\n\nThe word \"malahai\" is derived from the Tatar language, with possible roots in the Turkic languages. In Tatar, \"malahai\" means \"long coat\" or \" outerwear\", which accurately describes the garment's design and purpose. Over time, the term has become synonymous with traditional Tatar and Bashkir clothing, evoking images of intricate patterns, vibrant colors, and skilled craftsmanship.\n\n# Design and materials\n\nMalahai coats are characterized by their long, flowing design, typically reaching down to the ankles. They are made from thick, high-quality wool, often obtained from local sheep breeds, which provides excellent insulation against the harsh Siberian winters. The coats are usually fastened with a row of buttons or a belt, and may feature a high collar to protect the wearer's neck from the cold.\n\nThe malahai's most distinctive feature, however, is its intricate embroidery, which adorns the coat's hem, sleeves, and chest. The patterns and motifs used in malahai embroidery are deeply rooted in Tatar and Bashkir culture, and often feature geometric shapes, floral patterns, and animal designs. The embroidery is typically done by hand, using silk or wool threads in a variety of colors, and can take several weeks or even months to complete.\n\n# In Russia\n\nThe malahai has a long and storied history in Russia, dating back to the Middle Ages. During the Golden Horde period, Tatar and Bashkir warriors wore malahai coats as a symbol of their status and prestige. Later, during the Russian Empire, the malahai became a popular fashion item among the nobility, who admired its elegance and craftsmanship.\n\nToday, the malahai remains an important part of Russian cultural heritage, with many museums and cultural institutions featuring exhibits on its history and significance. In Tatarstan and Bashkortostan, the malahai is still worn on special occasions, such as weddings and holidays, and is often passed down from generation to generation as a family heirloom.\n\n## Modern production\n\nIn recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in traditional Tatar and Bashkir clothing, including the malahai. Many fashion designers and textile artists are now creating modern interpretations of the malahai, using traditional techniques and materials to create unique and stylish garments.\n\nIn addition, several companies and cooperatives in Tatarstan and Bashkortostan are producing high-quality malahai coats using traditional methods and materials. These coats are highly prized by collectors and enthusiasts, and are often sold at premium prices due to their rarity and craftsmanship.\n\n## Cultural significance\n\nThe malahai holds a special place in Tatar and Bashkir culture, symbolizing the community's rich history, traditions, and identity. It is often worn on special occasions, such as weddings and holidays, and is considered a symbol of respect and prestige.\n\nIn addition, the malahai has played an important role in the preservation of Tatar and Bashkir cultural heritage, particularly during the Soviet era when many traditional practices and customs were suppressed. Today, the malahai is recognized as an important part of Russia's cultural heritage, and is celebrated as a symbol of the country's rich diversity and cultural traditions.\n\n# See also\n\n* Tatar clothing\n* Bashkir clothing\n* Traditional Russian clothing\n* Embroidery\n* Textile art\n\n# Explanatory notes\n\nThis article provides an overview of the malahai, a traditional Tatar and Bashkir coat with a rich history and cultural significance.

With a career spanning over four decades, Gottfried has become a household name, entertaining audiences with his unique blend of wit, sarcasm, and irreverence.\n\nEarly Life\n-----------\n\nGilbert Gottfried was born on February 28, 1955, in Brooklyn, New York, to Lillian (Zimmerman) and Max Gottfried.

However, Gottfried has always maintained that his comedy is meant to be satirical and subversive, pushing boundaries and challenging societal norms.\n\n### Controversies\n\nThroughout his career, Gottfried has been involved in several controversies, including a infamous incident at the 1991 Friars Club roast of Hugh Hefner, where he made a series of off-color jokes that were deemed too racy for the audience. In 2011, Gottfried was fired from his voice-over work for Aflac after he made a series of jokes about the Japanese earthquake on Twitter.\n\nPersonal Life\n-------------\n\nGottfried has been married to Dara Kravitz since 2007, and the couple has two children together. He is a self-proclaimed \"animal lover\" and has been involved in various animal welfare organizations throughout his career.\n\nDeath\n-----\n\nGilbert Gottfried passed away on April 12, 2022, at the age of 67, after a long battle with a heart condition.\n\nLegacy\n-------\n\nGottfried's impact on comedy is undeniable. He has influenced a generation of comedians, including Sarah Silverman, Louis C.K., and Amy Schumer. His unapologetic style and willingness to push boundaries have paved the way for a new wave of comedians who are not afraid to take risks and challenge societal norms.\n\nFilmography\n------------\n\n### Television\n\n* \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\" (1980s)\n* \"Late Night with David Letterman\" (1980s)\n* \"Saturday Night Live\" (1980s)\n* \"The Simpsons\" (1990s)\n* \"Family Guy\" (2000s)\n* \"The View\" (2000s)\n* \"The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon\" (2010s)\n\n### Video Games\n\n* \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\" (2004)\n* \"Fallout 3\" (2008)\n* \"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3\" (2011)\n\n### Web\n\n* \"The Gilbert Gottfried Podcast\" (2014-present)\n\n### Commercials\n\n* Aflac (2000s)\n* McDonald's (2000s)\n* Subway (2010s)\n\nDiscography\n------------\n\n### Featured Recordings\n\n* \"Dirty Jokes\" (1988)\n* \"Dirty Jokes: Volume 2\" (1990)\n* \" Dirty Jokes: Volume 3\" (1992)\n* \" Gilbert Gottfried: Dirty Jokes\" (1998)\n* \"Dirty Jokes: Volume 4\" (2000)\n* \" Dirty Jokes: Volume 5\" (2002)\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nExternal Links\n---------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Gilbert_Gottfried\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n#Career\n##Podcast\n#Artistry and image\n##Controversies\n#Personal life\n#Death\n#Legacy\n#Filmography\n##Television\n##Video games\n##Web\n##Commercials\n#Discography\n##Featured recordings\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The republic was formed after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and was characterized by its complex relationships with both Ukraine and Russia.\n\n## #Crimean ASSR\n\nThe Crimean Peninsula has a long and complex history, with various empires and states vying for control over the region. In 1921, the Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (ASSR) was established within the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR). The Crimean ASSR was an autonomous region within the RSFSR, with its own government and a degree of self-governance. However, the region's autonomy was limited, and it was ultimately subject to the authority of the RSFSR.\n\n## #Name change in 1992\n\nIn 1991, the Soviet Union was dissolved, and Ukraine declared its independence. The Crimean ASSR was inherited by Ukraine and became the Crimean Autonomous Republic within Ukraine. However, in 1992, the Crimean parliament voted to change the region's name to the Republic of Crimea. This move was seen as a challenge to Ukraine's authority and sparked tensions between the two governments.\n\n## #Relations with Ukraine\n\nThe relationship between the Republic of Crimea and Ukraine was complex and often tense. Ukraine viewed the Republic of Crimea as a rebellious region that was seeking to undermine its authority. In response, Ukraine imposed economic sanctions on the region and attempted to limit its autonomy. The Republic of Crimea, on the other hand, saw itself as a sovereign state that was entitled to self-governance and economic independence.\n\nIn 1992, the Ukrainian government attempted to dissolve the Crimean parliament and impose direct rule over the region. However, this move was met with resistance from the Crimean government, which declared that it would not recognize the Ukrainian government's authority. The standoff between the two governments continued for several months, with neither side willing to back down.\n\n## #Relations with Russia\n\nThe Republic of Crimea also had close ties with Russia, which had historically claimed the region as part of its territory. In 1992, the Russian government recognized the Republic of Crimea as a sovereign state, which further strained relations with Ukraine. Russia also provided economic and military aid to the Republic of Crimea, which helped to sustain the region's economy and military.\n\nHowever, Russia's support for the Republic of Crimea was not without its limitations. Russia was also seeking to establish good relations with Ukraine, which it saw as an important partner in the region. As a result, Russia walked a fine line between supporting the Republic of Crimea and avoiding conflict with Ukraine.\n\n## #Name change in 1995\n\nIn 1995, the Ukrainian government and the Republic of Crimea reached a compromise on the region's status. The Republic of Crimea agreed to drop its claim to sovereignty and become the Autonomous Republic of Crimea within Ukraine. In return, Ukraine agreed to grant the region greater autonomy and economic powers.\n\nThe compromise marked the end of the Republic of Crimea as a sovereign state. However, the region's autonomy and economic powers were significantly increased, which helped to address some of the grievances that had driven the region's separatist movement.\n\n## #See also\n\n* Crimean Peninsula\n* Autonomous Republic of Crimea\n* Ukraine\n* Russia\n\n## #Notes\n\nThe Republic of Crimea was a short-lived but significant entity in the region's history. Its existence highlighted the complex relationships between Ukraine, Russia, and the Crimean Peninsula, which continue to be a source of tension to this day.\n\n## #References\n\nNone\n\n## #Sources\n\nNone", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Republic_of_Crimea_(1992–1995)\" following this outline:\n\n#Crimean ASSR\n#Name change in 1992\n#Relations with Ukraine\n#Relations with Russia\n#Name change in 1995\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Sources\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The film is based on the true story of Tim Ballard, a former CIA operative who founded the anti-human trafficking organization Operation Underground Railroad.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe film tells the story of Tim Ballard (played by Jim Caviezel), a former CIA operative who becomes increasingly disillusioned with the government's lack of action against human trafficking. After a chance encounter with a young survivor of human trafficking, Ballard becomes obsessed with rescuing victims and bringing perpetrators to justice. He quits his job at the CIA and founds Operation Underground Railroad, a non-profit organization dedicated to fighting human trafficking.\n\nAs Ballard delves deeper into the world of human trafficking, he faces opposition from government agencies, law enforcement, and even his own family. Despite the risks, he continues to work tirelessly to rescue victims and gather evidence to bring traffickers to justice. The film follows Ballard's journey from his early days as a CIA operative to his current work as the founder of Operation Underground Railroad.\n\n# Cast\n\n* Jim Caviezel as Tim Ballard\n* Mira Sorvino as Katherine Ballard\n* Bill Camp as Tom Phillips\n* José Zúñiga as Javier Peña\n* Gerardo Taracena as Rafael\n* Eduardo Verástegui as Paul\n\n# Production\n\n## Development\n\nThe film was first announced in 2016, with Alejandro Monteverde set to direct and Jim Caviezel attached to star as Tim Ballard. The script was written by Monteverde and Rodney Romero, with input from Ballard himself. The film was produced by Eduardo Verástegui, who also appears in a supporting role.\n\n## Filming\n\nPrincipal photography took place in Mexico and the United States, with filming locations including Mexico City, Tijuana, and Los Angeles. The film's cinematography was handled by Rodrigo Prieto, who has worked on a number of high-profile films including \"The Martian\" and \"The Revenant\".\n\n## Distribution\n\nThe film was distributed by Angel Studios, a Utah-based production company and distributor. Angel Studios specializes in faith-based and family-friendly content, and has released a number of successful films and television shows in recent years.\n\n## Accuracy\n\nThe film is based on the true story of Tim Ballard and his work with Operation Underground Railroad. However, some artistic liberties were taken to enhance the storytelling and drama. Ballard himself was involved in the production of the film and ensured that the events depicted were as accurate as possible.\n\n# Connections to QAnon conspiracy theories\n\nThe film has been linked to QAnon conspiracy theories, with some proponents of the theory claiming that the film is part of a larger effort to expose human trafficking and pedophilia. However, there is no concrete evidence to support this claim, and the film's producers and director have denied any connection to QAnon.\n\n# Pay-it-forward scheme\n\nThe film's producers launched a pay-it-forward scheme, which allowed viewers to purchase tickets for others to see the film for free. The scheme was designed to encourage people to see the film and to raise awareness about human trafficking.\n\n# Reception\n\n## Critical response\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising its powerful storyline and performances, while others criticized its heavy-handed approach and lack of subtlety. The film holds a 40% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 4.5/10.\n\n## Box office\n\nThe film was a moderate box office success, grossing over $10 million worldwide on a budget of $5 million. The film performed well in its opening weekend, but its box office takings declined sharply in subsequent weeks.\n\n## Audience reception and faith-based appeal\n\nThe film was well-received by faith-based audiences, who appreciated its strong Christian themes and messages. The film's portrayal of Tim Ballard's faith and his reliance on God was seen as authentic and inspiring by many viewers.\n\n## Endorsements and special screening\n\nThe film was endorsed by a number of high-profile figures, including former President Donald Trump and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. The film was also screened at a number of special events, including a screening at the White House.\n\n## Accolades\n\nThe film won a number of awards, including the Grand Prize at the 2019 Dallas Film Festival and the Audience Award at the 2020 Santa Barbara International Film Festival.\n\n# References\n\n# External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Sound_of_Freedom_(film)\" following this outline:\n\n#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production\n##Development\n##Filming\n##Distribution\n##Accuracy\n#Connections to QAnon conspiracy theories\n#Pay-it-forward scheme\n#Reception\n##Critical response\n##Box office\n##Audience reception and faith-based appeal\n##Endorsements and special screening\n##Accolades\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The season also saw the introduction of several rule changes, including the introduction of a \"sin bin\" system for players who commit certain types of fouls.\n\n# Coach Appointments\n\nPrior to the start of the season, several clubs made changes to their coaching staff.
