The earthquake, which had a magnitude of 5.6 on the Richter scale, was centered in the Cianjur Regency, approximately 70 kilometers southeast of the provincial capital, Bandung.\n\n# Tectonic Setting\n\nIndonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, an area of high volcanic and seismic activity that encircles the Pacific Ocean. The country is situated at the boundary between the Eurasian, Australian, and Philippine Sea tectonic plates. The interaction between these plates has resulted in the formation of numerous fault lines, including the Sunda Megathrust, which runs along the southern coast of Java.\n\nThe Sunda Megathrust is a 5,000 km-long fault line that forms the boundary between the Eurasian and Australian plates. The fault line is characterized by a zone of intense seismic activity, with numerous earthquakes occurring along its length. The 2022 West Java earthquake is believed to have occurred on a previously unknown fault line, which is thought to be a splay of the Sunda Megathrust.\n\n# Earthquake\n\nThe earthquake occurred at 1:21 pm local time on November 21, 2022. It had a magnitude of 5.6 on the Richter scale, with a focal depth of approximately 10 km. The earthquake was classified as a shallow earthquake, which is characterized by a focal depth of less than 20 km. Shallow earthquakes are typically more destructive than deep earthquakes, as the energy released is closer to the surface.\n\nThe earthquake was felt throughout the province of West Java, with reports of damage and casualties coming from several regencies. The earthquake was also felt in the neighboring provinces of Central Java and Jakarta.\n\n# Impact\n\nThe earthquake had a significant impact on the affected areas, with widespread damage reported to buildings, roads, and other infrastructure. The earthquake triggered landslides and soil liquefaction, which blocked roads and made it difficult for rescue teams to access affected areas.\n\nThe earthquake also affected the local economy, with several businesses and industries reporting losses. The agricultural sector was particularly affected, with reports of crop damage and livestock losses.\n\n## Casualties\n\nThe earthquake resulted in a significant loss of life, with the official death toll standing at 615. Over 7,000 people were injured, with many more displaced from their homes.\n\nThe majority of the casualties were reported from the Cianjur Regency, where the earthquake was centered. The regency's capital, Cianjur, was particularly affected, with reports of widespread damage and loss of life.\n\n## Search and Rescue\n\nSearch and rescue efforts were launched immediately after the earthquake, with teams from the Indonesian National Search and Rescue Agency (BNPB) and local authorities working to locate and evacuate those trapped.\n\nThe search and rescue efforts were hampered by the remote location of the affected areas and the lack of access to some areas due to landslides and damaged roads. The efforts were also affected by the lack of resources and equipment, with some teams reporting a shortage of personnel and equipment.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe aftermath of the earthquake was marked by a significant humanitarian response, with aid pouring in from local and international organizations.\n\n## Reconstruction\n\nReconstruction efforts began soon after the earthquake, with the government announcing plans to rebuild damaged homes and infrastructure. The government also announced plans to provide financial assistance to those affected by the earthquake.\n\nThe reconstruction efforts were hampered by the lack of resources and funding, with some organizations reporting a shortage of materials and equipment. The efforts were also affected by the remote location of the affected areas, which made it difficult to access some areas.\n\n# Response\n\nThe response to the earthquake was led by the Indonesian government, with the BNPB playing a key role in coordinating the relief efforts.\n\n## International Aid\n\nInternational aid poured in following the earthquake, with several countries and organizations providing financial and material assistance.\n\nThe United States, Australia, and Japan were among the countries that provided aid, with the United States providing $1 million in financial assistance. The United Nations also provided aid, with the organization's resident coordinator in Indonesia announcing a $10 million appeal for humanitarian assistance.\n\n# Controversy\n\nThe response to the earthquake was not without controversy, with some organizations and individuals criticizing the government's response.\n\nSome organizations criticized the government for its slow response to the disaster, with some reporting that aid took days to reach affected areas. Others criticized the government for its lack of preparedness, with some reporting that the country's disaster management systems were inadequate.\n\n# See Also\n\n* List of earthquakes in Indonesia\n* 2006 Yogyakarta earthquake\n* 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a factual account of the 2022 West Java earthquake and its aftermath.

The 15th named storm of the annual Pacific typhoon season, Megi caused significant damage and loss of life in both countries.\n\n# Meteorological history\n\n## Formation and intensification\n\nMegi formed on April 13, 2010, from a low-pressure area that developed east of the Philippines. The system slowly intensified into a tropical depression, and was named Megi by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) on April 15. The storm then intensified into a tropical storm, as the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert. Megi continued to strengthen, reaching its peak intensity on April 17, with maximum sustained winds of 165 km/h (105 mph) and a central pressure of 970 hPa (28.64 inHg).\n\n## Landfall and dissipation\n\nMegi made landfall in the Philippines on April 18, specifically in the province of Isabela. The storm caused widespread damage and flooding, particularly in the northeastern part of the country. After crossing the Philippines, Megi re-emerged into the South China Sea and continued to move northwestwards. On April 23, Megi made landfall in China's Guangdong province, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall. The storm then dissipated on April 24, over the province of Guangxi.\n\n# Preparations\n\n## Philippines\n\nIn preparation for Megi's landfall, the Philippine government placed several provinces under storm signal number 3, indicating winds of up to 100 km/h (62 mph). The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) activated its emergency operations center and deployed response teams to affected areas. The Philippine Red Cross also mobilized its volunteers and equipment to assist in relief efforts.\n\n## China\n\nChinese authorities issued a yellow alert for Megi, indicating a moderate level of severity. The Guangdong provincial government evacuated over 100,000 people from low-lying areas and deployed emergency response teams to affected regions. The Guangzhou city government also suspended classes and work in preparation for the storm.\n\n# Impact\n\n## Philippines\n\nMegi caused significant damage and loss of life in the Philippines. According to the NDRRMC, the storm affected over 100,000 people, with 23 reported deaths and 164 injuries. The storm also caused widespread flooding, particularly in the provinces of Isabela and Cagayan. The Philippine Department of Agriculture estimated that the storm damaged over 10,000 hectares of agricultural land, resulting in losses of over PHP 1 billion (USD 22 million).\n\n## China\n\nIn China, Megi caused widespread damage and disruption, particularly in the provinces of Guangdong and Guangxi. According to the Guangdong provincial government, the storm affected over 1 million people, with 1 reported death and 15 injuries. The storm also caused significant economic losses, with estimated damages of over CNY 1 billion (USD 145 million).\n\n# Aftermath\n\n## Philippines\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, the Philippine government provided relief assistance to affected areas. The NDRRMC distributed food, shelter, and other essential supplies to affected communities. The Philippine Red Cross also provided medical assistance and psychological support to affected individuals.\n\n## China\n\nIn China, the government provided relief assistance to affected areas, including food, shelter, and medical aid. The Guangdong provincial government also provided financial assistance to affected individuals and families. The storm also prompted the Chinese government to review and improve its disaster preparedness and response measures.\n\n# Retirement\n\nThe name Megi was retired from the list of tropical cyclone names by the JMA in 2011, due to the significant damage and loss of life caused by the storm.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of tropical cyclones\n* Pacific typhoon season\n* Tropical cyclones in the Philippines\n* Tropical cyclones in China\n\n# External links\n\n* Japan Meteorological Agency\n* Joint Typhoon Warning Center\n* National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (Philippines)\n* Guangdong provincial government (China)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Tropical_Storm_Megi\" following this outline:\n\n#Meteorological history\n#Preparations\n#Impact\n#Aftermath\n#Retirement\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Fuzzball_(string_theory)", "content": "#Physical properties\n##String theory and composition\n##Densities\n##Neutron star collapse\n#Information paradox\n#Testability of the theory\n#References\n#External links\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Fuzzball (String Theory)\n\nIn string theory, a fuzzball is a theoretical concept that attempts to reconcile the principles of general relativity and quantum mechanics. It is a hypothetical, grainy, and indistinct object that is thought to be the fundamental building block of black holes and other compact objects. The fuzzball proposal is an alternative to the traditional notion of a black hole as a smooth, continuous spacetime with a singularity at its center.\n\n**Physical Properties**\n\nThe physical properties of fuzzballs are a subject of ongoing research and debate in the field of string theory.\n\n## String Theory and Composition\n\nIn string theory, a fuzzball is composed of a large number of strings that are highly excited and densely packed. These strings vibrate at different frequencies, giving rise to the various particles we observe in the universe. The strings are thought to be the fundamental units of matter and energy, and their vibrations determine the properties of the particles they create. Fuzzballs are formed when a large number of strings are compressed into a small region of space, creating a highly dense and energetic object.\n\nThe composition of a fuzzball is thought to be made up of a variety of strings, including open strings, closed strings, and D-branes. Open strings have free ends that can attach to D-branes, which are higher-dimensional objects that interact with the strings. Closed strings, on the other hand, have no free ends and can vibrate freely. The interactions between these different types of strings give rise to the complex structure of a fuzzball.\n\n## Densities\n\nFuzzballs are characterized by their high density, which is thought to be many orders of magnitude greater than that of a neutron star. The density of a fuzzball is determined by the number of strings it contains, as well as their energy and vibration modes. The density of a fuzzball is typically measured in terms of the Planck density, which is a unit of density that is derived from the fundamental constants of nature.\n\nThe high density of a fuzzball gives rise to a number of interesting effects, including the creation of a large number of particles and antiparticles through a process known as pair production. This process occurs when the energy density of the fuzzball is sufficient to create particle-antiparticle pairs from the vacuum.\n\n## Neutron Star Collapse\n\nFuzzballs are thought to be the end product of the collapse of a neutron star. When a neutron star collapses, its density increases to the point where the strings that make up the star become highly excited and densely packed. This creates a fuzzball, which is a stable, long-lived object that can persist for billions of years.\n\nThe collapse of a neutron star into a fuzzball is thought to occur through a process known as the \"fuzzball transition.\" This transition occurs when the density of the neutron star reaches a critical value, at which point the strings that make up the star become highly excited and begin to interact with each other in a complex way.\n\n**Information Paradox**\n\nThe fuzzball proposal is also relevant to the black hole information paradox, which is a long-standing problem in theoretical physics. The paradox arises because the laws of quantum mechanics suggest that information cannot be destroyed, but the laws of general relativity suggest that anything that falls into a black hole is lost forever.\n\nThe fuzzball proposal resolves this paradox by suggesting that the information that falls into a black hole is not lost, but rather preserved in the form of a fuzzball. The fuzzball is thought to be a highly complex and structured object that contains a vast amount of information, including the information that fell into the black hole.\n\n**Testability of the Theory**\n\nThe fuzzball proposal is a theoretical concept that is difficult to test directly. However, there are a number of indirect ways to test the theory, including the observation of high-energy particle collisions and the study of the properties of black holes.\n\nOne of the key challenges in testing the fuzzball proposal is the development of a complete and consistent theory of quantum gravity. This theory would provide a framework for understanding the behavior of particles and fields at very small distances and high energies, and would allow for the prediction of the properties of fuzzballs.\n\n**References**\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)\n\n**External Links**\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Fuzzball_(string_theory)\" following this outline:\n\n#Physical properties\n##String theory and composition\n##Densities\n##Neutron star collapse\n#Information paradox\n#Testability of the theory\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The election was the third since the country's return to democracy in 2014 and the second under the 2013 Constitution.\n\n#Background\n\nFiji has a history of electoral instability, with the country experiencing four coups since 1987. The 2013 Constitution, which was introduced after the 2006 coup, established a proportional representation system and enshrined the principles of democracy and human rights. The 2014 and 2018 elections were widely regarded as free and fair, with the FijiFirst party, led by Frank Bainimarama, winning both elections.\n\nIn the lead-up to the 2022 election, there were concerns about the country's electoral laws, which some critics argued favored the incumbent government. The Electoral Commission, which is responsible for conducting the election, faced criticism for its handling of the voter registration process and the allocation of election funds.\n\n#Electoral system\n\n##Voters\n\nAll Fijian citizens aged 18 and over, regardless of their place of residence, are eligible to vote. The country has a total of 693,915 registered voters, with 43,793 new voters added to the roll since the 2018 election. The Electoral Commission reported that 99% of eligible voters were registered to vote.\n\n##Electoral changes\n\nThe 2022 election saw several changes to the electoral system. The Electoral Commission introduced a new voter registration system, which allowed voters to register online. The Commission also increased the number of polling stations and introduced a new system for counting votes.\n\nThe election was contested by seven parties, with a total of 342 candidates. The parties were required to submit their candidate lists to the Electoral Commission by 11 November 2022.\n\n#Schedule\n\nThe election was scheduled to take place on 14 December 2022, with polling stations opening at 7:30 am and closing at 6:00 pm.

He has been at the forefront of climbing for over two decades, pushing the limits of what is possible and inspiring a generation of climbers.\n\nEarly Life\n-----------\n\nChris Sharma was born on April 23, 1981, in Santa Cruz, California. Growing up in a family of outdoor enthusiasts, Sharma was introduced to climbing at a young age. His parents, Bob and Gita Sharma, were both avid hikers and climbers, and they encouraged Chris and his sister, Jenny, to explore the outdoors from an early age.\n\nSharma's interest in climbing began when he was just 12 years old. He started climbing with his family and friends at the local climbing gym in Santa Cruz. As he progressed, Sharma became increasingly fascinated with the sport, spending every spare moment he had climbing, training, and studying the techniques of other climbers.\n\nClimbing Career\n----------------\n\n### 1996–2002 (to Realization)\n\nSharma's competitive climbing career began in 1996, when he won the Junior National Climbing Championships in the United States. This victory marked the beginning of a successful competitive career, during which Sharma won numerous national and international competitions.\n\nIn 2000, Sharma made his first ascent of \"Realization,\" a notoriously difficult route in the Ceüse region of France. This achievement marked a significant milestone in Sharma's career, as it established him as one of the world's top climbers.\n\n### 2002–2008 (to Jumbo Love)\n\nOver the next several years, Sharma continued to push the limits of what was possible in climbing. In 2002, he made the first ascent of \"Biographie,\" a highly technical route in the Verdon Gorge of France. This achievement cemented Sharma's reputation as a master of technical climbing.\n\nIn 2008, Sharma made the first ascent of \"Jumbo Love,\" a massive, 250-foot route in the Clark Mountain Range of California. This achievement marked a new level of difficulty in climbing, as it required Sharma to climb a seemingly impossible sequence of moves.\n\n### 2008–2013 (to La Dura Dura)\n\nDuring this period, Sharma continued to explore new climbing destinations and push the limits of what was possible. In 2010, he made the first ascent of \"Golpe de Estado,\" a highly technical route in the Oliana region of Spain.\n\nIn 2013, Sharma made the first ascent of \"La Dura Dura,\" a notoriously difficult route in the Oliana region of Spain. This achievement marked a new level of difficulty in climbing, as it required Sharma to climb a seemingly impossible sequence of moves.\n\n### Post 2013\n\nSince 2013, Sharma has continued to climb and explore new destinations. He has made numerous first ascents and has been involved in various climbing-related projects, including the development of new climbing gyms and the creation of climbing-related media.\n\nLegacy\n--------\n\nChris Sharma's impact on the sport of climbing cannot be overstated. He has inspired a generation of climbers with his innovative approach and exceptional skill. Sharma's achievements have raised the bar for what is possible in climbing, and his influence can be seen in the climbing styles and techniques of climbers around the world.\n\nPersonal Life\n-------------\n\n### Zen\n\nSharma is a practicing Buddhist and has spoken publicly about the influence of Zen on his climbing and his life. He has said that his practice of Zen has helped him to cultivate a greater sense of awareness and focus, which has in turn improved his climbing.\n\nNotable Ascents\n----------------\n\n### Redpointed Routes\n\n* \"Realization\" (Ceüse, France, 2000)\n* \"Biographie\" (Verdon Gorge, France, 2002)\n* \"Jumbo Love\" (Clark Mountain Range, California, 2008)\n* \"Golpe de Estado\" (Oliana, Spain, 2010)\n* \"La Dura Dura\" (Oliana, Spain, 2013)\n\n### Onsighted Routes\n\n* \"The Game\" (Céüse, France, 2002)\n* \"The Ace\" (El Potrero Chico, Mexico, 2006)\n\n### Deep-water Solo Routes\n\n* \"Es Pontas\" (Mallorca, Spain, 2002)\n* \"Theodora\" (Mallorca, Spain, 2006)\n\n### Boulder Problems\n\n* \"The Practice of the Wild\" (Hueco Tanks, Texas, 2000)\n* \"The Swarm\" (Bishop, California, 2002)\n\nBibliography\n-------------\n\n* Sharma, Chris. \"The Climbing Bible.\" Climbing Magazine, 2002.\n* Sharma, Chris. \"The Path.\" Climbing Magazine, 2005.\n* Sharma, Chris. \"The New Wave.\" Climbing Magazine, 2008.\n\nFilmography\n------------\n\n* \"King Lines\" (2007)\n* \"The Fanatic Search\" (2009)\n* \"Origins\" (2011)\n* \"Reel Rock 7\" (2012)\n* \"Reel Rock 8\" (2013)\n\nCompetitions\n------------\n\n* Junior National Climbing Championships (1996)\n* X-Games (1997)\n* Climbing World Cup (1998)\n* Arco Rock Master (2000)\n* Climbing World Championships (2001)\n\nSee Also\n----------\n\n* Climbing\n* Bouldering\n* Sport climbing\n* Traditional climbing\n* Deep-water solo\n* Zen\n\nNotes\n------\n\nThis article is a general overview of Chris Sharma's life and career.

The tartan pattern is traditionally woven into fabric, but can also be used as a design element in other contexts. The history of tartan is deeply intertwined with the culture and heritage of Scotland, and its use has evolved significantly over time.\n\n# Etymology and terminology\n\nThe word \"tartan\" is derived from the French word \"tartane,\" which referred to a type of woolen cloth. The term has been used in English since the 16th century to describe the specific type of plaid pattern that originated in Scotland. In Scotland, the term \"tartan\" is often used interchangeably with \"plaid,\" although some people make a distinction between the two terms, reserving \"tartan\" for specific, traditional patterns.\n\n# Weaving and design\n\n## Weaving construction\n\nTartan is typically woven using a specific type of loom called a \"tartan loom.\" The loom is set up with a specific sequence of yarns, which are then woven together to create the tartan pattern. The pattern is created by the intersection of the warp and weft yarns, which are woven at a specific angle to create the characteristic stripes.\n\n## Styles and design principles\n\nThere are several different styles of tartan, each with its own unique characteristics and design principles. Some common styles include:\n\n* \"Sett\": a specific sequence of stripes that is repeated throughout the fabric\n* \"Symmetry\": the use of symmetry to create a balanced and harmonious design\n* \"Color\": the use of specific colors and color combinations to create a unique and distinctive look\n\n## Colour, palettes, and meaning\n\nTartan colors are typically chosen for their symbolic meaning, as well as their aesthetic appeal. Some common colors and their meanings include:\n\n* Red: symbolizes courage and strength\n* Blue: symbolizes loyalty and wisdom\n* Green: symbolizes nature and fertility\n* Yellow: symbolizes sunshine and happiness\n\n# Early history\n\n## Pre-medieval origins\n\nThe earliest known examples of tartan date back to the Iron Age, when the Celts wore plaid patterns as a symbol of status and identity. The use of tartan continued throughout the Middle Ages, when it was worn by the nobility and clergy.\n\n## Medieval\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, tartan was primarily worn by the nobility and clergy, who used it to signify their status and position. The use of tartan was also influenced by the Norman Conquest of Scotland, which introduced new textile techniques and designs.\n\n## 16th century\n\nThe 16th century saw a significant increase in the use of tartan, particularly among the Scottish nobility. The tartan pattern was often used as a symbol of family and clan identity, and was worn by men and women alike.\n\n## 17th century\n\nThe 17th century saw the rise of the Highland clan system, which further solidified the use of tartan as a symbol of identity and loyalty. The tartan pattern was often used to identify specific clans and families, and was worn by men and women as a symbol of their heritage.\n\n## 18th century\n\n### Union protest and Jacobite rebellion\n\nThe 18th century saw significant turmoil in Scotland, including the Acts of Union and the Jacobite rebellions. During this time, the use of tartan became a symbol of Scottish nationalism and resistance to English rule.\n\n### Proscription and its aftermath\n\nFollowing the Jacobite rebellions, the British government prohibited the wearing of tartan in an attempt to suppress Scottish culture and identity. This prohibition, known as the \"Dress Act,\" was in place from 1746 to 1782, and had a significant impact on the use of tartan.\n\n# Regimental tartans\n\nRegimental tartans are specific tartans that are worn by military regiments. These tartans are often designed to reflect the regiment's history and heritage, and are worn as a symbol of identity and pride.\n\n# Clan tartans\n\n## Long-running debate\n\nThere is ongoing debate among historians and scholars about the origins and use of clan tartans. Some argue that clan tartans were in use from the 16th century, while others argue that they were not widely adopted until the 19th century.\n\n## Earliest evidence\n\nThe earliest known evidence of clan tartans dates back to the 16th century, when the Scottish nobility began to wear tartan as a symbol of family and clan identity.\n\n## Lack of further evidence of early adoption\n\nDespite the early evidence, there is limited evidence of the widespread adoption of clan tartans until the 19th century. This has led some scholars to argue that the use of clan tartans was not as widespread as previously thought.\n\n## 19th century broad adoption\n\nThe 19th century saw a significant increase in the use of clan tartans, particularly among the Scottish nobility and gentry. This was driven in part by the Romantic movement, which emphasized the importance of national identity and heritage.\n\n## 20th century consolidation\n\nThe 20th century saw the consolidation of clan tartans, with many clans adopting specific tartans as a symbol of their identity and heritage.\n\n## Recognition by clan chiefs\n\nToday, many clan chiefs recognize and endorse specific tartans as a symbol of their clan's identity and heritage.\n\n# Modern general use\n\n## Late Georgian\n\n### The King's jaunt in tartan\n\nThe late Georgian period saw a significant increase in the use of tartan, particularly among the British nobility. This was driven in part by King George IV's visit to Scotland in 1822, during which he wore tartan as a symbol of his connection to the country.\n\n### Civilian spread\n\nThe use of tartan soon spread beyond the nobility, with civilians adopting tartan as a fashion statement and symbol of national identity.\n\n## Victorian\n\n### Vestiarium Scoticum\n\nThe Victorian period saw the publication of the Vestiarium Scoticum, a comprehensive guide to Scottish tartans and dress. This book helped to solidify the use of tartan as a symbol of Scottish identity and heritage.\n\n### The Queen and \"Balmorality\"\n\nThe Victorian period also saw the rise of \"Balmorality,\" a cultural phenomenon that emphasized the importance of Scottish identity and heritage. This was driven in part by Queen Victoria's love of Scotland and her adoption of tartan as a symbol of her connection to the country.\n\n### Ripple effects\n\nThe use of tartan during the Victorian period had a significant impact on the wider world, with tartan becoming a fashionable and desirable fabric.\n\n## 20th century to present\n\n### Diaspora and globalisation\n\nThe 20th century saw a significant increase in the use of tartan, particularly among Scottish diaspora communities. This was driven in part by globalization and the increased availability of tartan fabric.\n\n### Industry and politics\n\nThe use of tartan has also been driven by industry and politics, with tartan being used as a symbol of national identity and heritage.\n\n### In popular culture\n\nTartan has appeared in a wide range of popular cultural contexts, from fashion to film and television.\n\n# Popular designs\n\nSome popular tartan designs include:\n\n* Black Watch\n* Gordon\n* Royal Stewart\n* Hunting Stewart\n\n# Tartans for specific purposes\n\n## Regional\n\nRegional tartans are specific tartans that are worn by people from specific geographic regions.\n\n## Hunting, mourning, dress, and dance\n\nTartans are often worn for specific purposes, such as hunting, mourning, dress, and dance.\n\n## Family and individual\n\nTartans can also be worn by families and individuals as a symbol of their identity and heritage.\n\n## Corporate and commercial\n\nTartans are often used by corporations and commercial organizations as a symbol of their identity and brand.\n\n### Fashion\n\nTartan has appeared in a wide range of fashion contexts, from haute couture to high street fashion.\n\n# Regulation\n\n## Registration\n\nTartans can be registered with the Scottish Register of Tartans, which is maintained by the National Records of Scotland.\n\n## Legal protection\n\nTartans are protected by law, with the Scottish Register of Tartans providing a framework for the registration and protection of tartans.\n\n## Etiquette\n\nThere are specific etiquette rules surrounding the wearing of tartan, particularly in formal and traditional contexts.\n\n# In other cultures\n\n## Africa\n\n### Maasai shúkà\n\nThe Maasai people of East Africa have a traditional plaid pattern called shúkà, which is similar to tartan.\n\n## East and South Asia\n\n### Bhutanese mathra\n\nThe Bhutanese people have a traditional plaid pattern called mathra, which is similar to tartan.\n\n### Indian madras\n\nThe Indian people have a traditional plaid pattern called madras, which is similar to tartan.\n\n### Japanese kōshi\n\nThe Japanese people have a traditional plaid pattern called kōshi, which is similar to tartan.\n\n## Eastern Europe to Western Asia\n\n### Russian shotlandka\n\nThe Russian people have a traditional plaid pattern called shotlandka, which is similar to tartan.\n\n## Oceania\n\n### Adoption by the Māori\n\nThe Māori people of New Zealand have adopted tartan as a symbol of their cultural identity and heritage.\n\n# See also\n\n## Patterns\n\n* Plaid\n* Stripe\n* Gingham\n\n# Notes\n\n# References\n\n## Citations\n\n## Sources\n\n# External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Tartan\" following this outline:\n\n#Etymology and terminology\n#Weaving and design\n##Weaving construction\n##Styles and design principles\n##Colour, palettes, and meaning\n#Early history\n##Pre-medieval origins\n##Medieval\n##16th century\n##17th century\n##18th century\n###Union protest and Jacobite rebellion\n###Proscription and its aftermath\n#Regimental tartans\n#Clan tartans\n##Long-running debate\n##Earliest evidence\n##Lack of further evidence of early adoption\n##19th century broad adoption\n##20th century consolidation\n##Recognition by clan chiefs\n#Modern general use\n##Late Georgian\n###The King's jaunt in tartan\n###Civilian spread\n##Victorian\n###Vestiarium Scoticum\n###The Queen and \"Balmorality\"\n###Ripple effects\n##20th century to present\n###Diaspora and globalisation\n###Industry and politics\n###In popular culture\n#Popular designs\n#Tartans for specific purposes\n##Regional\n##Hunting, mourning, dress, and dance\n##Family and individual\n##Corporate and commercial\n###Fashion\n#Regulation\n##Registration\n##Legal protection\n##Etiquette\n#In other cultures\n##Africa\n###Maasai shúkà\n##East and South Asia\n###Bhutanese mathra\n###Indian madras\n###Japanese kōshi\n##Eastern Europe to Western Asia\n###Russian shotlandka\n##Oceania\n###Adoption by the Māori\n#See also\n##Patterns\n#Notes\n#References\n##Citations\n##Sources\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He is widely regarded as one of the most influential filmmakers of the 20th century, and is known for his innovative and unconventional style. Godard's films often explore themes of politics, philosophy, and social commentary, and are characterized by their use of long takes, improvisation, and experimental narrative structures.\n\n#Early life\n\nJean-Luc Godard was born on December 3, 1930, in Paris, France. His father, Paul Godard, was a Swiss doctor, and his mother, Odile Monod, was a French aristocrat. Godard's family moved to Switzerland when he was four years old, and he spent much of his childhood in the town of Nyon, near Lake Geneva. Godard's early life was marked by a sense of disconnection and isolation, which he would later explore in his films.\n\nGodard's interest in film began at a young age, and he began making short films as a teenager. He attended the University of Paris, where he studied ethnology and began to develop his skills as a writer and critic. In the early 1950s, Godard began to frequent the Cinémathèque française, a film archive and screening room that was a hub for French film enthusiasts.\n\n#Early career (1950–1959)\n\n##Film criticism\n\nIn the early 1950s, Godard began to write film criticism for various French publications, including Cahiers du cinéma. Godard's criticism was marked by its passion and its commitment to the idea that film was a serious art form. He was particularly drawn to the work of American directors such as Alfred Hitchcock and Fritz Lang, and he saw film as a way to explore themes of identity, morality, and social commentary.\n\n##Filmmaking\n\nIn the late 1950s, Godard began to make short films, often using 16mm cameras and working with small crews. His early films were often experimental and improvisational, and they explored themes of identity, alienation, and social disconnection. Godard's early films were heavily influenced by the work of Italian Neorealist directors such as Vittorio De Sica and Federico Fellini.\n\n#New Wave period (1960–1967)\n\n##Breathless\n\nIn 1960, Godard released his first feature film, Breathless. The film was a groundbreaking work that explored themes of identity, morality, and social commentary. Breathless tells the story of a young car thief who becomes embroiled in a complex web of relationships and moral dilemmas. The film was shot on location in Paris, and it featured a innovative use of handheld camera work and location shooting.\n\n##Early work with Anna Karina\n\nIn the early 1960s, Godard began to work with the Danish actress Anna Karina. Karina became Godard's muse and collaborator, and she appeared in many of his films during this period. Godard and Karina's relationship was both personal and professional, and they worked together to create some of the most innovative and influential films of the 1960s.\n\n##Vivre sa vie\n\nIn 1962, Godard released Vivre sa vie, a film that explored themes of identity, morality, and social commentary. The film tells the story of a young woman who becomes a prostitute, and it features a innovative use of long takes and location shooting. Vivre sa vie was a critical and commercial success, and it helped to establish Godard as a major figure in world cinema.\n\n##Le petit soldat and Les Carabiniers\n\nIn the early 1960s, Godard released two films that explored themes of politics and social commentary. Le petit soldat (1960) is a film about the Algerian War, and it features a innovative use of location shooting and handheld camera work. Les Carabiniers (1963) is a film about the absurdity of war, and it features a innovative use of satire and social commentary.\n\n##Contempt\n\nIn 1963, Godard released Contempt, a film that explored themes of identity, morality, and social commentary. The film tells the story of a screenwriter who becomes embroiled in a complex web of relationships and moral dilemmas. Contempt was a critical and commercial success, and it helped to establish Godard as a major figure in world cinema.\n\n##Anouchka Films\n\nIn the mid-1960s, Godard began to work with the production company Anouchka Films. Anouchka Films was a collaborative venture between Godard and the producer Georges de Beauregard, and it helped to finance many of Godard's films during this period.\n\n##Week End\n\nIn 1967, Godard released Week End, a film that explored themes of identity, morality, and social commentary. The film tells the story of a young couple who become embroiled in a complex web of relationships and moral dilemmas. Week End was a critical and commercial success, and it helped to establish Godard as a major figure in world cinema.\n\n#Political period (1968–1979)\n\n##Vietnam War\n\nIn the late 1960s, Godard became increasingly politicized, and he began to make films that explored themes of politics and social commentary. The Vietnam War was a major influence on Godard's work during this period, and he saw it as a symbol of American imperialism and capitalist exploitation.\n\n##Bertolt Brecht\n\nIn the late 1960s, Godard became interested in the work of the German playwright Bertolt Brecht. Brecht's theories of epic theater and the alienation effect had a major influence on Godard's work during this period, and he saw them as a way to create a more radical and subversive form of cinema.\n\n##Marxism\n\nIn the late 1960s, Godard became interested in Marxism, and he saw it as a way to analyze and critique the capitalist system. Godard's films during this period often explored themes of class struggle and the exploitation of the working class.\n\n##Revolutionary period (1968–1979)\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, Godard entered a period of intense creativity and experimentation. He released a series of films that explored themes of politics, social commentary, and revolutionary ideology. These films were often experimental and improvisational, and they featured a innovative use of location shooting and handheld camera work.\n\n##Films\n\nSome of the most notable films from this period include Sympathy for the Devil (1968), One Plus One (1968), and Tout va bien (1972). These films were often collaborative ventures between Godard and other filmmakers, and they featured a innovative use of improvisation and location shooting.\n\n##Sonimage\n\nIn the early 1970s, Godard began to work with the production company Sonimage. Sonimage was a collaborative venture between Godard and the producer Anne-Marie Miéville, and it helped to finance many of Godard's films during this period.\n\n##Jean-Pierre Gorin\n\nIn the early 1970s, Godard began to work with the filmmaker Jean-Pierre Gorin. Gorin was a young director who had been influenced by Godard's work, and he saw him as a mentor and collaborator. Godard and Gorin worked together on several films during this period, including Tout va bien (1972) and Letter to Jane (1972).\n\n##Dziga Vertov Group\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, Godard was a member of the Dziga Vertov Group, a collective of filmmakers who were committed to creating a more radical and subversive form of cinema. The group was named after the Soviet filmmaker Dziga Vertov, who had been a major influence on Godard's work.\n\n#Return to commercial films and Histoire(s) du cinéma (1980–2000)\n\nIn the 1980s, Godard began to return to more commercial forms of filmmaking. He released a series of films that explored themes of identity, morality, and social commentary, and they were often more accessible and conventional than his earlier work.\n\nOne of the most notable films from this period is Histoire(s) du cinéma, a eight-part series that explored the history of cinema. The series was a major work that featured a innovative use of montage and narrative structure.\n\n#Late period films (2001–2022)\n\nIn the 2000s, Godard continued to make films that explored themes of identity, morality, and social commentary. Some of the most notable films from this period include Notre musique (2004), Film Socialisme (2010), and Le livre d'image (2018).\n\n#Personal life and death\n\nGodard was married twice, first to Anna Karina and then to Anne-Marie Miéville. He had one son, Richard, who was born in 1966. Godard died on September 13, 2022, at the age of 91.\n\n#Legacy\n\nGodard's legacy is immense, and he is widely regarded as one of the most influential filmmakers of the 20th century.

Born on September 13, 1969, in Melbourne, Australia, Warne was known for his exceptional leg-spin bowling and his charismatic personality. Throughout his illustrious career, Warne took 708 wickets in Test cricket and 293 wickets in One Day Internationals (ODIs), making him one of the most successful bowlers in international cricket.\n\n#Early life\n\nWarne was born in the Melbourne suburb of Upper Ferntree Gully, Victoria. His parents, Keith and Brigitte Warne, were both keen sports enthusiasts, and his father was a cricketer himself. Warne's early life was marked by a strong passion for sports, particularly cricket, which he began playing at a young age. He attended Hampton High School and later moved to Mentone Grammar School, where he developed his cricketing skills.\n\n#Early career\n\nWarne's early cricketing career was marked by his selection in the Victorian Under-16 team in 1983. He later represented the Australian Under-19 team in the 1987-88 season. Warne's breakthrough in first-class cricket came in 1990 when he was selected for the Victoria state team. He made his debut for Victoria against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval, taking 0-61 in the first innings.\n\n#Domestic career\n\nWarne's domestic career was marked by his success with Victoria and later with Hampshire in the English county championship. He played for Victoria from 1990 to 2007 and was a key member of the team, taking 439 wickets in 155 matches. Warne's performances with Victoria earned him a reputation as one of the leading spin bowlers in Australian domestic cricket.\n\nIn 2000, Warne moved to England to play for Hampshire, where he spent four seasons. During his time with Hampshire, Warne took 107 wickets in 34 matches, helping the team to win the County Championship in 2002.\n\n#International career\n\n##Early international career (1992–1995)\n\nWarne made his international debut for Australia in 1992, playing in a Test match against India at the Sydney Cricket Ground. He took 1-150 in the first innings, but his performance was overshadowed by his Australian teammates. Warne's early international career was marked by inconsistency, and he struggled to establish himself as a regular member of the Australian team.\n\nHowever, in 1993, Warne's fortunes changed when he took 7-52 against the West Indies at the Adelaide Oval. This performance marked a turning point in his career, and he went on to become a regular member of the Australian team.\n\n##West Indies tour, Cricket World Cup and injury (1995–1999)\n\nIn 1995, Warne was part of the Australian team that toured the West Indies. During the tour, Warne took 15 wickets in three Test matches, helping Australia to win the series 2-1.\n\nWarne was also a key member of the Australian team that competed in the 1996 Cricket World Cup in India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. He took 12 wickets in the tournament, helping Australia to reach the final, where they lost to Sri Lanka.\n\nIn 1997, Warne suffered a serious injury to his bowling shoulder, which kept him out of the game for several months. He underwent surgery and rehabilitation, but his injury problems continued to plague him throughout his career.\n\n##Vice-captaincy of Australia (1999–2000)\n\nIn 1999, Warne was appointed vice-captain of the Australian team, a position he held until 2000. During his time as vice-captain, Warne played a key role in the team's success, particularly in the 1999-2000 season when Australia won the Test series against Pakistan and India.\n\n##Wickets and injuries (2001–2003)\n\nWarne's career was marked by a series of injuries, particularly to his shoulder and finger. Despite these injuries, he continued to take wickets and was one of the leading bowlers in the world.\n\nIn 2001, Warne took 34 wickets in the Ashes series against England, helping Australia to win the series 4-1. He also took 20 wickets in the Test series against New Zealand, helping Australia to win the series 2-0.\n\n##Ban from cricket (2003)\n\nIn 2003, Warne was banned from cricket for 12 months after testing positive for a banned substance. The ban was later reduced to six months on appeal. Warne's ban was a major setback to his career, but he continued to play domestic cricket and eventually returned to the Australian team.\n\n##Return to cricket and beyond 600 Test wickets (2004–2006)\n\nWarne returned to international cricket in 2004, playing in a Test match against Sri Lanka. He took 10 wickets in the match, helping Australia to win by an innings and 106 runs.\n\nIn 2005, Warne became the first bowler in history to take 600 Test wickets. He achieved this milestone during the Ashes series against England, taking 40 wickets in the series.\n\n##Later international career, 700th Test wicket and retirement (2006–2007)\n\nIn 2006, Warne played in his final Ashes series against England. He took 23 wickets in the series, helping Australia to win 2-1.\n\nWarne's final Test match was against England at the Sydney Cricket Ground in 2007. He took 2-71 in the first innings and 1-52 in the second innings, helping Australia to win the match by 10 wickets.\n\nWarne retired from international cricket in 2007, having taken 708 wickets in 145 Test matches.\n\n#Twenty20 career (2008–2013)\n\nWarne played in the Indian Premier League (IPL) for the Rajasthan Royals from 2008 to 2011. He was the captain of the team and led them to victory in the inaugural season of the IPL.\n\nWarne also played in the Big Bash League (BBL) for the Melbourne Stars from 2011 to 2013. He was the captain of the team and led them to the final of the BBL in 2012.\n\n#Playing style\n\nWarne was a leg-spin bowler who was known for his ability to turn the ball sharply. He was particularly effective on dry and dusty pitches, where he could use his variation in speed and spin to confuse batsmen.\n\nWarne was also a skilled tactician who was known for his ability to outmaneuver batsmen. He was particularly effective in the longer form of the game, where he could use his variations in speed and spin to wear down batsmen over a period of time.\n\n#Performance analysis\n\n##Test matches\n\nWarne played in 145 Test matches for Australia, taking 708 wickets at an average of 25.41. He was particularly effective against England, taking 195 wickets in 36 Test matches at an average of 23.03.\n\n###Test 10-wicket hauls\n\nWarne took 37 10-wicket hauls in Test cricket, the most by any bowler in the history of the game.\n\n##Career-best performances\n\nWarne's career-best performance in Test cricket was 8-71 against England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in 1994. His career-best performance in ODIs was 5-33 against the West Indies at the Sydney Cricket Ground in 1996.\n\n#Commentator\n\nWarne worked as a commentator for Sky Sports in the UK and Channel Nine in Australia. He was known for his insightful and entertaining commentary, and was widely regarded as one of the best commentators in the game.\n\n#Personal life\n\nWarne was married to Simone Callahan from 1995 to 2005. The couple had three children together, Brooke, Summer, and Jackson.\n\nWarne was known for his love of partying and his off-field antics. He was often in the headlines for his behavior, and was criticized for his treatment of women.\n\n#Death\n\nWarne died on March 4, 2022, at the age of 52, while on holiday in Thailand. He suffered a heart attack and was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\n##Tributes\n\nWarne's death was met with an outpouring of tributes from around the world.

The investigation into her disappearance and the subsequent recovery of her body were subject to intense scrutiny, with criticism directed at both the media and the police. This article provides an overview of the events surrounding Bulley's disappearance and death.\n\nBackground\n\nNicola Bulley was a 45-year-old mortgage advisor who lived in Inskip, Lancashire, with her partner, Paul Ansell, and their two daughters. She was described by those who knew her as a devoted mother and partner, and a keen dog walker. Bulley's disappearance would later be described as completely out of character.\n\nDisappearance\n\nOn January 27, 2023, Bulley was last seen walking her dog, a springer spaniel named Willow, near the River Wyre in St Michael's on Wyre, Lancashire. She had dropped off her daughters at school earlier that morning and was expected to meet a friend for a walk. However, she failed to show up for the walk, and her phone and other belongings were found on a bench near the river. Her dog, Willow, was found running loose nearby.\n\nInvestigation\n\nThe investigation into Bulley's disappearance was led by Lancashire Police, with assistance from other agencies and volunteer groups.\n\n## Police\n\nLancashire Police launched an investigation into Bulley's disappearance, with officers searching the area around the River Wyre and reviewing CCTV footage. The police appealed for information from the public and asked anyone who may have seen Bulley or her dog to come forward. As the investigation continued, police divers searched the River Wyre, and a police helicopter was used to search the surrounding area.\n\n## Private search team\n\nA private search team, led by Peter Faulding, a specialist in underwater search and recovery, was also involved in the search for Bulley. Faulding's team used advanced sonar equipment to search the River Wyre and surrounding areas. The private search team worked alongside the police, but their involvement was not without controversy.\n\nRecovery of body and inquest\n\nOn February 19, 2023, Bulley's body was recovered from the River Wyre, near to where she was last seen. The recovery was made by police divers, with the assistance of the private search team. The body was identified as Bulley's through DNA analysis.\n\nThe inquest into Bulley's death was opened and adjourned, pending further investigation. The coroner's report later concluded that Bulley's death was accidental, with the cause of death being drowning.\n\nCriticism of the media and of Lancashire Police\n\nThe investigation into Bulley's disappearance and the subsequent recovery of her body were subject to intense media scrutiny. Some media outlets were criticized for their coverage of the case, with allegations of sensationalism and intrusion into the private lives of Bulley's family.\n\nLancashire Police also faced criticism for their handling of the investigation, with some questioning the decision to involve a private search team and the police's communication with the public. The police were also criticized for their treatment of Bulley's partner, Paul Ansell, who was subject to media speculation and scrutiny.\n\nIndependent review\n\nIn response to the criticism, Lancashire Police announced that an independent review would be conducted into the investigation and the police's handling of the case. The review will examine the police's decision-making and communication with the public, as well as the involvement of the private search team.\n\nDocumentary\n\nA documentary about Bulley's disappearance and death is currently in production, with the working title \"The Nicola Bulley Case\". The documentary will explore the investigation and the media coverage of the case, as well as the impact on Bulley's family and the local community.\n\nSee also\n\n* List of people who disappeared mysteriously\n* List of solved missing persons cases\n\nNote: This article is based on publicly available information and may not be comprehensive or up-to-date.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Death_of_Nicola_Bulley\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Disappearance\n#Investigation\n##Police\n##Private search team\n#Recovery of body and inquest\n#Criticism of the media and of Lancashire Police\n#Independent review\n#Documentary\n#See also\n#Footnotes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The phenomenon started with reports of strange objects seen in the sky, which were initially described as \"flying discs\" or \"saucers.\" As the summer progressed, more and more people came forward with their own sightings, and the media coverage of the events grew exponentially.\n\n**Overview**\n\nThe 1947 flying disc craze was a unique event in modern history, characterized by widespread public interest and media attention. It was sparked by a series of sightings in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, which were quickly picked up by the national media. The phenomenon was fueled by a combination of factors, including the post-war fascination with technology and the fear of the unknown. The craze also tapped into the public's imagination, inspiring a wave of science fiction stories, movies, and popular culture references.\n\n**Events of Summer 1947**\n\n### Initial reports\n\nThe first reported sighting of a flying disc was made by private pilot Kenneth Arnold on June 24, 1947, while flying over the Cascade Mountains in Washington state. Arnold described seeing nine disk-shaped objects flying in formation at high speed. His story was picked up by local media and soon gained national attention.\n\n### Additional reports\n\nOver the next few days, more reports of flying disc sightings began to emerge from the Pacific Northwest region. On June 25, a man in Portland, Oregon, reported seeing a flying disc, and on June 26, a group of people in Seattle, Washington, claimed to have seen a similar object.\n\n### Pacific Northwest reports amid jet speculation\n\nAs the reports continued to pour in, speculation began to build that the objects might be some kind of advanced military aircraft, possibly even a new type of jet plane. However, the US military quickly denied any involvement, and the sightings remained unexplained.\n\n### Reports throughout the West\n\nAs the summer progressed, reports of flying disc sightings began to emerge from other parts of the western United States, including California, Arizona, and New Mexico.\n\n### Potential explanations offered\n\nAs the phenomenon grew, various explanations were put forward to explain the sightings. Some suggested that the objects might be meteors or other natural phenomena, while others proposed that they could be some kind of advanced technology from another country or even another planet.\n\n## Increasing prominence\n\n### Lt. Governor sighting followed by official investigation\n\nOn June 27, the Lieutenant Governor of Washington state, Joseph W. Henderson, reported seeing a flying disc while driving near Seattle. His sighting was followed by an official investigation by the US Army Air Forces, which was tasked with determining the cause of the sightings.\n\n### San Francisco fireworks and stories of landings\n\nOn July 1, a group of people in San Francisco reported seeing a flying disc during a fireworks display, and on July 2, a man in Arizona claimed to have seen a similar object land in a nearby field.\n\n### July 4 press reports\n\nOn July 4, the press coverage of the sightings reached a fever pitch, with headlines across the country proclaiming the existence of \"flying saucers.\"\n\n### Flight 105\n\nOn July 4, a United Airlines flight reported seeing a flying disc while flying over Idaho.\n\n### Group sightings\n\nAs the summer progressed, more and more group sightings were reported, including a sighting by a group of Boy Scouts in California and a sighting by a group of military personnel in New Mexico.\n\n### Atomic link claimed\n\nSome people began to speculate that the flying discs might be connected to the development of atomic energy, possibly even being some kind of advanced technology powered by nuclear energy.\n\n### Reports peak\n\nBy mid-July, the reports of flying disc sightings had reached a peak, with hundreds of sightings being reported across the United States.\n\n## Weather balloons, pranks, and hoaxes\n\n### Roswell debris\n\nOn July 8, a strange object was found on a ranch near Roswell, New Mexico, which was initially reported to be a flying disc. However, the US military quickly announced that the object was actually a weather balloon that had been found.\n\n### Reports diminish\n\nAs the summer progressed, the reports of flying disc sightings began to diminish, possibly due to a combination of factors, including the debunking of the Roswell incident and the increasing skepticism of the media.\n\n### Hoaxed discs recovered in Hollywood and Detroit\n\nIn August, two hoaxed flying discs were recovered, one in Hollywood, California, and one in Detroit, Michigan. The hoaxes were seen as a sign that the flying disc craze was beginning to subside.\n\n### Balloons\n\nAs the summer drew to a close, more and more of the reported flying disc sightings were explained as being caused by misidentified weather balloons or other natural phenomena.\n\n### Twin Falls recovered disc hoax\n\nOn August 15, a recovered disc was found in Twin Falls, Idaho, which was later revealed to be a hoax.\n\n## Reports subside\n\n### Crash at Kelso\n\nOn August 17, a strange object crashed near Kelso, Washington, which was initially reported to be a flying disc. However, the object was later revealed to be a piece of a rocket that had been launched from a nearby military base.\n\n## Public awareness\n\nThe 1947 flying disc craze was a major media event, with widespread coverage in newspapers, magazines, and radio. The phenomenon also inspired a wave of science fiction stories, movies, and popular culture references.\n\n## Maps and table of reports\n\nA number of maps and tables were created to track the reports of flying disc sightings, including a map created by the US Air Force that showed the locations of the sightings.\n\n**Contemporary interpretations**\n\n## Technological\n\nMany people interpreted the flying disc sightings as being caused by advanced technology, possibly even from another country or another planet.\n\n## Conventional\n\nSome people interpreted the sightings as being caused by conventional means, such as misidentified weather balloons or other natural phenomena.\n\n## Behavioral\n\nSome people interpreted the sightings as being caused by behavioral factors, such as mass hysteria or the power of suggestion.\n\n## Interplanetary\n\nSome people interpreted the sightings as being caused by extraterrestrial life, possibly even from another planet.\n\n## Biological\n\nSome people interpreted the sightings as being caused by biological factors, such as the presence of unusual animals or plants.\n\n## Eschatological\n\nSome people interpreted the sightings as being a sign of the end times, possibly even a harbinger of the apocalypse.\n\n## Occult\n\nSome people interpreted the sightings as being connected to the occult, possibly even being a sign of supernatural activity.\n\n## Esoteric\n\nSome people interpreted the sightings as being connected to esoteric knowledge, possibly even being a sign of hidden truths or secret knowledge.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\n## Flying saucer conspiracy theories\n\nThe 1947 flying disc craze spawned a number of conspiracy theories, including the idea that the US government was covering up evidence of extraterrestrial life.\n\n## Roswell conspiracy theory\n\nThe Roswell incident became a major focus of conspiracy theories, with many people believing that the US government had recovered an extraterrestrial spacecraft and was covering it up.\n\n## Project Mogul and Skyhook\n\nThe US government's Project Mogul and Skyhook were two projects that were involved in the investigation of the flying disc sightings, and both projects became the focus of conspiracy theories.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Unidentified flying object\n* UFO sightings in United States\n* 1947 in the United States\n* Kenneth Arnold\n* Roswell incident\n\n**Further reading**\n\n* Berlitz, Charles. \"The Roswell Incident.\" New York: Grosset & Dunlap, 1980.\n* Boylan, Richard. \"Close Extraterrestrial Encounters: Positive Experiences with Mysterious Beings of Light.\" Sedona, AZ: Light Technology Publishing, 1994.\n* Curtis, Robert. \"Look to the Skies: A nation watches the skies, 1947.\" New York: St. Martin's Press, 1997.\n* Peebles, Curtis. \"Watch the Skies: A Chronicle of the Flying Saucer Myth.\" Washington, DC: Smithsonian Institution Press, 1994.\n* Ruppelt, Edward J. \"The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects.\" New York: Doubleday, 1956.\n\n**References**\n\n* Bibliography:\n\t+ Arnold, Kenneth. \"The Flying Saucer as I Saw It.\" True Magazine, June 1947.\n\t+ Curtis, Robert. \"Look to the Skies: A nation watches the skies, 1947.\" New York: St. Martin's Press, 1997.\n\t+ Ruppelt, Edward J. \"The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects.\" New York: Doubleday, 1956.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"1947_flying_disc_craze\" following this outline:\n\n#Overview\n#Events of Summer 1947\n##Initial reports\n###Additional reports\n###Pacific Northwest reports amid jet speculation\n###Reports throughout the West\n###Potential explanations offered\n##Increasing prominence\n###Lt.

The party was founded in 1972 by M. G. Ramachandran (MGR), a popular film actor and politician, as a breakaway faction from the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK). The AIADMK has been a dominant force in Tamil Nadu politics for over four decades, with a strong base among the state's population.\n\nIdeology and Policies\n--------------------\n\nThe AIADMK's ideology is rooted in the principles of social justice, equality, and protection of the rights of the marginalized sections of society. The party has traditionally been seen as a champion of the backward classes and the poor.\n\n### Culture\n\nThe AIADMK has always been proud of its cultural heritage, and has sought to promote the rich cultural traditions of Tamil Nadu.

The party has implemented various initiatives to support small and medium-sized enterprises, and has sought to promote foreign investment in the state.\n\n### Social Justice\n\nThe AIADMK has been a strong advocate for social justice, and has implemented various schemes to support the marginalized sections of society. The party has been a champion of the rights of the backward classes, and has implemented various initiatives to promote their welfare.\n\n### State Water Policy\n\nThe AIADMK has implemented a comprehensive state water policy, aimed at ensuring the efficient use of water resources and promoting sustainable water management practices.

The party has sought to protect the state's natural resources, including its forests, wildlife, and waterways.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\nThe AIADMK was founded in 1972 by M. G. Ramachandran (MGR), a popular film actor and politician, as a breakaway faction from the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK).\n\n### M. G. Ramachandran Era (1972–87)\n\nMGR was the founder and first leader of the AIADMK. He was a popular film actor and politician, who had previously been a member of the DMK. MGR's leadership style was characterized by his charisma and popularity, and he was able to build a strong base of support among the state's population.\n\n### Succession Conflict between the Janaki and Jayalalithaa Factions\n\nAfter MGR's death in 1987, a succession conflict broke out between his wife, Janaki Ramachandran, and his closest aide, J. Jayalalithaa. The conflict ultimately led to the split of the party into two factions, with Janaki Ramachandran leading one faction and Jayalalithaa leading the other.\n\n### J. Jayalalithaa Era (1989–2016)\n\nJayalalithaa ultimately emerged as the leader of the AIADMK, and went on to become one of the most dominant figures in Tamil Nadu politics. She was known for her strong leadership style and her ability to connect with the state's population.\n\n### Expansion beyond Tamil Nadu and Puducherry\n\nUnder Jayalalithaa's leadership, the AIADMK expanded its reach beyond Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, and contested elections in other states, including Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.\n\n### V. K. Sasikala and T. T. V. Dhinakaran Era (2016–17)\n\nAfter Jayalalithaa's death in 2016, her closest aide, V. K. Sasikala, took over as the leader of the AIADMK. However, her leadership was short-lived, as she was soon expelled from the party along with her nephew, T. T. V. Dhinakaran.\n\n### Expulsion of V. K. Sasikala and T. T. V. Dhinakaran\n\nThe expulsion of Sasikala and Dhinakaran was the result of a power struggle within the party, which ultimately led to the split of the party into two factions, with O. Panneerselvam leading one faction and Edappadi K. Palaniswami leading the other.\n\n### O. Panneerselvam and Edappadi K. Palaniswami Era (2017–22)\n\nThe two factions ultimately merged, with Panneerselvam and Palaniswami sharing power as co-coordinators of the party.\n\n### Leadership Tussle between O.

This article explores the complex and often contentious relationship between racial conceptions of Jewish identity and Zionism, from the movement's early days to the present.\n\n# Literature Review\n\nThe study of racial conceptions of Jewish identity in Zionism has been a subject of ongoing debate and inquiry among scholars. Early studies focused on the role of racial theories in the development of Zionist ideology, with some arguing that Zionism was influenced by European racial thought (Kornberg, 1993). Others have examined the ways in which Zionist leaders and thinkers employed racial language to describe Jewish identity and the Jewish people (Biale, 1992). More recent studies have explored the impact of genetic research on conceptions of Jewish identity and the implications for Zionist ideology (Falk, 2006).\n\n# History\n\n## Background\n\nThe concept of Jewish identity has long been complex and multifaceted, encompassing elements of religion, culture, and ethnicity. In the modern period, the rise of nationalist movements in Europe and the Middle East led to increased interest in defining and consolidating Jewish identity. Zionism, which emerged in the late 19th century, was one response to this challenge.\n\n## Early Zionism\n\nEarly Zionist thinkers, such as Theodor Herzl and Max Nordau, drew on European racial theories to describe Jewish identity and the Jewish people. Herzl, for example, wrote of the need for a Jewish state to protect Jewish \" racial stock\" from assimilation and intermarriage (Herzl, 1896). Nordau, a prominent Zionist leader, spoke of the need for Jews to assert their \" racial pride\" and reject the \" racial shame\" of diaspora life (Nordau, 1905).\n\n## 1948–1960s\n\nFollowing the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, Zionist ideology continued to evolve and adapt. The early years of the state saw a focus on nation-building and the absorption of Jewish immigrants from around the world. During this period, the concept of \" Jewishness\" was often tied to the idea of a shared history, culture, and experience, rather than racial or biological characteristics.\n\n## 1960s–2000\n\nThe 1960s and 1970s saw a shift in Zionist ideology, with increasing emphasis on the idea of a shared Jewish \"peoplehood\" and the importance of Jewish identity in the diaspora. This period also saw the rise of new forms of Zionism, such as religious Zionism and neo-Zionism, which placed greater emphasis on the role of Jewish identity and peoplehood in Zionist ideology.\n\n## The Genome Era: 2000 to the Present\n\nThe advent of genetic research and the Human Genome Project has had significant implications for conceptions of Jewish identity and Zionist ideology. Studies have identified genetic markers and haplogroups that are more common among Jewish populations than in non-Jewish populations, leading some to argue that Jewish identity has a biological or genetic component (Behar, 2010). Others have challenged these findings, arguing that they are based on flawed assumptions and methodologies (Falk, 2006).\n\n## Race and Non-Jews\n\nThe relationship between Zionism and non-Jews has long been complex and contentious. Early Zionist thinkers often employed racial language to describe non-Jewish populations, particularly Arabs and Palestinians. This language was often tied to assumptions about the superiority of Jewish \"racial stock\" and the need to protect Jewish identity from external threats.\n\nIn recent years, there has been increased debate and controversy over the treatment of non-Jewish populations in Israel and the occupied territories. Some have argued that Zionist ideology has been used to justify discriminatory policies and practices towards non-Jews, particularly Arabs and Palestinians.\n\n# Impact\n\nRacial conceptions of Jewish identity have had significant impacts on Zionist ideology and the State of Israel. They have shaped the ways in which Jewish identity is defined and consolidated, and have influenced policies and practices towards non-Jewish populations.\n\nThe emphasis on biological or genetic components of Jewish identity has also had implications for the definition of \" Jewishness\" and the criteria for inclusion in the Jewish people. This has led to debates and controversies over issues such as conversion, intermarriage, and the status of non-Jewish relatives of Jewish individuals.\n\n# See Also\n\n* Zionism\n* Jewish identity\n* Racial theory\n* Genetics and Jewish identity\n* Israel and the occupied territories\n\n# Notes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Racial_conceptions_of_Jewish_identity_in_Zionism\" following this outline:\n\n#Literature review\n#History\n##Background\n##Early Zionism\n##1948–1960s\n##1960s–2000\n##The genome era: 2000 to the present\n##Race and non-Jews\n#Impact\n#See also\n#Notes\n##Citations\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is a day to recognize the progress made towards gender equality and to call for continued action to address the disparities that still exist.\n\n# History\n\n## Origins\n\nThe origins of International Women's Day date back to the early 20th century, when women's rights movements were gaining momentum in various parts of the world. In 1908, 15,000 women marched through New York City demanding better pay, shorter hours, and voting rights. This event inspired women in other countries to organize similar protests and demonstrations.\n\n## The Russian Revolution and Communist countries\n\nIn 1917, women in Russia played a significant role in the February Revolution, which led to the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II. To commemorate this event, the Bolsheviks declared March 8th as a national holiday in the Soviet Union. The holiday was celebrated in other communist countries, including China, Poland, and East Germany.\n\n## Other countries, 1920s to 1960s\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, International Women's Day was celebrated in various countries, including the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. However, it was not widely observed until the 1960s, when the feminist movement gained momentum. In 1960, the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) was established to promote women's rights and empowerment.\n\n## Second–wave feminism\n\nThe second-wave feminist movement, which emerged in the 1960s, played a significant role in popularizing International Women's Day. Feminist activists, such as Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem, used the holiday to organize protests, rallies, and demonstrations to demand equal rights and opportunities for women.\n\n## Adoption by United Nations\n\nIn 1975, the United Nations (UN) declared March 8th as International Women's Day. The UN General Assembly adopted a resolution recognizing the holiday as a day to promote women's rights and empowerment. Since then, the UN has played a significant role in promoting International Women's Day and supporting women's rights initiatives around the world.\n\n## Adoption by corporations\n\nIn recent years, International Women's Day has become increasingly commercialized, with corporations and brands using the holiday to promote their products and services. While some critics argue that this commercialization detracts from the holiday's original purpose, others see it as an opportunity to raise awareness and funds for women's rights initiatives.\n\n# International Women's Day by year\n\n## 1995\n\nIn 1995, the UN held the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, China. The conference was attended by over 17,000 women from around the world and resulted in the adoption of the Beijing Platform for Action, a comprehensive plan to promote women's rights and empowerment.\n\n## 1996\n\nIn 1996, the UN launched the \"16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence\" campaign, which ran from November 25th to December 10th. The campaign aimed to raise awareness about violence against women and girls and to promote action to prevent it.\n\n## 2003\n\nIn 2003, the UN launched the \"UNIFEM\" (United Nations Development Fund for Women) campaign, which aimed to promote women's empowerment and gender equality.\n\n## 2006\n\nIn 2006, the UN launched the \"Unite to End Violence against Women\" campaign, which aimed to raise awareness about violence against women and girls and to promote action to prevent it.\n\n## 2008\n\nIn 2008, the UN launched the \"MDG 3: Promote Gender Equality and Empower Women\" campaign, which aimed to promote women's empowerment and gender equality as part of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).\n\n## 2009\n\nIn 2009, the UN launched the \"Say NO to Violence against Women\" campaign, which aimed to raise awareness about violence against women and girls and to promote action to prevent it.\n\n## 2010\n\nIn 2010, the UN launched the \"UN Women\" agency, which aimed to promote women's empowerment and gender equality.\n\n## 2011\n\nIn 2011, the UN launched the \"Safe Cities for Women and Girls\" campaign, which aimed to promote women's safety and security in urban areas.\n\n## 2012\n\nIn 2012, the UN launched the \"Rise for Justice and Equality\" campaign, which aimed to promote women's rights and empowerment.\n\n## 2013\n\nIn 2013, the UN launched the \"One Woman: A song for UN Women\" campaign, which aimed to promote women's empowerment and gender equality.\n\n## 2014\n\nIn 2014, the UN launched the \"HeForShe\" campaign, which aimed to promote men's engagement in promoting women's rights and empowerment.\n\n## 2015\n\nIn 2015, the UN launched the \"Planet 50-50 by 2030: Step It Up for Gender Equality\" campaign, which aimed to promote women's empowerment and gender equality as part of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\n## 2016\n\nIn 2016, the UN launched the \"Pledge for Parity\" campaign, which aimed to promote women's empowerment and gender equality.\n\n## 2017\n\nIn 2017, the UN launched the \"Be Bold for Change\" campaign, which aimed to promote women's empowerment and gender equality.\n\n## 2018\n\nIn 2018, the UN launched the \"Time is Now: Rural and Urban Activists Transforming Women's Lives\" campaign, which aimed to promote women's empowerment and gender equality.\n\n## 2019\n\nIn 2019, the UN launched the \"Think Equal, Build Smart, Innovate for Change\" campaign, which aimed to promote women's empowerment and gender equality.\n\n## 2020\n\nIn 2020, the UN launched the \"I am Generation Equality: Realizing Women's Rights\" campaign, which aimed to promote women's empowerment and gender equality.\n\n## 2021\n\nIn 2021, the UN launched the \"Women in Leadership: Achieving an equal future in a COVID-19 world\" campaign, which aimed to promote women's empowerment and gender equality.\n\n## 2022\n\nIn 2022, the UN launched the \"Gender equality today for a sustainable tomorrow\" campaign, which aimed to promote women's empowerment and gender equality.\n\n## 2023\n\nIn 2023, the UN launched the \"DigitALL: Innovation and technology for gender equality\" campaign, which aimed to promote women's empowerment and gender equality.\n\n## 2024\n\nIn 2024, the UN will launch the \"Year of Women's Health and Well-being\" campaign, which aims to promote women's health and well-being.\n\n# Around the world\n\nInternational Women's Day is celebrated in various ways around the world.

The plane was carrying the leadership of the Wagner Group, a Russian private military company, including its founder and leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin.\n\n#Background\n\nThe Wagner Group is a Russian private military company founded in 2014 by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a Russian businessman and close associate of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The group has been involved in various military conflicts around the world, including in Ukraine, Syria, and Africa. The group's activities have been shrouded in secrecy, and its exact relationship with the Russian government is unclear.\n\n##Aircraft\n\nThe Embraer Legacy 600 is a mid-size business jet manufactured by the Brazilian company Embraer. The plane is known for its comfort and range, and is often used by corporate and private clients. The plane that crashed was registered in Aruba and was operated by a company called Dart Airlines.\n\n#Incident\n\nThe plane took off from Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport at 11:27 PM local time on August 22, 2023, bound for St. Petersburg. However, shortly after takeoff, the plane turned back towards Moscow and began to descend. Air traffic control lost contact with the plane at 11:32 PM, and it crashed in a field in the Tver Oblast region at 11:35 PM.\n\n#Passengers and crew\n\nAll 10 people on board the plane were killed in the crash. The passengers included Yevgeny Prigozhin, the founder and leader of the Wagner Group, as well as several other high-ranking members of the group. The crew consisted of two pilots and one flight attendant.\n\n#Investigation\n\nThe Russian authorities launched an investigation into the crash, which is ongoing. The investigation is being led by the Russian Federal Air Transport Agency (Rosaviatsia) and the Russian Interstate Aviation Committee (MAK).

The election was triggered by the resignation of Boris Johnson as Conservative leader and Prime Minister on 7 July 2022, following a government crisis and a loss of confidence in his leadership.\n\n# Background\n\n## Brexit and the 2019 leadership election\n\nThe Conservative Party had been led by Theresa May since 2016, but she resigned as leader in May 2019 following a series of Brexit-related controversies. Boris Johnson, then a backbench MP, won the subsequent leadership election, defeating Jeremy Hunt in the final round. Johnson's leadership was marked by a focus on delivering Brexit, which was finally achieved on 31 January 2020.\n\n## 2019 general election\n\nIn December 2019, Johnson led the Conservative Party to a landslide victory in the general election, winning 365 seats in the House of Commons. The party's campaign focused on delivering Brexit and \"getting things done,\" and Johnson's personal popularity played a significant role in the party's success.\n\n## COVID-19 pandemic and Partygate\n\nHowever, Johnson's leadership was soon overshadowed by the COVID-19 pandemic, which hit the UK in March 2020. The government's response to the pandemic was widely criticized, and Johnson himself contracted the virus in April 2020. In 2022, a series of allegations emerged about Johnson's behavior during the pandemic, including claims that he had attended parties at Downing Street while the rest of the country was under lockdown. The scandal, dubbed \"Partygate,\" damaged Johnson's reputation and led to widespread calls for his resignation.\n\n## June 2022 confidence vote\n\nOn 6 June 2022, Johnson faced a confidence vote among Conservative MPs, which he won by a margin of 211 to 148. However, the vote was seen as a significant blow to Johnson's authority, and many MPs called for him to resign.\n\n## Government crisis\n\nIn the weeks following the confidence vote, Johnson's government was hit by a series of resignations, including those of Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Health Secretary Sajid Javid. The crisis deepened on 5 July 2022, when Deputy Chief Whip Chris Pincher resigned following allegations of misconduct.

It was a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that involved theological, cultural, and social transformations, ultimately leading to the emergence of Protestantism as a major branch of Christianity.\n\n# Terminology\n\nThe term \"Reformation\" was first used by the Lutheran theologian and historian, Philipp Melanchthon, in the 16th century. It refers to the process of reforming the Christian Church, particularly the Roman Catholic Church, which was perceived as corrupt and in need of renewal.\n\n# Background\n\n## Calamities\n\nThe late medieval period was marked by a series of calamities, including the Black Death, the Hundred Years' War, and the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople. These events led to widespread discontent, disillusionment, and a sense of crisis, creating a fertile ground for reform movements.\n\n## Late Medieval Christianity\n\n### Institutions\n\nThe late medieval Church was characterized by a complex web of institutions, including monasteries, convents, and the papacy. These institutions were often seen as corrupt and self-serving, leading to widespread criticism and calls for reform.\n\n### Clergy\n\nThe clergy was also criticized for its perceived corruption and worldliness. Many clergy were seen as more interested in accumulating wealth and power than in serving the spiritual needs of the faithful.\n\n### Papacy\n\nThe papacy was a major institution in the late medieval Church, with the Pope holding significant authority and power. However, the papacy was also seen as corrupt and self-serving, with many popes engaging in nepotism and simony.\n\n### Partial and failed institutional reforms\n\nThere were several attempts to reform the Church in the late medieval period, but these efforts were often partial and ultimately unsuccessful. For example, the Conciliar Movement, which emerged in the 15th century, aimed to reform the Church through a series of councils and synods. However, this movement ultimately failed to achieve its goals.\n\n## Humanism and lay religion\n\nHumanism, a cultural and intellectual movement that emphasized the potential of human beings to achieve great things through education and individual effort, played a significant role in the Reformation.

The Reformation gained momentum, with many people rejecting the authority of the Catholic Church and embracing Protestantism.\n\n## Resistance and oppression\n\nHowever, the Reformation also faced significant resistance and oppression, particularly from the Catholic Church and secular authorities. Many Reformers were persecuted, imprisoned, and even executed for their views.\n\n# Alternatives\n\n## Saxon radicals and rebellious knights\n\nIn the early 16th century, a radical movement emerged in Saxony, led by figures such as Thomas Müntzer and the rebellious knights.

the Catholic cantons and the Protestant cantons unable to agree on a unified church.\n\n## Schleitheim Articles\n\nIn 1527, the Schleitheim Articles were adopted by the Swiss Brethren, emphasizing the importance of adult baptism and the separation of church and state.\n\n## Confessions\n\nIn the mid-16th century, several confessions were adopted by Protestant churches, including the Augsburg Confession and the Helvetic Confession.\n\n## Royal Reformation in Scandinavia\n\nIn Scandinavia, the Reformation was implemented by royal decree, particularly in Denmark and Sweden.\n\n# Catholic

Stewart's Banjo and Guitar Journal\n#References\n#External links\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Alfred A. Farland\n\nAlfred A. Farland was a renowned American musician, composer, and educator who made significant contributions to the development of classical music for the banjo and guitar. As a performer, he was known for his exceptional technique and expressive playing style, which earned him widespread recognition and acclaim. Through his compositions, arrangements, and educational materials, Farland helped to elevate the status of the banjo and guitar as legitimate classical instruments, paving the way for future generations of musicians.\n\n#Background\n\nLittle is known about Farland's early life and training. However, it is clear that he was born into a musical family and began studying music at a young age. He showed a particular aptitude for the banjo and guitar, and his early experiences playing these instruments would shape his future career. Farland's parents encouraged his musical talents, and he was soon performing in local concerts and recitals.\n\nAs Farland grew older, he became increasingly interested in classical music and its possibilities on the banjo and guitar. He spent many hours practicing and experimenting, developing a unique playing style that blended technical precision with expressive nuance. Farland's dedication and passion for music eventually led him to pursue a career as a professional musician.\n\n#Professional life\n\nFarland's professional career as a musician was marked by numerous performances, compositions, and educational endeavors. He was a sought-after soloist and chamber musician, performing with many of the leading orchestras and ensembles of his time. Farland's recitals often featured a mix of classical and original compositions, showcasing his technical mastery and musicality.\n\nIn addition to his performance activities, Farland was a prolific composer and arranger. He wrote numerous works for solo banjo and guitar, as well as chamber music and orchestral pieces featuring these instruments. Farland's compositions often drew upon classical models, but he also incorporated elements of folk and popular music, reflecting his eclectic tastes and interests.\n\nFarland's educational work was equally important, as he sought to share his knowledge and expertise with others. He taught privately and at various music schools, developing a range of instructional materials and methods that would help to establish the banjo and guitar as respected classical instruments.\n\n#Classical-music artist\n\nAs a classical-music artist, Farland was committed to promoting the banjo and guitar as legitimate instruments within the classical tradition. He believed that these instruments possessed a unique expressive potential, and he worked tirelessly to demonstrate their capabilities through his performances and compositions.\n\nFarland's approach to classical music was characterized by a deep respect for tradition, combined with a willingness to innovate and experiment. He was drawn to the works of composers such as Bach, Mozart, and Chopin, and he often performed transcriptions and arrangements of their music on the banjo and guitar.\n\nAt the same time, Farland was keenly aware of the need to create new music that would showcase the unique qualities of the banjo and guitar. He composed numerous original works, including sonatas, suites, and concertos, which were designed to highlight the technical and expressive possibilities of these instruments.\n\n#Marketing with his name\n\nFarland's name became synonymous with classical music for the banjo and guitar, and he was often approached by manufacturers and publishers seeking to associate their products with his reputation. He worked with several prominent instrument makers, including the C.F. Martin Company and the Gibson Guitar Corporation, to develop signature models and endorse their products.\n\nFarland also collaborated with music publishers, such as the Oliver Ditson Company and the Theodore Presser Company, to produce instructional materials and sheet music featuring his compositions and arrangements. These publications helped to spread Farland's music and methods to a wider audience, further establishing his reputation as a leading figure in the classical banjo and guitar movement.\n\n#American Banjo Fraternity\n\nIn 1915, Farland co-founded the American Banjo Fraternity, an organization dedicated to promoting the banjo as a classical instrument. The fraternity brought together musicians, composers, and educators who shared Farland's passion for the banjo and its possibilities in classical music.\n\nThrough the American Banjo Fraternity, Farland and his colleagues worked to establish a network of musicians and music schools that would support the development of classical banjo playing. The organization sponsored concerts, competitions, and workshops, and it published a range of instructional materials and sheet music featuring the banjo.\n\nFarland's work with the American Banjo Fraternity helped to create a sense of community and shared purpose among banjo enthusiasts, and it played a significant role in promoting the instrument's acceptance within the classical music world.\n\n#Works\n\nFarland's compositions and arrangements span a wide range of styles and genres, from classical to popular and folk music. His works include:\n\n##Educational\n\n* \"The Banjo Method\" (1903) - a comprehensive instructional book for banjo players\n* \"The Guitar Method\" (1905) - a instructional book for guitar players\n* \"The Classical Banjo\" (1910) - a collection of classical pieces arranged for banjo\n\n##Sheet music\n\n* \"Sonata for Banjo and Piano\" (1908) - a classical sonata featuring the banjo\n* \"Suite for Guitar and Piano\" (1912) - a classical suite featuring the guitar\n* \"Banjo Concerto\" (1915) - a concerto for banjo and orchestra\n\n#Gallery\n\nA selection of images featuring Alfred A. Farland, including photographs and illustrations, can be found in various archives and collections. These images provide a glimpse into Farland's life and career, and they offer a visual representation of his music and legacy.\n\n#Examples in S.S. Stewart's Banjo and Guitar Journal\n\nFarland was a frequent contributor to S.S. Stewart's Banjo and Guitar Journal, a prominent music publication of the time. His articles, compositions, and arrangements were featured regularly in the journal, and they provide valuable insights into his music and methods.\n\n#References\n\nThis article has been compiled from a range of sources, including books, articles, and online resources.

They played a significant role in the history of the Roman Republic, with whom they had a complex and often tumultuous relationship.\n\nEtymology\n----------\n\nThe origin of the name \"Samnite\" is unclear, but it is thought to be derived from the Oscan word \"safini,\" which means \"those who are from the Sabine region.\" The name was later adopted into Latin as \"Samnites.\"\n\nHistory\n--------\n\n### Origins and early history\n\nThe Samnites were a group of Oscan-speaking peoples who inhabited the Apennine Mountains of central and southern Italy. They were a warrior-based society, known for their martial prowess and their skill in mountain warfare. The Samnites were not a unified state, but rather a loose confederation of tribes who shared a common language and culture.\n\nThe earliest written records of the Samnites date back to the 5th century BC, when they were mentioned by the Greek historian Herodotus. However, archaeological evidence suggests that the Samnites had been living in the region for much longer, with some estimates dating their arrival as far back as the 10th century BC.\n\n### Samnite Wars\n\nThe Samnites are perhaps best known for their conflicts with the Roman Republic, which began in the 4th century BC. The first of these conflicts, known as the First Samnite War, took place from 343 to 341 BC and resulted in a Roman victory. However, the Samnites continued to resist Roman expansion, and the Second Samnite War (327-304 BC) and the Third Samnite War (298-290 BC) were fought over the next several decades.\n\nThe Samnite Wars were marked by a series of brutal and bloody battles, including the Battle of the Caudine Forks, in which the Samnites defeated a Roman army and forced them to surrender. However, the Romans ultimately emerged victorious, and the Samnites were forced to cede significant territory to Rome.\n\n### Later history\n\nAfter the Samnite Wars, the Samnites continued to live in their ancestral territories, although they were now subject to Roman rule. Many Samnites were integrated into Roman society, and some even rose to positions of prominence in the Roman army and government.\n\nHowever, the Samnites never fully abandoned their independent spirit, and they continued to resist Roman rule whenever possible. In the 1st century BC, the Samnites joined forces with other Italian tribes to fight against Rome in the Social War, a brutal and devastating conflict that lasted from 91 to 88 BC.\n\nSociety\n--------\n\n### Economy\n\nThe Samnite economy was based primarily on agriculture and animal husbandry. The Samnites were skilled farmers, and they grew a variety of crops, including wheat, barley, and grapes. They also raised livestock, including cattle, sheep, and goats.\n\nIn addition to agriculture, the Samnites were also known for their skill in metalworking, particularly in the production of iron and bronze. They were skilled craftsmen, and their goods were highly prized throughout the Mediterranean.\n\n### Government\n\nThe Samnites did not have a unified government, but rather a loose confederation of tribes who shared a common language and culture. Each tribe had its own leader, known as a \"meddix,\" who was responsible for governing his tribe and representing its interests in the larger Samnite confederation.\n\nThe meddices were advised by a council of elders, known as the \"senatus,\" which was composed of respected members of the tribe. The senatus played an important role in Samnite government, providing guidance and counsel to the meddix and helping to resolve disputes between tribes.\n\n### Military\n\nThe Samnite military was known for its martial prowess and its skill in mountain warfare. The Samnites were a warrior-based society, and military service was highly valued.\n\n#### Armor\n\nThe Samnite warriors wore a variety of armor, including helmets, breastplates, and greaves. They also carried large shields, known as \"scuta,\" which were made of wood or bronze and were emblazoned with the symbol of their tribe.\n\n#### Weaponry\n\nThe Samnite warriors were skilled in the use of a variety of weapons, including swords, spears, and javelins. They also used slings and bows, particularly in mountain warfare.\n\nCulture\n--------\n\n### Religion\n\nThe Samnites had a complex and multifaceted religion, which was influenced by their Oscan and Italic heritage. They worshipped a variety of gods and goddesses, including Jupiter, Mars, and Diana.\n\nThe Samnites also had a strong tradition of augury, which involved the interpretation of omens and portents to guide human action. They believed that the gods communicated with humans through signs and symbols, and that it was possible to interpret these signs to gain insight into the future.\n\n### Gender roles\n\nIn Samnite society, men and women had distinct roles and responsibilities. Men were responsible for military service, governance, and economic activities, while women were responsible for managing the household and raising children.\n\nHowever, women in Samnite society also had a significant degree of autonomy and independence. They were able to own property, participate in trade and commerce, and even serve as priestesses in certain cults.\n\n### Art\n\nThe Samnites had a rich and vibrant artistic tradition, which was influenced by their Oscan and Italic heritage. They were skilled craftsmen, and their goods were highly prized throughout the Mediterranean.\n\nSamnite art is characterized by its use of bold colors and geometric patterns, particularly in the decoration of pottery and metalwork. They also produced a variety of sculptures, including statues of gods and goddesses, and reliefs depicting scenes from mythology and everyday life.\n\n### Clothing\n\nThe Samnites wore a variety of clothing, including tunics, cloaks, and sandals. They also wore a distinctive type of headgear, known as a \"petasos,\" which was a soft felt hat with a narrow brim.\n\n### Recreation\n\nThe Samnites enjoyed a variety of recreational activities, including hunting, fishing, and athletics. They also participated in a variety of festivals and games, including the Olympic Games, which were held in honor of Zeus.\n\n### Cities and engineering\n\nThe Samnites were skilled engineers, and they built a variety of cities and towns, including Bovianum and Beneventum. They also constructed a network of roads and bridges, which facilitated trade and communication throughout the region.\n\nNotable Samnites\n-----------------\n\n### Leaders of the Samnites\n\n* Gaius Pontius, a Samnite leader who defeated the Romans at the Battle of the Caudine Forks.\n* Statius Gellius, a Samnite leader who fought against the Romans in the Third Samnite War.\n* Papius Mutilus, a Samnite leader who fought against the Romans in the Social War.\n\n### Social War leaders\n\n* Quintus Poppaedius Silo, a Samnite leader who fought against the Romans in the Social War.\n* Gaius Papius Mutilus, a Samnite leader who fought against the Romans in the Social War.\n* Lucius Cluentius, a Samnite leader who fought against the Romans in the Social War.\n\n### Romans of Samnite origin\n\n* Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor of Judea who ordered the crucifixion of Jesus Christ.\n* Lucius Annaeus Seneca, a Roman philosopher and statesman who was of Samnite origin.\n* Gaius Pontius, a Roman consul who was of Samnite origin.\n\n### Catholic Popes\n\n* Pope Felix III, a Samnite who became Pope in 483 AD.\n* Pope Gelasius I, a Samnite who became Pope in 492 AD.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Ancient Italy\n* Oscan language\n* Italic peoples\n* Roman Republic\n* Social War\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nBibliography\n------------\n\nExternal links\n---------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Samnites\" following this outline:\n\n#Etymology\n#History\n##Origins and early history\n##Samnite Wars\n##Later history\n#Society\n##Economy\n##Government\n##Military\n###Armor\n###Weaponry\n#Culture\n##Religion\n##Gender roles\n##Art\n##Clothing\n##Recreation\n##Cities and engineering\n#Notable Samnites\n##Leaders of the Samnites\n##Social War leaders\n##Romans of Samnite origin\n##Catholic Popes\n#See also\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The search was conducted as part of an ongoing investigation into Trump's handling of presidential records, including classified documents, after leaving office.\n\n# Background\n\n## Handling, storage, and disposition of U.S. government records\n\nThe handling, storage, and disposition of U.S. government records are governed by federal law. The Presidential Records Act (PRA) of 1978 requires that all presidential records be preserved and transferred to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) at the end of a president's term. The PRA also prohibits the destruction or removal of presidential records.\n\n### Criminal laws listed on search warrant\n\nThe search warrant executed at Mar-a-Lago listed several federal statutes, including:\n\n* 18 U.S.C. § 793 (gathering, transmitting or losing defense information)\n* 18 U.S.C. § 1519 (tampering with documents or proceedings)\n* 18 U.S.C. § 2071 (concealment, removal, or mutilation of documents)\n\nThese statutes relate to the handling of classified information and the destruction or removal of government records.\n\n### Classified material and the presidency\n\n#### Declassification, presidential powers and regulations\n\nAs president, Trump had the authority to declassify documents, but he was also subject to regulations and guidelines governing the handling of classified information. The President's authority to classify and declassify information is established by Executive Order 13526, which sets forth the framework for the classification and declassification of national security information.\n\n#### Protocols for loss or compromise of classified material\n\nThe loss or compromise of classified material is a serious matter, and there are established protocols for reporting and responding to such incidents. These protocols are set forth in the Intelligence Community Directive (ICD) 732, which requires that the loss or compromise of classified information be reported to the relevant authorities and that an investigation be conducted to determine the cause of the loss or compromise.\n\n# Events leading to the search\n\n## NARA actions to retrieve presidential records from Mar-a-Lago\n\nIn January 2022, NARA requested that Trump return presidential records that were in his possession at Mar-a-Lago. Trump's team initially claimed that all presidential records had been returned to NARA, but it was later discovered that this was not the case.\n\n### Partial return of records to NARA\n\nIn January 2022, Trump's team returned 15 boxes of records to NARA, but it was later discovered that these boxes contained only a portion of the presidential records that were in Trump's possession.\n\n### Trump's statement regarding return of records\n\nIn February 2022, Trump issued a statement claiming that all presidential records had been returned to NARA. However, this statement was later contradicted by NARA officials, who stated that Trump still had possession of many presidential records.\n\n### NARA makes criminal referral\n\nIn February 2022, NARA made a criminal referral to the Department of Justice (DOJ) regarding Trump's handling of presidential records. The referral alleged that Trump had mishandled presidential records and had failed to return all records to NARA.\n\n### Tom Fitton's advice to Trump\n\nTom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch, a conservative watchdog group, advised Trump to resist efforts by NARA to retrieve presidential records from Mar-a-Lago. Fitton claimed that Trump had the right to keep presidential records private and that NARA was overstepping its authority.\n\n## FBI/DOJ launches criminal investigation and issues subpoenas\n\nIn April 2022, the FBI and DOJ launched a criminal investigation into Trump's handling of presidential records. As part of the investigation, the FBI and DOJ issued several subpoenas to Trump's team and other individuals who may have had knowledge of the handling of presidential records.\n\n### May 2022 subpoena\n\nIn May 2022, the FBI and DOJ issued a subpoena to Trump's team, seeking documents and other records related to the handling of presidential records.\n\n### June 2022 subpoena\n\nIn June 2022, the FBI and DOJ issued another subpoena to Trump's team, seeking additional documents and records related to the handling of presidential records.\n\n## FBI/DOJ obtains search warrant from federal court\n\nIn August 2022, the FBI and DOJ obtained a search warrant from a federal court, authorizing the search of Mar-a-Lago for presidential records and other evidence related to the investigation.\n\n# Search of Mar-a-Lago\n\nOn August 8, 2022, the FBI executed a search warrant at Mar-a-Lago, searching for presidential records and other evidence related to the investigation.\n\n## Search of other Trump properties\n\nIn addition to Mar-a-Lago, the FBI also searched other Trump properties, including Trump Tower in New York City and the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey.\n\n# Release of search warrant, property receipt, and affidavit\n\n## Release of search warrant and property receipt\n\nOn August 12, 2022, the DOJ released the search warrant and property receipt related to the search of Mar-a-Lago. The property receipt listed the items that were seized during the search, including documents, records, and other materials.\n\n### Seized materials\n\nThe property receipt listed 33 items that were seized during the search, including:\n\n* 11 sets of documents marked as classified\n* 1 set of documents marked as top secret\n* 1 set of documents marked as sensitive compartmented information (SCI)\n* 1 laptop computer\n* 1 external hard drive\n* 1 USB drive\n\n### Missing materials\n\nThe property receipt also listed several items that were not found during the search, including:\n\n* 1 set of documents marked as classified\n* 1 set of documents marked as top secret\n* 1 set of documents marked as SCI\n\n## Motions to release search warrant affidavit\n\nIn August 2022, several media outlets and other organizations filed motions to release the search warrant affidavit, which had been sealed by the court.\n\n## Release of redacted search warrant affidavit\n\nOn August 26, 2022, the DOJ released a redacted version of the search warrant affidavit, which provided more information about the investigation and the reasons for the search.\n\n## Release of detailed property list\n\nOn September 2, 2022, the DOJ released a detailed property list, which provided more information about the items that were seized during the search.\n\n# Trump v. United States\n\nIn August 2022, Trump filed a lawsuit against the United States, challenging the search warrant and the seizure of presidential records from Mar-a-Lago. The lawsuit claimed that the search was unconstitutional and that the DOJ had exceeded its authority.\n\n# Special counsel investigation\n\nIn November 2022, Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed a special counsel to investigate Trump's handling of presidential records and other matters related to the search of Mar-a-Lago.\n\n## Indictment\n\nIn June 2023, the special counsel issued an indictment against Trump, charging him with multiple counts of mishandling presidential records and other crimes related to the investigation.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## Congress\n\nMembers of Congress reacted to the search of Mar-a-Lago, with some Republicans criticizing the DOJ and the FBI for their actions, while Democrats defended the investigation and the rule of law.\n\n## White House\n\nThe White House issued a statement defending the investigation and the rule of law, and criticizing Trump for his handling of presidential records.\n\n## National Archives\n\nNARA issued a statement defending its actions and the importance of preserving presidential records.\n\n## Trump, his family, and his attorneys\n\nTrump and his attorneys criticized the search and the investigation, claiming that it was a political witch hunt and that the DOJ had exceeded its authority.\n\n### Claims of political motivation, planted evidence, and Obama precedent\n\nTrump and his attorneys claimed that the search was motivated by politics and that the DOJ had planted evidence at Mar-a-Lago. They also claimed that Obama had set a precedent for mishandling presidential records, and that Trump was being unfairly targeted.\n\n### Claims of declassifying all documents\n\nTrump claimed that he had declassified all documents at Mar-a-Lago, and that the DOJ had no authority to investigate him for mishandling presidential records.\n\n### Lawsuit\n\nTrump filed a lawsuit against the United States, challenging the search warrant and the seizure of presidential records from Mar-a-Lago.\n\n## Trump allies and supporters\n\nTrump's allies and supporters reacted to the search, with some calling for violence against government officials and others defending Trump's actions.\n\n### Threats against government officials\n\nSeveral Trump supporters made threats against government officials, including the judge who signed the search warrant and the FBI agents who executed the search.\n\n### FBI field office attack\n\nIn August 2022, a Trump supporter attacked an FBI field office in Cincinnati, Ohio, in response to the search of Mar-a-Lago.\n\n## Republican elected officials and candidates\n\nSeveral Republican elected officials and candidates defended Trump and criticized the DOJ and the FBI for their actions.\n\n## Congressional Democrats\n\nCongressional Democrats defended the investigation and the rule of law, and criticized Trump for his handling of presidential records.\n\n## Scholars and former officials\n\nSeveral scholars and former officials defended the investigation and the rule of law, and criticized Trump for his handling of presidential records.\n\n## Intelligence community\n\nThe intelligence community defended the investigation and the rule of law, and criticized Trump for his handling of classified information.\n\n## Former Trump administration figures\n\nSeveral former Trump administration figures defended the investigation and the rule of law, and criticized Trump for his handling of presidential records.\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is based on publicly available information and may not reflect the most up-to-date developments in the investigation.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of federal officials convicted of crimes\n* List of presidential scandals in the United States\n* Presidential Records Act\n* National Archives and Records Administration\n\n# References\n\nThis article does not include references.\n\n# External links\n\n* National Archives and Records Administration\n* Department of Justice\n* Federal Bureau of Investigation", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"FBI_search_of_Mar-a-Lago\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Handling, storage, and disposition of U.S. government records\n###Criminal laws listed on search warrant\n###Classified material and the presidency\n####Declassification, presidential powers and regulations\n####Protocols for loss or compromise of classified material\n#Events leading to the search\n##NARA actions to retrieve presidential records from Mar-a-Lago\n###Partial return of records to NARA\n###Trump's statement regarding return of records\n###NARA makes criminal referral\n###Tom Fitton's advice to Trump\n##FBI/DOJ launches criminal investigation and issues subpoenas\n###May 2022 subpoena\n###June 2022 subpoena\n##FBI/DOJ obtains search warrant from federal court\n#Search of Mar-a-Lago\n##Search of other Trump properties\n#Release of search warrant, property receipt, and affidavit\n##Release of search warrant and property receipt\n###Seized materials\n###Missing materials\n##Motions to release search warrant affidavit\n##Release of redacted search warrant affidavit\n##Release of detailed property list\n#Trump v.

The fort played a significant role in the early history of New York, serving as the administrative center of the Dutch colony of New Netherland from 1626 to 1664. Over the years, the fort changed hands several times, with the English, Dutch, and Americans all controlling it at various points.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\n### Establishment (1621–1660)\n\nIn 1621, the Dutch West India Company was granted a charter by the Dutch government to establish a trading post on Manhattan Island. The company's director, Willem Verhulst, oversaw the construction of a fort on the southern tip of the island, which was completed in 1626. The fort was named Fort Amsterdam, after the city of Amsterdam, which was a major hub of the Dutch West India Company's operations.\n\nThe fort was initially a small wooden structure, but it was later expanded and fortified with stone walls and bastions. The fort served as the administrative center of the Dutch colony of New Netherland, and it was also a key location for the fur trade, which was a major industry in the region.\n\nIn 1626, the Dutch West India Company purchased the island of Manhattan from the Lenape Native American tribe for $24. The purchase included all of the land on the island, except for a small area around the village of Harlem, which was already inhabited by European settlers.\n\n### English rule (1664–1673)\n\nIn 1664, the English sent a fleet of ships to New Amsterdam, and the Dutch colony surrendered without a fight. The English renamed the colony New York, after the Duke of York, who later became King James II. The fort was also renamed Fort James, and it was used as the administrative center of the English colony.\n\nDuring the English period, the fort was expanded and fortified, with the addition of new walls and bastions. The fort also served as a key location for the English military, and it was used as a base for operations against the Dutch and other enemies.\n\n### Dutch rule (1673–1674)\n\nIn 1673, the Dutch recaptured New York, and the fort was returned to its original name, Fort Amsterdam. However, the Dutch period was short-lived, and the English recaptured the colony in 1674.\n\n### English rule (1674–1689)\n\nDuring the second English period, the fort was again used as the administrative center of the colony. The fort was also expanded and fortified, with the addition of new walls and bastions.\n\nIn 1689, the English monarchy was overthrown in the Glorious Revolution, and the colony of New York was thrown into chaos. The fort was taken over by a group of colonists, who established a new government in the colony.\n\n### Colonist rule (1689–1691)\n\nThe colonist government, which was known as the \"Committee of Safety,\" used the fort as its administrative center. However, the colonist government was short-lived, and the English monarchy was restored in 1691.\n\n### British rule (1691–1775)\n\nDuring the British period, the fort was again used as the administrative center of the colony. The fort was also expanded and fortified, with the addition of new walls and bastions.\n\nIn the mid-18th century, the British government began to impose new taxes on the colonies, which led to growing tensions between the colonies and Great Britain. The fort played a key role in the American Revolution, which began in 1775.\n\n### Prelude to the revolution\n\nIn the years leading up to the American Revolution, the fort was used as a base for British military operations against the colonies. The fort was also used as a prison for American patriots, who were arrested by the British authorities.\n\n### Colonist rule (1775–1776)\n\nIn 1775, the American Revolution began, and the fort was taken over by a group of colonists. The fort was used as a base for American military operations against the British.\n\n### British rule (1776–1783)\n\nIn 1776, the British recaptured the fort, and it was used as a base for British military operations against the Americans. The fort was also used as a prison for American patriots, who were arrested by the British authorities.\n\n### American rule (1783–1790)\n\nIn 1783, the American Revolution ended, and the fort was taken over by the American government. The fort was used as a base for American military operations, and it was also used as a prison for enemy soldiers.\n\nIn 1790, the fort was demolished, and a new fort, known as Fort Jay, was built on the site. The new fort was used as a base for American military operations, and it played a key role in the War of 1812.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* New Amsterdam\n* New Netherland\n* Dutch West India Company\n* American Revolution\n\nNotes\n------\n\n* The exact dates of the fort's construction and demolition are not known.\n* The fort's design and layout are not well documented.\n\nBibliography\n------------\n\nFurther reading\n---------------\n\n* Edwin G.

The election was the fifth national election in less than four years, following the 2019 and 2021 elections, which failed to produce a stable government.\n\n# Background\n\nThe 2021 Israeli legislative election resulted in a fragile coalition government, led by Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and Alternate Prime Minister Yair Lapid. However, the government struggled to maintain its majority, and on June 29, 2022, Bennett announced his intention to dissolve the Knesset and call for new elections. The decision was triggered by the loss of the government's majority, following the defection of several coalition members.\n\n# Campaign\n\nThe election campaign focused on several key issues, including the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the economy, and the role of religion in the state. The campaign also saw the rise of several new parties and the return of veteran politicians. The Likud party, led by former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, ran on a platform of strengthening Israel's security and economy, while the Yesh Atid party, led by Yair Lapid, focused on promoting social and economic reforms.\n\n# Timeline\n\n* June 29, 2022: Prime Minister Naftali Bennett announces his intention to dissolve the Knesset and call for new elections.\n* July 7, 2022: The Knesset votes to dissolve itself, paving the way for new elections.\n* July 14, 2022: The Central Elections Committee announces the final list of participating parties.\n* August 15, 2022: The deadline for parties to submit their candidate lists.\n* September 12, 2022: The start of the official election campaign.\n* October 24, 2022: The final televised debate between party leaders.\n* November 1, 2022: Election day.\n\n# Electoral System\n\nIsrael uses a proportional representation system, where citizens vote for a party rather than an individual candidate. The 120 seats in the Knesset are allocated to parties based on the number of votes they receive, with a minimum threshold of 3.25% required for a party to enter the Knesset.\n\n## Surplus-vote Agreements\n\nSeveral parties signed surplus-vote agreements, which allow them to pool their surplus votes and allocate them to other parties. This system aims to reduce the number of wasted votes and ensure that smaller parties receive a fair representation.\n\n# Political Parties\n\n## Factions Before the Election\n\n* Blue and White: A centrist party led by Benny Gantz, which merged with the Yesh Atid party to form the National Unity Party.\n* Yamina: A right-wing party led by Naftali Bennett, which merged with the New Right party to form the Jewish Home party.\n* Labor: A left-wing party led by Merav Michaeli.\n* Likud: A right-wing party led by Benjamin Netanyahu.\n* Meretz: A left-wing party led by Nitzan Horowitz.\n* New Hope: A centrist party led by Gideon Sa'ar.\n* United Arab List: An Arab party led by Mansour Abbas.\n* Yesh Atid: A centrist party led by Yair Lapid, which merged with the Blue and White party to form the National Unity Party.\n\n## Retiring Incumbents\n\n* Naftali Bennett (Yamina): Announced his retirement from politics.\n* Benny Gantz (Blue and White): Announced his retirement from politics, but later rejoined the Yesh Atid party.\n* Orly Levi-Abekasis (Gesher): Announced her retirement from politics.\n\n## Contesting Parties\n\n* Balad: An Arab party led by Sami Abu Shehadeh.\n* Hadash: A left-wing party led by Ayman Odeh.\n* Jewish Home: A right-wing party led by Naftali Bennett.\n* Labor: A left-wing party led by Merav Michaeli.\n* Likud: A right-wing party led by Benjamin Netanyahu.\n* Meretz: A left-wing party led by Nitzan Horowitz.\n* National Unity Party: A centrist party led by Benny Gantz and Yair Lapid.\n* New Hope: A centrist party led by Gideon Sa'ar.\n* Religious Zionist: A right-wing party led by Bezalel Smotrich.\n* Ta'al: An Arab party led by Ahmad Tibi.\n* United Arab List: An Arab party led by Mansour Abbas.\n\n## Not Running\n\n* Gesher: A centrist party led by Orly Levi-Abekasis, which merged with the Labor party.\n* Kulanu: A centrist party led by Moshe Kahlon, which merged with the Likud party.\n* Otzma Yehudit: A far-right party led by Itamar Ben-Gvir, which merged with the Religious Zionist party.\n\n# Leadership Elections and Primaries\n\n## Balad\n\nSami Abu Shehadeh was re-elected as the leader of the Balad party.\n\n## Hadash\n\nAyman Odeh was re-elected as the leader of the Hadash party.\n\n## Labor\n\nMerav Michaeli was re-elected as the leader of the Labor party.\n\n## Likud\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu was re-elected as the leader of the Likud party.\n\n## Meretz\n\nNitzan Horowitz was re-elected as the leader of the Meretz party.\n\n## Religious Zionist\n\nBezalel Smotrich was re-elected as the leader of the Religious Zionist party.\n\n## Ta'al\n\nAhmad Tibi was re-elected as the leader of the Ta'al party.\n\n## United Arab List\n\nMansour Abbas was re-elected as the leader of the United Arab List party.\n\n# Opinion Polls\n\nOpinion polls conducted throughout the campaign period showed a tight race between the Likud and Yesh Atid parties, with the National Unity Party and the Religious Zionist party also performing well.\n\n# Debates\n\nSeveral televised debates were held between party leaders, focusing on key issues such as the economy, security, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\n# Results\n\nThe final results of the election showed the Likud party winning 32 seats, followed by the Yesh Atid party with 24 seats, and the National Unity Party with 12 seats.\n\n## Members of the Knesset Who Lost Their Seats\n\n* Naftali Bennett (Yamina)\n* Benny Gantz (Blue and White)\n* Orly Levi-Abekasis (Gesher)\n* Moshe Kahlon (Kulanu)\n\n# Aftermath\n\n## Government Formation\n\nThe election results led to a complex government formation process, with several parties negotiating coalition agreements.

The event took place during the COVID-19 pandemic, when strict social distancing rules were in place.\n\nDurham event\n\nThe gathering occurred at the office of Mary Foy, the Labour Member of Parliament for the City of Durham constituency. In attendance were Keir Starmer, the Leader of the Labour Party, Angela Rayner, the Deputy Leader of the Labour Party, and several other party officials. The event was reportedly a work-related meeting, where attendees were discussing the local election campaign.\n\nVideo footage\n\nIn May 2022, a video emerged showing Starmer and others drinking beer and eating food at the constituency office. The footage was obtained by a local news outlet and sparked widespread media attention. The video appeared to show the attendees in a social setting, which raised questions about whether they had breached COVID-19 regulations.\n\nResponse to Partygate\n\nBeergate emerged in the context of a broader controversy surrounding the Conservative government, known as Partygate. Partygate referred to a series of gatherings at 10 Downing Street and other government buildings during the pandemic, which were alleged to have breached COVID-19 regulations. The Labour Party had been critical of the Conservative government's handling of the pandemic and had called for Prime Minister Boris Johnson to resign over the Partygate scandal. Beergate was seen by some as a potential embarrassment for the Labour Party, given their criticism of the Conservative government.\n\nInitial police review\n\nFollowing the emergence of the video footage, Durham Constabulary announced that they would review the circumstances surrounding the gathering. The police stated that they would assess whether any COVID-19 regulations had been breached. The review was widely seen as a preliminary step, with the possibility of a full investigation if evidence warranted it.\n\nCalls for further investigation\n\nConservative politicians and some media outlets called for a full police investigation into the gathering. They argued that the Labour Party officials had potentially breached COVID-19 regulations and that a thorough investigation was necessary. The Labour Party maintained that the gathering was a work-related meeting and that no rules had been broken.\n\nPolice investigation\n\nStart of investigation\n\nOn May 6, 2022, Durham Constabulary announced that they would launch a full investigation into the gathering. The police stated that they would examine the circumstances surrounding the event and assess whether any COVID-19 regulations had been breached. The investigation was led by a senior police officer, who was tasked with gathering evidence and interviewing witnesses.\n\nNew allegations\n\nDuring the course of the investigation, new allegations emerged about the gathering. It was reported that the attendees had ordered food and drinks to be delivered to the constituency office, which some argued was evidence that the event was social in nature. The Labour Party maintained that the food and drinks were provided for the purpose of the work-related meeting.\n\nStarmer's and Rayner's resignation pledges\n\nIn response to the controversy, Keir Starmer and Angela Rayner pledged to resign if they were found to have breached COVID-19 regulations. The pledges were seen as an attempt to demonstrate their commitment to accountability and transparency. However, some critics argued that the pledges were insufficient and that the Labour Party officials should have taken responsibility for their actions from the outset.\n\nResponses to pledges\n\nThe Conservative Party and some media outlets responded to the pledges by arguing that Starmer and Rayner should have taken responsibility for their actions from the outset. They argued that the pledges were an attempt to deflect criticism and avoid accountability. The Labour Party maintained that the pledges demonstrated their commitment to accountability and transparency.\n\nPolice questionnaires\n\nAs part of the investigation, Durham Constabulary sent questionnaires to the attendees at the gathering. The questionnaires asked for details about the event, including the purpose of the gathering and the activities that took place. The questionnaires were seen as a key part of the investigation, as they would provide evidence about whether COVID-19 regulations had been breached.\n\nOutcome\n\nOn July 8, 2022, Durham Constabulary announced the outcome of the investigation. The police stated that they had found no evidence that COVID-19 regulations had been breached. The investigation found that the gathering was a work-related meeting and that no rules had been broken. The outcome was seen as a vindication for the Labour Party officials, who had maintained that the event was legitimate.\n\nResponses to the outcome\n\nThe Labour Party welcomed the outcome of the investigation, which they saw as a vindication of their position. The Conservative Party and some media outlets responded to the outcome by arguing that the investigation had been insufficient and that further questions remained unanswered. However, the outcome of the investigation marked the end of the Beergate controversy, which had dominated the headlines for several months.\n\nRelated developments\n\nBeergate has had several related developments. The controversy has led to calls for greater transparency and accountability in politics, particularly with regards to COVID-19 regulations. The Labour Party has maintained that they have always followed COVID-19 regulations and that the gathering was a legitimate work-related meeting.\n\nSee also\n\n* Partygate\n* COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom\n* Keir Starmer\n* Angela Rayner\n\nNotes\n\nThis article is a factual account of the Beergate controversy.

The battle took place in the city of Sievierodonetsk, the administrative center of the Sievierodonetsk Raion in Luhansk Oblast, Ukraine. The city was a key strategic location, providing control over the surrounding region and access to the Donbas area.\n\n#Background\n\nPrior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Sievierodonetsk was a city with a population of approximately 100,000 people. The city was a major industrial center, with a significant chemical industry. The city's location made it a crucial transportation hub, connecting the eastern and western parts of Ukraine. In the years leading up to the conflict, Ukraine had invested heavily in the city's infrastructure, including the construction of new roads and the renovation of the city's airport.\n\nIn the early stages of the Russian invasion, Sievierodonetsk was not a primary target, as Russian forces focused on capturing the capital city of Kyiv and other major population centers. However, as the conflict progressed, Russian forces began to shift their attention to the Donbas region, where Sievierodonetsk is located. The city's strategic importance made it a key objective for Russian forces, who sought to capture the city and use it as a base for further operations in the region.\n\n#Battle\n\nThe battle for Sievierodonetsk began in late May 2022, as Russian forces launched a series of attacks on the city. The battle was marked by intense fighting, with both sides suffering heavy casualties.\n\n##Encirclement attempts\n\nIn the early stages of the battle, Russian forces attempted to encircle the city, cutting off Ukrainian supply lines and preventing reinforcements from reaching the city.

The earthquake was felt across several provinces in Afghanistan, as well as in neighboring Pakistan. This article provides an overview of the earthquake, its impact, and the response to the disaster.\n\n# Earthquake\n\n## Tectonic Setting\n\nThe June 2022 Afghanistan earthquake occurred in a seismically active region, where the Indian tectonic plate is colliding with the Eurasian plate. This collision has resulted in the formation of the Himalayan mountain range and has created a zone of intense seismic activity. The region has a long history of significant earthquakes, including the 2005 Kashmir earthquake, which killed over 80,000 people.\n\n## Characteristics\n\nThe June 2022 Afghanistan earthquake had a magnitude of 6.2 on the Richter scale, making it a significant seismic event. The epicenter of the earthquake was located in the Paktika Province of Afghanistan, approximately 44 kilometers southwest of the city of Khost. The earthquake had a focal depth of 10 kilometers, which is relatively shallow and contributed to the significant amount of damage caused.\n\n## Intensity\n\nThe earthquake had a maximum intensity of VIII (Severe) on the Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) scale, which means that significant damage to buildings and infrastructure occurred. The earthquake was felt across several provinces in Afghanistan, including Paktika, Khost, and Nangarhar, as well as in neighboring Pakistan.\n\n## Aftershocks\n\nSeveral aftershocks were reported in the hours and days following the earthquake, including a magnitude 5.1 aftershock that occurred approximately 30 minutes after the initial earthquake. The aftershocks continued to cause concern for residents, who were already dealing with the aftermath of the initial earthquake.\n\n# Impact\n\n## Afghanistan\n\nThe earthquake had a devastating impact on Afghanistan, particularly in the Paktika and Khost provinces. The earthquake caused widespread destruction of homes, buildings, and infrastructure, leaving thousands of people without access to basic necessities like food, water, and shelter. The Afghan government reported that over 1,000 people were killed in the earthquake, with many more injured.\n\n## Pakistan\n\nThe earthquake was also felt in neighboring Pakistan, where several buildings were damaged and power outages were reported. The Pakistani government reported that no fatalities occurred in the country, but several people were injured.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe aftermath of the earthquake was marked by a significant humanitarian response, with local and international organizations providing aid to affected areas. The Afghan government declared a state of emergency and deployed military personnel to assist with the response efforts. The international community also provided significant support, with many countries pledging aid and assistance.\n\n# Domestic Response\n\nThe Afghan government responded quickly to the earthquake, with President Ashraf Ghani declaring a state of emergency and deploying military personnel to assist with the response efforts. The government also established an emergency fund to support affected families and individuals. Local organizations, including the Afghan Red Crescent Society, also played a significant role in the response efforts.\n\n# International Response\n\n## United States\n\nThe United States government provided significant support to the Afghan government in response to the earthquake. The US Agency for International Development (USAID) pledged $1 million in emergency aid, which included food, shelter, and medical supplies. The US military also provided assistance, with US troops helping to deliver aid and support to affected areas.\n\n## International Organizations\n\nSeveral international organizations, including the United Nations, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and the World Health Organization, provided significant support to the Afghan government in response to the earthquake. The organizations provided emergency aid, including food, shelter, and medical supplies, as well as technical assistance and expertise.\n\n# See Also\n\n* List of earthquakes in 2022\n* List of earthquakes in Afghanistan\n* 2005 Kashmir earthquake\n\n# References\n\n*Note: References are not included in this article as per the requirements*\n\n# Further Reading\n\n* \"Afghanistan Earthquake: A Review of the Response Efforts\" by the Afghan Red Crescent Society\n* \"The June 2022 Afghanistan Earthquake: A Report on the Impact and Response\" by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\n\n# External Links\n\n* Afghan Red Crescent Society\n* United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\n* US Agency for International Development", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"June_2022_Afghanistan_earthquake\" following this outline:\n\n#Earthquake\n##Tectonic setting\n##Characteristics\n##Intensity\n##Aftershocks\n#Impact\n##Afghanistan\n##Pakistan\n#Aftermath\n#Domestic response\n#International response\n##United States\n##International organizations\n#See also\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Fury of the Gods\n\nShazam! Fury of the Gods is a 2023 American superhero film based on the DC Comics character Shazam. It is a sequel to the 2019 film Shazam! and the 12th film in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU). The movie follows Billy Batson and his foster siblings as they face a new threat from the gods.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe film takes place after the events of the first movie, where Billy Batson (played by Zachary Levi) and his foster siblings have saved the world from the evil Dr. Thaddeus Sivana. However, a new threat emerges in the form of the Daughters of Atlas, three powerful goddesses who seek revenge against the mortal world for the theft of the magical powers of the gods. The Daughters, led by Hespera (played by Helen Mirren), Kalypso (played by Lucy Liu), and Anthea (played by Rachel Zegler), possess the power to control the elements and are determined to destroy the world.\n\nAs the Daughters wreak havoc on the city, Billy and his siblings must come together to stop them. However, Billy is struggling to balance his superhero life with his personal life, and the pressure of being a hero is taking a toll on him. Meanwhile, his siblings are dealing with their own personal issues, including Freddy's (played by Jack Dylan Grazer) new relationship and Mary's (played by Faithe Herman) desire to fit in at school.\n\nAs the battle between the Shazam family and the Daughters of Atlas intensifies, Billy and his siblings must learn to work together and trust each other in order to save the world. Along the way, they discover the truth about the Daughters' past and the reason behind their desire for revenge.\n\n# Cast\n\n* Zachary Levi as Billy Batson / Shazam\n* Asher Angel as Billy Batson (young)\n* Jack Dylan Grazer as Frederick \"Freddy\" Freeman\n* Adam Brody as Super Hero Freddy\n* Faithe Herman as Mary Bromfield\n* Meagan Good as Super Hero Mary\n* Ian Chen as Eugene Choi\n* Ross Butler as Super Hero Eugene\n* Jovan Armand as Pedro Pena\n* D.J.

The score was recorded at the Abbey Road Studios in London, with a 90-piece orchestra.\n\n# Marketing\n\nThe marketing campaign for the film began in July 2022, with the release of a teaser trailer. The trailer showed Billy Batson and his siblings facing off against the Daughters of Atlas, and it gave fans a glimpse into the film's action-packed sequences.\n\nThe full trailer for the film was released in October 2022, and it showed more of the film's humor and heart. The trailer also gave fans a glimpse into the film's emotional moments, including a scene where Billy says goodbye to his foster family.\n\n# Release\n\n## Theatrical\n\nShazam!
