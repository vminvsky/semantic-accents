The coalition brings together several parties, including La France Insoumise, the Socialist Party, the French Communist Party, and Europe Ecology – The Greens, among others. NUPES was established with the goal of presenting a unified left-wing candidate in the 2022 French legislative election.\n\n# History\n\n## Formation\n\nThe New Ecological and Social People's Union was formed on May 1, 2022, following the 2022 French presidential election. The coalition was announced by Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the leader of La France Insoumise, and Olivier Faure, the leader of the Socialist Party. The two parties had previously collaborated in the 2019 European Parliament election, but the NUPES coalition marked a broader alliance between various left-wing parties.\n\n## Expansion\n\nIn the weeks following its formation, NUPES expanded to include several other parties, including the French Communist Party, Europe Ecology – The Greens, and the Radical Party of the Left. The coalition also attracted several smaller parties and movements, including the New Deal, the Pirate Party, and the Alternative Communist Party.\n\n## 2022 French legislative election\n\nNUPES presented a unified list of candidates in the 2022 French legislative election, which took place on June 12 and 19, 2022. The coalition's candidates campaigned on a platform of social and environmental reform, including the implementation of a €1,400 monthly minimum wage, the nationalization of key industries, and the adoption of a green new deal.\n\n## Electoral results and aftermath\n\nNUPES won 131 seats in the National Assembly, making it the second-largest group in the legislature. The coalition's strong showing was seen as a surprise by many observers, who had predicted a weaker performance by the left. In the aftermath of the election, NUPES announced its intention to form a left-wing opposition to the government of President Emmanuel Macron.\n\n## Election of René Pilato\n\nIn July 2022, René Pilato was elected as the leader of the NUPES group in the National Assembly. Pilato, a member of La France Insoumise, was chosen to lead the coalition's parliamentary group due to his experience as a deputy and his close relationships with other NUPES parties.\n\n## Quatennens Affair\n\nIn September 2022, NUPES was embroiled in controversy when Adrien Quatennens, a member of La France Insoumise and a NUPES deputy, was accused of domestic violence by his wife. Quatennens denied the allegations, but the incident sparked a wider debate about sexism and misogyny within the coalition.\n\n## Bayou Affair\n\nIn October 2022, NUPES was again embroiled in controversy when it emerged that several of its deputies had been involved in a scandal surrounding the use of parliamentary funds. The incident, which became known as the \"Bayou Affair,\" led to the resignation of several NUPES deputies and damaged the coalition's reputation.\n\n## Tensions with the Communist Party\n\nIn the months following the legislative election, tensions emerged between NUPES and the French Communist Party. The Communist Party, which had been a key partner in the coalition, began to distance itself from NUPES due to disagreements over policy and strategy.\n\n## Socialist infighting and election of Martine Froger\n\nIn November 2022, the Socialist Party, a key partner in NUPES, was embroiled in internal conflict. The party's leader, Olivier Faure, was challenged by Martine Froger, a deputy from the party's left wing. Froger ultimately emerged victorious, becoming the new leader of the Socialist Party.\n\n## Socialist Party suspension\n\nIn December 2022, the Socialist Party announced its suspension from NUPES. The party's decision was seen as a major blow to the coalition, which had relied heavily on the Socialist Party's support.\n\n# Members\n\nNUPES is composed of several parties, including:\n\n* La France Insoumise\n* Socialist Party\n* French Communist Party\n* Europe Ecology – The Greens\n* Radical Party of the Left\n* New Deal\n* Pirate Party\n* Alternative Communist Party\n\n## Former members\n\n* Socialist Party (suspended in December 2022)\n\n# Candidates 2022\n\nNUPES presented a unified list of candidates in the 2022 French legislative election. The coalition's candidates campaigned on a platform of social and environmental reform.\n\n## Breakdown by constituency\n\nNUPES presented candidates in 577 constituencies across France. The coalition's candidates were drawn from a range of parties and backgrounds.\n\n## Dissident candidates\n\nSeveral dissident candidates ran against NUPES candidates in the 2022 legislative election. These candidates, who were largely drawn from the Socialist Party and the French Communist Party, ran on rival platforms and won several seats.\n\n# Ideology and platform\n\nNUPES is a left-wing coalition that campaigns on a platform of social and environmental reform. The coalition's key policies include:\n\n* Implementing a €1,400 monthly minimum wage\n* Nationalizing key industries\n* Adopting a green new deal\n* Increasing public spending on health and education\n* Reducing inequality and poverty\n\n# Electoral history\n\nNUPES was formed in 2022 and presented a unified list of candidates in the 2022 French legislative election. The coalition won 131 seats in the National Assembly, making it the second-largest group in the legislature.\n\n## Legislative elections\n\n* 2022 French legislative election: 131 seats\n\n# Reactions\n\nNUPES has been the subject of both praise and criticism from across the French political spectrum.\n\n## PS majority and social-democratic left\n\nMany on the social-democratic left have welcomed NUPES as a necessary step towards rebuilding the left in France. The coalition's focus on social and environmental reform has been seen as a key part of this effort.\n\n## PS minority and opposition\n\nOthers on the left have been more critical of NUPES, seeing it as a threat to the Socialist Party's dominance. The coalition's decision to present a unified list of candidates has been seen as a challenge to the Socialist Party's authority.\n\n## Extra-parliamentary left\n\nThe extra-parliamentary left has been broadly supportive of NUPES, seeing it as a key part of the broader left-wing movement in France. The coalition's focus on social and environmental reform has been seen as a key part of this effort.\n\n## Presidential majority\n\nThe presidential majority, led by President Emmanuel Macron, has been critical of NUPES, seeing it as a threat to the government's authority. The coalition's decision to present a unified list of candidates has been seen as a challenge to the government's dominance.\n\n# See also\n\n* La France Insoumise\n* Socialist Party\n* French Communist Party\n* Europe Ecology – The Greens\n* Radical Party of the Left\n\n# Notes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"New_Ecological_and_Social_People's_Union\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Formation\n##Expansion\n##2022 French legislative election\n##Electoral results and aftermath\n##Election of René Pilato\n##Quatennens Affair\n##Bayou Affair\n##Tensions with the Communist Party\n##Socialist infighting and election of Martine Froger\n##Socialist Party suspension\n#Members\n##Former members\n#Candidates 2022\n##Breakdown by constituency\n##Dissident candidates\n#Ideology and platform\n#Electoral history\n##Legislative elections\n#Reactions\n##PS majority and social-democratic left\n##PS minority and opposition\n##Extra-parliamentary left\n##Presidential majority\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The disaster resulted in the loss of 159 lives and injured many others, making it one of the deadliest peacetime disasters in South Korean history.\n\n# Background\n\n## History of the district\n\nItaewon is a neighborhood in Yongsan-gu, Seoul, known for its vibrant nightlife, shopping, and dining scene. The area has a long history dating back to the 1960s, when it was a popular hangout spot for American soldiers stationed in Korea. Over the years, Itaewon has evolved into a cosmopolitan district, attracting tourists and locals alike with its unique blend of Korean and international culture.\n\n## Layout of the area\n\nThe Itaewon district is a narrow, winding area with steep hills and alleys. The main street, Itaewon-ro, is lined with bars, clubs, restaurants, and shops, making it a popular destination for young people and partygoers. However, the area's narrow streets and lack of open spaces can make it prone to congestion and overcrowding, particularly during peak hours or special events.\n\n# Conditions before the disaster\n\n## Lack of government preparation\n\nIn the days leading up to Halloween, concerns were raised about the potential for overcrowding and safety risks in Itaewon. However, the government and local authorities failed to take adequate measures to prepare for the expected large crowds. Despite warnings from experts and residents, no special crowd control measures were put in place, and the area was not designated as a \"special event zone,\" which would have required additional safety precautions.\n\n# Disaster\n\nOn the evening of October 29, 2022, a large crowd of people gathered in Itaewon to celebrate Halloween. As the night wore on, the streets became increasingly crowded, with people pushing and shoving to get through the narrow alleys. At around 10:20 pm, a surge of people moved down a steep alleyway, causing a massive crowd crush. The crush resulted in widespread panic, with people screaming and trying to escape the area. Emergency services were quickly overwhelmed, and it took several hours to evacuate the injured and deceased.\n\n# Immediate emergency response\n\nEmergency responders, including police, firefighters, and paramedics, were quickly dispatched to the scene. However, the narrow streets and congestion made it difficult for rescue teams to access the area, and many people were forced to wait for help. The emergency response was widely criticized for being slow and disorganized, with many witnesses reporting that it took several hours for medical help to arrive.\n\n# Victims\n\n## Identification of victims\n\nIn the days following the disaster, authorities worked to identify the victims and notify their families. Many of the deceased were young people, including students, workers, and tourists. The identification process was slow and difficult, with many families forced to wait for days or even weeks to learn the fate of their loved ones.\n\n## Mental health\n\nThe disaster had a significant impact on the mental health of survivors, witnesses, and family members of the victims. Many people reported experiencing trauma, anxiety, and depression in the aftermath of the disaster, and counseling services were made available to those in need.\n\n## Publication of the names of the fatalities\n\nAfter a period of mourning, the names of the fatalities were published by the authorities. The list included people from South Korea, China, Japan, the United States, and other countries, highlighting the international nature of the disaster.\n\n# Government response\n\n## Immediate response\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the disaster, the government expressed condolences to the families of the victims and promised a thorough investigation into the causes of the tragedy. However, the response was widely criticized for being slow and inadequate, with many people calling for greater accountability and action.\n\n## Investigation\n\nAn investigation into the disaster was launched, led by the police and the National Police Agency. The investigation focused on the causes of the crowd crush, including the role of government agencies, local authorities, and private businesses. The investigation also examined the emergency response and whether it was adequate.\n\n## Parliamentary inquiry\n\nA parliamentary inquiry was also launched to examine the government's response to the disaster and to identify lessons for the future. The inquiry heard testimony from witnesses, including survivors, emergency responders, and government officials.\n\n# Criticism and protests\n\n## Protests\n\nIn the days and weeks following the disaster, protests were held in Seoul and other cities across South Korea. The protests called for greater accountability and action from the government, as well as improved safety measures to prevent similar disasters in the future.\n\n## Criticisms of the investigation\n\nThe investigation into the disaster was widely criticized for being slow and inadequate. Many people called for greater transparency and accountability, and for the investigation to be more thorough and comprehensive.\n\n## Criticisms of the government\n\nThe government was also widely criticized for its response to the disaster, including its slow and inadequate emergency response, as well as its failure to take adequate measures to prevent the tragedy. Many people called for greater accountability and action from the government, including the resignation of officials responsible for the disaster.\n\n# Memorials\n\n## Mourning and memorial sites\n\nIn the aftermath of the disaster, memorial sites were established in Itaewon and other locations across South Korea. The sites included flowers, candles, and messages of condolence, and were visited by thousands of people.\n\n## Buddhist orders\n\nBuddhist orders also played a significant role in the mourning process, with many monks and nuns participating in memorial services and rituals.\n\n# International response\n\nThe international community expressed condolences and support to the people of South Korea in the aftermath of the disaster. Many countries, including the United States, China, and Japan, offered assistance and aid to the affected areas.\n\n# Impact on businesses\n\nThe disaster had a significant impact on businesses in Itaewon and other affected areas. Many businesses were forced to close temporarily or permanently, and the area's economy suffered as a result.\n\n# In the media\n\nThe disaster was widely reported in the media, both domestically and internationally. The media coverage focused on the causes of the tragedy, the emergency response, and the impact on the victims and their families.\n\n## Disaster-related ethics guidelines\n\nThe disaster also raised questions about disaster-related ethics guidelines, including the role of the media in reporting on disasters and the need for greater sensitivity and respect for the victims and their families.\n\n# Academic analysis\n\nThe disaster has also been the subject of academic analysis, with many scholars examining the causes and consequences of the tragedy. The analysis has focused on the role of government agencies, local authorities, and private businesses, as well as the emergency response and the impact on the victims and their families.\n\n# See also\n\n* Crowd control\n* Crowd crush\n* Disaster response\n* Emergency management\n* Itaewon\n* Seoul\n\n# Notes and references\n\n## Notes\n\n## References", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Seoul_Halloween_crowd_crush\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##History of the district\n##Layout of the area\n#Conditions before the disaster\n##Lack of government preparation\n#Disaster\n#Immediate emergency response\n#Victims\n##Identification of victims\n##Mental health\n##Publication of the names of the fatalities\n#Government response\n##Immediate response\n##Investigation\n##Parliamentary inquiry\n#Criticism and protests\n##Protests\n##Criticisms of the investigation\n##Criticisms of the government\n#Memorials\n##Mourning and memorial sites\n##Buddhist orders\n#International response\n#Impact on businesses\n#In the media\n##Disaster-related ethics guidelines\n#Academic analysis\n#See also\n#Notes and references\n##Notes\n##References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The suspensions targeted various accounts, including those belonging to journalists, flight-tracking services, and other users. The incident sparked widespread controversy and raised concerns about the platform's moderation policies and the role of its owner, Elon Musk.\n\n# Background\n\nTwitter has a long history of suspending accounts that violate its rules and policies. However, the December 2022 suspensions were notable for their scope and the types of accounts affected. In the months leading up to the suspensions, Musk had taken over as Twitter's owner and CEO, promising to promote free speech and reduce censorship on the platform. Despite these promises, the suspensions raised concerns that Musk was using his power to silence critics and stifle dissent.\n\n# Account Suspensions\n\nThe account suspensions began on December 15, 2022, and targeted a range of users. The suspensions were reportedly carried out by Twitter's automated systems, but Musk and other Twitter executives were also involved in the decision-making process.\n\n## Twitter Policy Changes\n\nIn the days leading up to the suspensions, Twitter announced several policy changes aimed at reducing the spread of misinformation and promoting user safety. The changes included new rules for linking to other social media platforms and restrictions on the sharing of personal information. However, many users and observers felt that the changes were overly broad and could be used to silence legitimate speech.\n\n## Suspension of Flight-Tracking Accounts\n\nOne of the first groups of accounts to be suspended were those belonging to flight-tracking services. These services used Twitter to share information about the location and movements of private jets and other aircraft. Musk and other Twitter executives claimed that the accounts were suspended because they were sharing sensitive information about the location of individuals, including Musk himself. However, many users felt that the suspensions were an overreaction and that the information being shared was already publicly available.\n\n## Suspension of Journalist Accounts\n\nOn December 15, 2022, Twitter suspended the accounts of several prominent journalists, including those from major news organizations such as CNN, The New York Times, and The Washington Post. The suspensions were reportedly carried out because the journalists had shared information about Musk's private jet and other sensitive topics. However, many users and observers felt that the suspensions were an attempt to silence critical voices and stifle investigative journalism.\n\n## Explanation from Twitter and Musk\n\nIn the aftermath of the suspensions, Twitter and Musk faced widespread criticism and backlash. Musk took to Twitter to explain the suspensions, claiming that the platform was committed to promoting user safety and reducing the spread of misinformation. However, many users felt that Musk's explanations were inadequate and that the suspensions were a clear overreach of the platform's moderation policies.\n\n# Reinstatement of Some Accounts\n\nIn the days following the suspensions, Twitter reinstated some of the affected accounts. The reinstatements were reportedly carried out after Twitter's moderation team reviewed the accounts and determined that they had not violated the platform's rules. However, many users felt that the reinstatements were too little, too late, and that the damage to the platform's reputation had already been done.\n\n# Responses\n\nThe December 2022 Twitter suspensions sparked widespread controversy and raised concerns about the platform's moderation policies and the role of its owner, Elon Musk.\n\n## Suspended Journalists\n\nThe journalists who were suspended by Twitter were vocal in their criticism of the platform and its owner. Many felt that the suspensions were an attempt to silence critical voices and stifle investigative journalism. In the aftermath of the suspensions, several of the affected journalists took to other social media platforms to share their experiences and criticize Twitter's moderation policies.\n\n## Other Commentators\n\nOther commentators and observers were also critical of Twitter's handling of the suspensions. Many felt that the suspensions were an overreach of the platform's moderation policies and that they raised concerns about the role of social media in promoting free speech and dissent. In the aftermath of the suspensions, several commentators called for greater transparency and accountability from Twitter and its owner, Elon Musk.\n\n# See also\n\n* Twitter\n* Elon Musk\n* Social media\n* Free speech\n* Online censorship", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"December_2022_Twitter_suspensions\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Account suspensions\n##Twitter policy changes\n##Suspension of flight-tracking accounts\n##Suspension of journalist accounts\n##Explanation from Twitter and Musk\n#Reinstatement of some accounts\n#Responses\n##Suspended journalists\n##Other commentators\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The process has its roots in the aftermath of World War II, when there was a strong desire to prevent future conflicts and promote peace, stability, and economic growth. Over the years, European integration has evolved through various stages, theories, and agreements, shaping the modern European landscape.\n\nHistory\n\nThe history of European integration can be traced back to the post-World War II era, when the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) was established in 1951. The ECSC was a supranational organization that brought together six European countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands) to manage their coal and steel resources. This marked the beginning of European integration, which would eventually lead to the creation of the European Union (EU).\n\nTheories of Integration\n\nTheories of integration have played a crucial role in shaping the European integration process. These theories can be broadly categorized into three phases: proto-integration, explaining integration, and analyzing governance.\n\n### Proto-Integration Period\n\nDuring the proto-integration period, which spanned from the 1950s to the 1960s, the focus was on creating a unified Europe through economic integration. The ECSC was the first major step towards this goal, followed by the establishment of the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1957. The EEC aimed to create a common market among its member states, promoting free trade and economic cooperation.\n\n### First Phase: Explaining Integration, 1960s Onwards\n\nThe first phase of integration theories, which began in the 1960s, focused on explaining the integration process. This phase saw the emergence of neo-functionalism, which emphasized the role of supranational institutions in promoting integration. Neo-functionalists argued that integration would lead to a gradual transfer of powers from national governments to supranational institutions, creating a more unified Europe.\n\n### Second Phase: Analyzing Governance, 1980s Onwards\n\nThe second phase of integration theories, which began in the 1980s, focused on analyzing governance in the European Community. This phase saw the emergence of intergovernmentalism, which emphasized the role of national governments in shaping European integration. Intergovernmentalists argued that integration was driven by the interests of national governments, rather than supranational institutions.\n\n### Third Phase: Constructing the EU, 1990s Onwards\n\nThe third phase of integration theories, which began in the 1990s, focused on constructing the EU. This phase saw the emergence of constructivism, which emphasized the role of ideas and norms in shaping European integration. Constructivists argued that integration was driven by a shared sense of European identity and a commitment to common values.\n\nCitizens' Organisations Calling for Further Integration\n\nSeveral citizens' organizations have been established to promote further European integration. These organizations include the European Movement International, the European Youth Forum, and the European Citizen Action Service. These organizations aim to promote a more unified and democratic Europe, through advocacy, education, and mobilization.\n\nOverlap of Membership in Various Agreements\n\nMany European countries are members of multiple international agreements, which can create overlapping memberships and obligations.\n\n### Common Membership of Member States of the European Union\n\nAll EU member states are also members of the Council of Europe, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). Many EU member states are also members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the United Nations (UN).\n\n### Most Integrated Countries\n\nSome European countries are more integrated than others, due to their membership in various agreements and organizations. The most integrated countries in Europe are typically those that are members of the EU, the eurozone, and the Schengen Area. These countries include Germany, France, Italy, and the Netherlands.\n\nGeographic Scope\n\nEuropean integration has a geographic scope that extends beyond the European continent.\n\n### Beyond Geographic Europe\n\nThe EU has a number of overseas territories and dependencies, which are located outside of the European continent. These territories include French Guiana, Martinique, and Réunion, which are located in the Caribbean and South America.\n\n### Limited to Regions within Geographic Europe\n\nEuropean integration is also limited to specific regions within the European continent. These regions include the Nordic countries, the Baltic Sea region, and the Mediterranean region.\n\n#### Nordic Countries\n\nThe Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden) have a high level of economic and social integration, through their membership in the Nordic Council and the Nordic Cooperation.\n\n#### Baltic Sea Region\n\nThe Baltic Sea region (Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Russia, and Sweden) has a high level of economic and environmental integration, through their membership in the Council of the Baltic Sea States.\n\n#### Nordic-Baltic Eight\n\nThe Nordic-Baltic Eight (Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, and Sweden) have a high level of economic and social integration, through their membership in the Nordic-Baltic Eight cooperation.\n\n#### Low Countries Region (Benelux)\n\nThe Low Countries region (Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands) has a high level of economic and social integration, through their membership in the Benelux Union.\n\n#### Black Sea Region\n\nThe Black Sea region (Bulgaria, Georgia, Romania, Russia, Turkey, and Ukraine) has a high level of economic and environmental integration, through their membership in the Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation.\n\n#### United Kingdom and Ireland\n\nThe United Kingdom and Ireland have a high level of economic and social integration, through their membership in the British-Irish Council.\n\n#### Central Europe\n\nCentral Europe (Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia) has a high level of economic and social integration, through their membership in the Visegrád Group.\n\n#### Eastern Europe\n\nEastern Europe (Belarus, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Russia, and Ukraine) has a high level of economic and social integration, through their membership in the Commonwealth of Independent States.\n\n#### Danube Region\n\nThe Danube region (Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Moldova, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, and Ukraine) has a high level of economic and environmental integration, through their membership in the Danube Region Strategy.\n\n#### Balkans\n\nThe Balkans (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro, Romania, and Serbia) have a high level of economic and social integration, through their membership in the Balkan Cooperation Process.\n\nCouncil of Europe\n\nThe Council of Europe is an international organization that promotes democracy, human rights, and the rule of law in Europe.

Commissioned in 1998, the ship played a significant role in various naval operations, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This article provides an overview of the ship's history, its operational career, and its eventual sinking.\n\n#History\n\n##As Slava\n\nThe Slava-class cruiser was designed in the 1970s by the Soviet Union's Severnoye Design Bureau. The ship was laid down at the 61 Kommunar Shipbuilding Plant in Mykolaiv, Ukraine, on November 27, 1976, and launched on July 27, 1979. Initially named Slava, the ship was commissioned into the Soviet Navy on January 30, 1983. As a Slava-class cruiser, the ship was designed to provide air defense and anti-surface warfare capabilities, equipped with a range of missiles, guns, and electronic warfare systems.\n\n##As Moskva\n\nFollowing the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the ship was transferred to the Russian Navy and renamed Moskva in 1995. The Moskva underwent a series of modernization and refit programs, including the installation of new radar and electronic warfare systems. The ship's armament was also upgraded with the addition of new missile systems, including the P-1000 Vulkan anti-ship missile. The Moskva played a significant role in Russian naval operations, participating in exercises and deployments in the Mediterranean and Black Seas.\n\n##Russian invasion of Ukraine\n\nIn 2014, the Russian Federation annexed Crimea, sparking a conflict with Ukraine. The Moskva played a key role in the Russian naval operations during the conflict. The ship was deployed to the Black Sea, where it provided air defense and anti-surface warfare capabilities in support of Russian ground forces.\n\n###Snake Island campaign\n\nIn 2022, the Moskva was involved in the Snake Island campaign, a series of operations aimed at capturing the strategic island in the Black Sea. The ship provided gunfire support to Russian ground forces, helping to secure the island. However, the campaign was widely criticized by the international community, with many viewing it as an act of aggression against Ukraine.\n\n###Sinking\n\nOn April 14, 2022, the Moskva was struck by two Ukrainian Neptune anti-ship missiles while operating in the Black Sea. The ship suffered significant damage and caught fire, leading to a loss of power and control. Despite efforts to save the ship, the Moskva sank in the early hours of April 15, 2022, resulting in the loss of at least one life. The sinking of the Moskva was widely reported in the media, with many viewing it as a significant blow to the Russian Navy's prestige and capabilities.\n\n#Notes\n\n* The Moskva was one of three Slava-class cruisers built by the Soviet Union, with the other two ships being the Marshal Ustinov and the Varyag.\n* The ship's armament included 16 P-1000 Vulkan anti-ship missiles, 64 S-300F air defense missiles, and 2 AK-130 twin-barreled 130mm guns.\n* The Moskva was powered by a combination of gas turbines and diesel engines, giving the ship a top speed of 32 knots (59 km/h).\n\n#References\n\nTo be added\n\n#External links\n\nTo be added", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Russian_cruiser_Moskva\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##As Slava\n##As Moskva\n##Russian invasion of Ukraine\n###Snake Island campaign\n###Sinking\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The conflict is a result of a power struggle between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a paramilitary group that was previously aligned with the SAF. The conflict has also involved other armed groups, including the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N) and the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM).\n\n# Background\n\n## War in Darfur and the formation of the RSF\n\nThe conflict in Darfur, a region in western Sudan, began in 2003 when the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM) and the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) rebelled against the government. The conflict resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people and the displacement of millions. In 2003, the Sudanese government formed the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a paramilitary group that was composed of former Janjaweed militiamen. The RSF was formed to counter the SLM and JEM, but it also committed numerous human rights abuses against civilians in Darfur.\n\n## Political transition\n\nIn 2019, a popular uprising in Sudan led to the overthrow of President Omar al-Bashir, who had ruled the country since 1989. The uprising was led by a coalition of opposition groups, including the Forces of Freedom and Change (FFC). After al-Bashir's overthrow, a transitional government was formed, led by Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok. The transitional government was tasked with leading the country to democratic elections.\n\n## Origins of the SPLM-N and the SLM\n\nThe Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N) was formed in 2011, after South Sudan gained independence from Sudan. The SPLM-N is a rebel group that operates in the states of Blue Nile and South Kordofan. The group is led by Abdelaziz al-Hilu and fights for greater autonomy for the people of Blue Nile and South Kordofan.\n\nThe Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM) was formed in 2001, with the goal of ending the marginalization of the people of Darfur. The group is led by Abdelwahid al-Nur and fights for greater autonomy for the people of Darfur.\n\n## Prelude\n\nIn the months leading up to the conflict, tensions between the SAF and the RSF increased. The RSF, led by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (also known as Hemedti), had been seeking greater autonomy and power within the government. The SAF, led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, was opposed to the RSF's demands and saw them as a threat to the government's authority.\n\n# Course of the War\n\n## April–May 2023\n\n### Battle of Khartoum\n\nThe conflict began on April 15, 2023, when the RSF launched a surprise attack on the SAF in Khartoum, the capital city of Sudan. The attack was sparked by a dispute over the RSF's role in the government and the SAF's refusal to recognize the RSF's autonomy. The battle lasted for several days and resulted in the deaths of hundreds of people.\n\n### Treaty of Jeddah\n\nOn April 25, 2023, the SAF and the RSF signed the Treaty of Jeddah, a ceasefire agreement brokered by Saudi Arabia. The treaty established a ceasefire and called for the withdrawal of RSF forces from Khartoum. However, the treaty did not address the underlying issues that led to the conflict and was ultimately unsuccessful in ending the fighting.\n\n## June–September 2023\n\n### Continued fighting in Khartoum\n\nDespite the Treaty of Jeddah, fighting continued in Khartoum throughout June and July 2023. The RSF launched several attacks on the SAF, but was ultimately unable to gain control of the city.\n\n### Diplomatic efforts\n\nIn June 2023, the African Union and the Arab League launched a joint diplomatic effort to end the conflict. The effort was led by a team of mediators who met with leaders from the SAF and the RSF. However, the effort was ultimately unsuccessful in ending the fighting.\n\n### SPLM-N (Al-Hilu) involvement\n\nIn July 2023, the SPLM-N, led by Abdelaziz al-Hilu, joined the conflict on the side of the RSF. The SPLM-N launched several attacks on the SAF in Blue Nile and South Kordofan.\n\n### Darfur front\n\nIn August 2023, the SLM, led by Abdelwahid al-Nur, joined the conflict on the side of the RSF. The SLM launched several attacks on the SAF in Darfur.\n\n## October–December 2023\n\n### SAF collapse in Darfur\n\nIn October 2023, the SAF launched a major counterattack against the RSF and the SLM in Darfur. However, the attack was ultimately unsuccessful and the SAF was forced to retreat.\n\n### Peace negotiations stall\n\nIn November 2023, peace negotiations between the SAF and the RSF stalled. The RSF refused to agree to a ceasefire, citing concerns about the SAF's willingness to implement the terms of the Treaty of Jeddah.\n\n### RSF Crossing of the Nile\n\nIn December 2023, the RSF launched a major attack on the SAF in Khartoum, crossing the Nile River and capturing several key military installations.\n\n## January–April 2024\n\n### Hemedti travels abroad\n\nIn January 2024, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (Hemedti) traveled to several countries in the Middle East and Africa, seeking support for the RSF.\n\n### Fighting in Kordofan and Gezira\n\nIn February 2024, fighting broke out in Kordofan and Gezira, two states in central Sudan. The fighting was sparked by a dispute between the SAF and the RSF over control of the regions.\n\n### SAF gains in Omdurman\n\nIn March 2024, the SAF launched a major counterattack against the RSF in Omdurman, a city in Khartoum state. The attack was ultimately successful, and the SAF was able to capture several key military installations.\n\n## April 2024–present\n\n### Fighting in Darfur\n\nFighting continues in Darfur, with the SLM and the RSF clashing with the SAF.\n\n### Fighting in Kordofan\n\nFighting continues in Kordofan, with the SPLM-N and the RSF clashing with the SAF.\n\n##", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Sudanese_civil_war_(2023–present)\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##War in Darfur and the formation of the RSF\n##Political transition\n##Origins of the SPLM-N and the SLM\n##Prelude\n#Course of the war\n##April–May 2023\n###Battle of Khartoum\n###Treaty of Jeddah\n##June–September 2023\n###Continued fighting in Khartoum\n###Diplomatic efforts\n###SPLM-N (Al-Hilu) involvement\n###Darfur front\n##October–December 2023\n###SAF collapse in Darfur\n###Peace negotiations stall\n###RSF Crossing of the Nile\n##January–April 2024\n###Hemedti travels abroad\n###Fighting in Kordofan and Gezira\n###SAF gains in Omdurman\n##April 2024–present\n###Fighting in Darfur\n###Fighting in Kordofan\n###Fighting along the Nile\n###SAF offensives\n#Casualties\n##Darfur\n##Sexual violence\n##Casualties among humanitarian workers\n##Attacks on journalists\n##Foreign casualties\n##Notable deaths\n#Foreign involvement\n##Egypt\n###Egyptian POWs\n##United Arab Emirates\n##Russia\n###Wagner Group\n##Iran\n##Other foreign actors\n###Chad\n###Kenya\n###Libyan National Army\n###Ukraine\n###United Kingdom\n##Evacuation of foreign nationals\n##Sanctions\n###United States\n###Other countries\n#Humanitarian impact\n##Refugees\n#Economic impact\n#War crimes investigations\n#Disinformation\n##Examples\n##Responses\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

I. Suchianu\n\nDimitrie Ion Suchianu, commonly known as D. I. Suchianu, was a Romanian writer, critic, and cultural activist. A prolific writer, Suchianu's literary career spanned over six decades, during which he contributed to various literary and cultural movements in Romania.\n\n#Biography\n\n##Early life and debut\n\nBorn in 1896 in the town of Piatra Neamț, Romania, Suchianu came from a family of modest means. His early life was marked by a love for literature and a strong desire to write. After completing his primary education, Suchianu attended the local high school, where he began to develop his writing skills. His first literary attempts were published in local newspapers and magazines, mostly consisting of poetry and short stories.\n\nIn 1914, Suchianu moved to Bucharest, the capital city of Romania, to pursue higher education. He enrolled in the faculty of literature at the University of Bucharest, where he studied under the guidance of prominent literary figures of the time. During his university years, Suchianu became involved in the city's vibrant literary circle, befriending writers such as Tudor Arghezi and Gala Galaction.\n\n##Interwar culture critic\n\nFollowing World War I, Suchianu established himself as a prominent literary critic and cultural commentator. He began writing for various literary magazines and newspapers, including the influential literary review, \"Sburătorul\". Suchianu's critical essays and reviews focused on the works of emerging Romanian writers, as well as on the broader cultural and social issues of the time.\n\nDuring the interwar period, Suchianu was a vocal advocate for the development of a modern, cosmopolitan Romanian culture. He believed that Romanian culture should be open to Western influences and that the country's writers and artists should engage with the broader European cultural scene. Suchianu's advocacy for cultural modernity and his promotion of young, avant-garde writers earned him both praise and criticism from his contemporaries.\n\n##Under fascism\n\nThe rise of fascist and nationalist movements in Romania in the 1930s had a profound impact on Suchianu's life and work. As a vocal critic of fascism and a proponent of liberal, democratic values, Suchianu found himself increasingly at odds with the new political order. In 1938, he was forced to resign from his position as editor of the literary review, \"Sburătorul\", due to pressure from the fascist authorities.\n\nDespite the restrictions and censorship imposed by the fascist regime, Suchianu continued to write and publish his work. However, his writing became increasingly cautious and circumspect, as he sought to avoid persecution and reprisal. During this period, Suchianu's work focused more on literary theory and criticism, rather than on overtly political or social commentary.\n\n##1944 coup and communization\n\nThe August 1944 coup, which overthrew the fascist regime and brought Romania into the Soviet sphere of influence, marked a significant turning point in Suchianu's life and career. In the aftermath of the coup, Suchianu was appointed as the director of the Romanian Writers' Union, a position he held until 1947.\n\nAs the Communist Party consolidated its power in Romania, Suchianu found himself under increasing pressure to conform to the new ideological orthodoxy. Despite his earlier criticisms of communism, Suchianu attempted to adapt to the new circumstances, publishing works that reflected the Party's ideological line. However, his efforts to conform were ultimately unsuccessful, and he was eventually marginalized by the communist authorities.\n\n##Old age and death\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, Suchianu's health began to decline, and he became increasingly reclusive. Despite his physical infirmity, Suchianu continued to write, producing a number of literary works that were published posthumously.\n\nD. I. Suchianu died in 1985, at the age of 89, in Bucharest, Romania. Despite his complex and often tumultuous life, Suchianu left behind a significant literary legacy, one that continues to be celebrated and studied in Romania today.\n\n#Legacy\n\nSuchianu's literary legacy is complex and multifaceted, reflecting the various stages of his career and the shifting cultural and political contexts in which he wrote. As a literary critic and cultural commentator, Suchianu played an important role in shaping the development of modern Romanian literature.\n\nSuchianu's advocacy for cultural modernity and his promotion of young, avant-garde writers helped to establish Romania as a major cultural force in Eastern Europe. His own literary work, which spanned multiple genres and styles, continues to be studied and admired for its technical skill and intellectual depth.\n\nDespite the challenges and controversies that marked his life, Suchianu remains one of the most important and influential Romanian writers of the 20th century. His legacy serves as a testament to the power of literature to transcend time and circumstance, and to the enduring importance of cultural and intellectual freedom.\n\n#Notes\n\n#References", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"D._I._Suchianu\" following this outline:\n\n#Biography\n##Early life and debut\n##Interwar culture critic\n##Under fascism\n##1944 coup and communization\n##Old age and death\n#Legacy\n#Notes\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The incident involved two vintage military aircraft, a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress and a Bell P-63 Kingcobra, which collided in mid-air and crashed, resulting in the loss of six lives.\n\n## Aircraft\n\nThe Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, registration number N7227C, was a World War II-era bomber aircraft built in 1943. It was one of the last remaining airworthy B-17s in the world and was operated by the Commemorative Air Force (CAF), a non-profit organization dedicated to preserving and flying vintage military aircraft. The B-17 was one of the main attractions at the air show, performing a series of flybys and demonstrations.\n\nThe Bell P-63 Kingcobra, registration number N67654, was a World War II-era fighter aircraft built in 1945. It was also operated by the CAF and was one of the fastest and most maneuverable aircraft of its time. The P-63 was performing a series of aerobatic maneuvers when the collision occurred.\n\n## Crash\n\nThe collision occurred at approximately 1:20 pm local time, during a routine flyby of the B-17 and P-63. Witnesses reported that the P-63 was flying in a steep climb when it collided with the B-17, which was flying in a level attitude. The impact caused significant damage to both aircraft, and they crashed to the ground in a nearby field.\n\nThe B-17 broke apart on impact, with the wings and tail section separating from the fuselage. The P-63 crashed nearby, with the engine and cockpit area suffering significant damage. Both aircraft caught fire, with flames engulfing the wreckage.\n\n## Victims\n\nSix people were killed in the accident, including the pilots and crew members of both aircraft. The victims were identified as:\n\n* Terry Barker, pilot of the B-17\n* Leonard \"Len\" Root, co-pilot of the B-17\n* Dan Ragan, flight engineer of the B-17\n* Curtis Rowe, gunner of the B-17\n* Craig Hutain, pilot of the P-63\n* Kevin Michels, passenger on the P-63\n\n## Investigation\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) launched an investigation into the accident, with assistance from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the CAF. The investigation focused on the circumstances leading up to the collision, including the actions of the pilots and air traffic control.\n\nPreliminary findings indicated that the P-63 was flying in a restricted area when the collision occurred, and that the pilots of both aircraft may have failed to maintain adequate separation. The investigation also examined the maintenance and inspection records of both aircraft, as well as the training and experience of the pilots.\n\n## Public Response\n\nThe accident was met with shock and sadness from the aviation community and the general public. The CAF issued a statement expressing its condolences to the families of the victims and promising to cooperate fully with the investigation.\n\nThe air show was canceled for the remainder of the weekend, and a memorial service was held to honor the victims. The incident also raised concerns about the safety of vintage military aircraft and the need for stricter regulations and safety protocols.\n\n## References\n\n*Note: References are not included in this article as per the requirements*\n\n## External Links\n\n* National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation page\n* Commemorative Air Force (CAF) statement on the accident\n* Wings Over Dallas air show website", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Dallas_air_show_mid-air_collision\" following this outline:\n\n#Aircraft\n#Crash\n#Victims\n#Investigation\n#Public response\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Chase, a prominent figure in American politics and law, served as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court from 1796 until his acquittal in 1805. The impeachment proceedings against him were sparked by his perceived partisan bias and his conduct during several high-profile trials.\n\n#Background\n\nSamuel Chase was a prominent figure in American politics and law, serving as a delegate to the Continental Congress, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, and a Justice of the Supreme Court. He was known for his strong Federalist views and his ardent support of the Alien and Sedition Acts, which were highly unpopular among many Americans. Chase's conduct during several high-profile trials, including the trials of John Fries and James Callender, had drawn criticism from many who saw him as biased and overly partisan.\n\n#Impeachment in the House of Representatives\n\n##Vote to launch impeachment inquiry\n\nOn March 12, 1804, the House of Representatives voted 73-32 to launch an impeachment inquiry into Chase's conduct. The vote was largely along party lines, with Republicans supporting the inquiry and Federalists opposing it.\n\n##Early inquiry developments\n\nThe House Committee on the Judiciary, led by Chairman John Randolph, began gathering evidence and testimony against Chase. The committee heard from several witnesses, including lawyers and judges who had worked with Chase, and reviewed transcripts of his conduct during the trials in question.\n\n##Adoption of impeachment resolution\n\nOn October 25, 1804, the House Committee on the Judiciary adopted a resolution impeaching Chase on several counts, including \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" and \"arbitrary, oppressive, and unjust\" behavior.\n\n##Subsequent months of inquiry\n\nOver the next several months, the House Committee on the Judiciary continued to gather evidence and testimony against Chase. The committee heard from additional witnesses and reviewed further documentation, including Chase's own letters and correspondence.\n\n##Adoption of articles of impeachment\n\nOn December 4, 1804, the House of Representatives adopted eight articles of impeachment against Chase.\n\n###Article I\n\nThe first article of impeachment charged Chase with \"arbitrary, oppressive, and unjust\" behavior during the trial of John Fries, a Pennsylvania farmer who had been accused of treason.\n\n###Article II\n\nThe second article charged Chase with \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" during the trial of James Callender, a Republican journalist who had been accused of sedition.\n\n###Article III\n\nThe third article charged Chase with \"arbitrary, oppressive, and unjust\" behavior during the trial of John Humphrey, a Republican lawyer who had been accused of contempt of court.\n\n###Article IV\n\nThe fourth article charged Chase with \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" during the trial of Anthony Haswell, a Republican printer who had been accused of sedition.\n\n###Article V\n\nThe fifth article charged Chase with \"arbitrary, oppressive, and unjust\" behavior during the trial of James Thompson Callender, the son of James Callender, who had been accused of contempt of court.\n\n###Article VI\n\nThe sixth article charged Chase with \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" during the trial of Thomas Cooper, a Republican lawyer who had been accused of sedition.\n\n###Article VII\n\nThe seventh article charged Chase with \"arbitrary, oppressive, and unjust\" behavior during the trial of William Duane, a Republican printer who had been accused of sedition.\n\n###Article VIII\n\nThe eighth article charged Chase with \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" during the trial of William Cobbett, a Republican journalist who had been accused of sedition.\n\n###Vote overview\n\nThe vote on the articles of impeachment was largely along party lines, with Republicans supporting the impeachment and Federalists opposing it.\n\n#Appointment of House managers\n\nOn December 5, 1804, the House of Representatives appointed a team of managers to prosecute the case against Chase in the Senate. The team was led by John Randolph, who had chaired the House Committee on the Judiciary during the impeachment inquiry.\n\n#Senate trial\n\n##Officers of the trial\n\nThe Senate trial was presided over by Vice President George Clinton, who served as the President pro tempore of the Senate. The trial was also attended by several officers, including the Secretary of the Senate and the Sergeant at Arms.\n\n##Rules of the trial\n\nThe Senate established several rules for the trial, including the requirement that all witnesses be sworn in and that all testimony be taken in writing.\n\n##Start of the proceedings\n\nThe trial began on February 4, 1805, with the presentation of the articles of impeachment by the House managers.\n\n##Decoration and arrangement of the Senate Chamber\n\nThe Senate Chamber was specially decorated for the trial, with a raised platform for the judges and a special alcove for the defendant.\n\n##Pleading phase\n\nDuring the pleading phase, Chase's lawyers entered a plea of not guilty on his behalf.\n\n##Argument phase\n\n###Prosecution's presentation\n\nThe prosecution presented its case first, with the House managers calling several witnesses to testify against Chase. The prosecution argued that Chase's conduct had been arbitrary, oppressive, and unjust, and that he had brought the judiciary into disrepute.\n\n###Defense's presentation\n\nThe defense presented its case next, with Chase's lawyers calling several witnesses to testify on his behalf. The defense argued that Chase had acted within his authority and that his conduct had been fair and impartial.\n\n###Closing remarks\n\nThe prosecution and defense each presented closing remarks, with the prosecution arguing that Chase's conduct had been a betrayal of the public trust and the defense arguing that the impeachment was a partisan attack on the judiciary.\n\n##Verdict\n\nOn March 1, 1805, the Senate voted on the articles of impeachment, with a two-thirds majority required for conviction. Chase was acquitted on all eight articles, with the closest vote being 19-15 on Article III.\n\n#Aftermath\n\n##Immediate aftermath\n\nThe acquittal of Chase was seen as a major victory for the Federalist Party and a defeat for the Republican Party. The impeachment had been widely seen as a partisan attack on the judiciary, and the acquittal was seen as a vindication of Chase's conduct.\n\n##Legacy\n\nThe impeachment of Samuel Chase is widely regarded as a landmark event in the history of the United States, marking the first time a Supreme Court Justice had been impeached by the House of Representatives. The impeachment proceedings against Chase established several important precedents for future impeachment proceedings, including the requirement that the House of Representatives adopt articles of impeachment by a majority vote and the requirement that the Senate try the case by a two-thirds majority vote.\n\n#References\n##Sources cited", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Impeachment_of_Samuel_Chase\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Impeachment in the House of Representatives\n##Vote to launch impeachment inquiry\n##Early inquiry developments\n##Adoption of impeachment resolution\n##Subsequent months of inquiry\n##Adoption of articles of impeachment\n###Article I\n###Article II\n###Article III\n###Article IV\n###Article V\n###Article VI\n###Article VII\n###Article VIII\n###Vote overview\n#Appointment of House managers\n#Senate trial\n##Officers of the trial\n##Rules of the trial\n##Start of the proceedings\n##Decoration and arrangement of the Senate Chamber\n##Pleading phase\n##Argument phase\n###Prosecution's presentation\n###Defense's presentation\n###Closing remarks\n##Verdict\n#Aftermath\n##Immediate aftermath\n##Legacy\n#References\n##Sources cited\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

After his parents divorced, West moved to Chicago, Illinois, with his mother, where he spent most of his childhood. West's mother, a former English professor, played a significant role in his early life, encouraging his interest in the arts and exposing him to music, literature, and art.\n\nMusical Career\n----------------\n\n### 1996–2002: Early work and Roc-A-Fella\n\nWest's interest in music began at an early age, and he started rapping in the third grade. He attended Chicago State University but dropped out to pursue a career in music. In the late 1990s, West produced music for local artists, eventually landing a job as a producer for Roc-A-Fella Records, co-founded by Jay-Z and Damon Dash. West's early work with Roc-A-Fella included producing tracks for artists such as Janet Jackson and Alicia Keys.\n\n### 2003–2006: The College Dropout and Late Registration\n\nIn 2003, West released his debut album, \"The College Dropout,\" which received widespread critical acclaim and commercial success.

West's second album, \"Late Registration,\" released in 2005, was an even greater success, featuring the hit singles \"Gold Digger\" and \"Touch the Sky.\"\n\n### 2007–2009: Graduation, 808s & Heartbreak, and VMAs incident\n\nIn 2007, West released his third album, \"Graduation,\" which debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart and featured the hit singles \"Stronger\" and \"Good Life.\" The album's success was overshadowed by West's infamous feud with Taylor Swift at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, where he stormed the stage and interrupted Swift's acceptance speech.

The album received mixed reviews and was followed by the Saint Pablo Tour, which was cancelled due to West's mental health issues and hospitalization.\n\n### 2017–2019: Ye and the Wyoming Sessions\n\nIn 2018, West released his eighth album, \"Ye,\" which was recorded in Wyoming and featured a more introspective and personal sound. The album was released alongside a series of collaborative albums, known as the Wyoming Sessions, which featured contributions from various artists, including Pusha T and Nas.\n\n### 2019–2022: Jesus Is King, Donda, and Donda 2\n\nIn 2019, West released his ninth album, \"Jesus Is King,\" which marked a significant departure from his previous work, featuring a more gospel-inspired sound. The album was followed by his tenth album, \"Donda,\" released in 2021, which featured a more experimental and eclectic sound.

{"title": "Mount_Rushmore_in_popular_culture", "content": "#Reasons for popularity\n#Common themes\n##Destruction\n##Alterations and additions to the faces\n#Imitations of the style\n#Major portrayals\n##In North by Northwest\n#In music\n#See also\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Mount Rushmore in Popular Culture\n\nMount Rushmore, a large sculpture carved into the side of a mountain in the Black Hills of South Dakota, has been a source of fascination for artists, writers, and filmmakers since its completion in 1941. The monument, which features the faces of four U.S. presidents - George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln - has been depicted in countless works of popular culture, from films and television shows to music and literature.\n\n#Reasons for popularity\n\nThere are several reasons why Mount Rushmore has become a staple of popular culture. One reason is its iconic status as a symbol of American history and democracy. The monument's sheer size and grandeur make it a powerful and enduring image that has been etched into the American consciousness. Another reason is its unique blend of natural and man-made elements, which has inspired artists and writers to explore themes of nature, identity, and the human condition. Finally, Mount Rushmore's remote location in the Black Hills of South Dakota has made it a source of fascination for those interested in the American West and the mythology of the frontier.\n\n#Common themes\n\nMount Rushmore has been depicted in popular culture in a variety of ways, but certain themes and motifs have emerged as particularly common. Two of the most popular themes are destruction and alteration, which reflect broader cultural anxieties about the fragility of monuments and the impermanence of human achievement.\n\n##Destruction\n\nOne of the most enduring images of Mount Rushmore in popular culture is its destruction. This theme has been explored in countless films, television shows, and works of literature, from the classic sci-fi film \"Superman II\" to the more recent \"Team America: World Police.\" In these depictions, Mount Rushmore is often shown being destroyed by natural disasters, alien invasions, or other catastrophic events. This theme reflects a broader cultural anxiety about the fragility of monuments and the impermanence of human achievement. By depicting Mount Rushmore as vulnerable to destruction, artists and writers are able to explore themes of mortality, decay, and the fleeting nature of human accomplishment.\n\n##Alterations and additions to the faces\n\nAnother common theme in depictions of Mount Rushmore is the alteration or addition of faces to the monument. This theme has been explored in a variety of films, television shows, and works of literature, from the classic comedy film \"North by Northwest\" to the more recent \"The Simpsons.\" In these depictions, the faces of the presidents are often altered or added to in order to make a commentary on contemporary politics or culture. For example, in \"The Simpsons,\" the face of Homer Simpson is added to the monument, reflecting the show's irreverent and satirical take on American culture. This theme reflects a broader cultural interest in reinterpreting and recontextualizing historical monuments in order to make them relevant to contemporary issues and concerns.\n\n#Imitations of the style\n\nMount Rushmore's unique style, which combines natural and man-made elements, has been imitated in countless works of popular culture. From the iconic \" presidents' heads\" in the film \" Planet 51\" to the more recent \" Mount Rushmore\"-style sculptures in the film \"The Grand Budapest Hotel\", the monument's style has been parodied and homaged in a wide range of films, television shows, and works of literature. This imitation reflects a broader cultural fascination with the monument's unique blend of natural and man-made elements, as well as its status as a symbol of American history and democracy.\n\n#Major portrayals\n\nMount Rushmore has been portrayed in countless films, television shows, and works of literature, but some depictions stand out as particularly notable. One of the most iconic depictions of the monument is in the classic film \"North by Northwest\".\n\n##In North by Northwest\n\nIn the 1959 film \"North by Northwest\", Mount Rushmore is depicted as a symbol of American democracy and freedom. The film's protagonist, Roger Thornhill, played by Cary Grant, visits the monument in order to uncover a plot by spies to steal government secrets. The film's depiction of Mount Rushmore is notable for its use of the monument as a symbol of American values and ideals. The film's director, Alfred Hitchcock, was known for his use of iconic landmarks and monuments as symbols of broader cultural themes, and his depiction of Mount Rushmore in \"North by Northwest\" is no exception.\n\n#In music\n\nMount Rushmore has also been referenced in music, from the classic rock song \"Mount Rushmore\" by the band \"The Guess Who\" to the more recent \"Mount Rushmore\"-inspired lyrics in the song \"American Kids\" by Kenny Chesney. These references reflect a broader cultural fascination with the monument as a symbol of American history and democracy.\n\n#See also\n\n* Mount Rushmore\n* National Park Service\n* Black Hills\n* South Dakota\n* American culture\n* Popular culture\n* Iconic landmarks\n* Monuments and memorials", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Mount_Rushmore_in_popular_culture\" following this outline:\n\n#Reasons for popularity\n#Common themes\n##Destruction\n##Alterations and additions to the faces\n#Imitations of the style\n#Major portrayals\n##In North by Northwest\n#In music\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Situated along the Ottawa River, the village has a rich and diverse history spanning over two centuries. From its early days as a mill town to its current status as a desirable residential area, Britannia Village has undergone significant transformations, shaped by its unique blend of natural beauty, engineering feats, and community spirit.\n\nHistory\n\n### Mill town (1826–1887)\n\nBritannia Village was founded in 1826 as a mill town, with the construction of the Britannia sawmill by Captain John LeBreton. The sawmill was one of the first industries in the area, and it played a crucial role in the development of the village. The sawmill was followed by other industries, including a gristmill, a shingle mill, and a carding mill, which helped to establish Britannia as a thriving industrial center. The village was also an important stopover for travelers and traders, with the Ottawa River providing a vital transportation route.\n\n### Summer-cottage resort (1887–1960)\n\nIn the late 19th century, Britannia Village began to transform into a popular summer-cottage resort. The village's scenic beauty, with its wooded hills and riverfront location, made it an attractive destination for wealthy Ottawa residents seeking to escape the city heat. Many summer cottages were built during this period, often featuring large verandas, ornate woodwork, and other decorative flourishes. The village also became known for its recreational activities, including boating, fishing, and tennis.\n\n#### Engineering feats\n\nOne of the most notable engineering feats in Britannia Village was the construction of the Deschênes Rapids canal, which was completed in 1830. The canal allowed ships to bypass the treacherous Deschênes Rapids, which had previously made navigation of the Ottawa River difficult. The canal was an important achievement, as it enabled the transportation of goods and people between Ottawa and the Great Lakes.\n\n#### Britannia Amusement Park\n\nIn the early 20th century, Britannia Village was also home to the Britannia Amusement Park, a popular destination for families and thrill-seekers. The park featured a range of attractions, including roller coasters, Ferris wheels, and other amusement rides. The park was a major draw for visitors from Ottawa and beyond, and it helped to cement Britannia's reputation as a lively and entertaining destination.\n\n### Rural commuter town (1960–2000)\n\nIn the post-war period, Britannia Village underwent another significant transformation, as it became a rural commuter town. Many residents of the village commuted to Ottawa for work, while still enjoying the peace and tranquility of the rural surroundings. The village continued to grow and develop during this period, with new homes and businesses being built to serve the needs of the expanding population.\n\n### Revitalization (since 2000)\n\nIn recent years, Britannia Village has undergone a revitalization, as new residents and businesses have moved into the area. The village has become a popular destination for families and young professionals, who are attracted by its natural beauty, community spirit, and proximity to Ottawa.\n\n#### Flood proofing\n\nOne of the major challenges facing Britannia Village is the risk of flooding, which has occurred several times in the village's history. In recent years, the City of Ottawa has implemented a range of flood-proofing measures, including the construction of a new dike system and the upgrading of the village's stormwater management infrastructure. These measures have helped to reduce the risk of flooding and protect the village's homes and businesses.\n\n#### Gentrification\n\nBritannia Village has also experienced gentrification in recent years, as new residents and businesses have moved into the area. While gentrification has brought new investment and energy to the village, it has also raised concerns about the displacement of long-time residents and the loss of the village's traditional character.\n\nHeritage buildings and architectural style\n\nBritannia Village is home to many heritage buildings, which reflect the village's rich history and architectural style. Many of the village's oldest buildings date back to the 19th century, and feature traditional materials such as wood, stone, and brick.\n\n### Addresses of buildings with heritage status\n\nSome of the notable heritage buildings in Britannia Village include:\n\n* 273 Britannia Road: This historic home was built in the 1860s and features a classic Italianate design.\n* 315 Britannia Road: This charming cottage was built in the 1870s and features a picturesque veranda and ornate woodwork.\n* 401 Britannia Road: This historic gristmill was built in the 1840s and features a traditional stone façade.\n\n### Heritage attributes in modern residences\n\nWhile many of Britannia Village's heritage buildings have been preserved and restored, the village is also home to many modern residences that incorporate heritage attributes. These homes often feature traditional materials and design elements, such as wood siding, stone foundations, and decorative woodwork.\n\nCharacter\n\nBritannia Village is a unique and characterful community, with a strong sense of history and tradition. The village is known for its natural beauty, with its wooded hills and riverfront location making it a popular destination for outdoor enthusiasts. The village is also home to a range of community events and activities, including the annual Britannia Village Fair and the Britannia Village Christmas Market.\n\nNotables in the community\n\nBritannia Village has been home to many notable residents over the years, including:\n\n* Captain John LeBreton, who founded the village in 1826 and built the Britannia sawmill.\n* Thomas McKay, who built the Rideau Canal and was a prominent businessman and politician in the region.\n* Sir John A. Macdonald, who was a frequent visitor to the village and often stayed at the Britannia Hotel.\n\nNotes\n\nBritannia Village is a unique and historic community that offers a range of attractions and activities for visitors. From its natural beauty and heritage buildings to its community events and recreational activities, the village is a must-visit destination for anyone interested in history, culture, and the great outdoors.\n\nReferences\n\n(Sources)\n\n(Note: This article does not include any citations or references, as per the requirements.)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Britannia_Village,_Ottawa\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Mill town (1826–1887)\n##Summer-cottage resort (1887–1960)\n###Engineering feats\n###Britannia Amusement Park\n##Rural commuter town (1960–2000)\n##Revitalization (since 2000)\n###Flood proofing\n###Gentrification\n#Heritage buildings and architectural style\n##Addresses of buildings with heritage status\n##Heritage attributes in modern residences\n#Character\n#Notables in the community\n#Notes\n#References\n##Sources\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The school is characterized by its emphasis on the rule of law, the importance of a strong centralized state, and the use of punishment and reward to maintain social order. Legalists believed that human nature is inherently selfish and that people can only be governed through the use of laws and punishments.\n\nRetrospective current\n--------------------\n\nThe term \"Legalism\" was not used during the Warring States period. Instead, the school was known as the Fa School, or the school of law. The term \"Legalism\" was first used by the Han Dynasty historian Sima Qian to describe the philosophical school.\n\n### Chapter 43 Ding fa\n\nThe concept of law and punishment was first discussed in the chapter \"Ding fa\" of the book \"Guanzi\", which dates back to the 4th century BCE. The chapter discusses the importance of establishing clear laws and punishments to maintain social order.\n\n### Imperial Confucian category\n\nDuring the Han Dynasty, the Fa School was categorized as one of the nine schools of thought, along with Confucianism, Taoism, and others. The Fa School was seen as a distinct school of thought that emphasized the importance of law and punishment.\n\nMilitary mobilization\n--------------------\n\nLegalism was closely tied to the military mobilization of the Warring States period. The school's emphasis on a strong centralized state and the use of punishment and reward to maintain social order was seen as essential for military success.\n\nSima Qian\n----------\n\nSima Qian, a historian of the Han Dynasty, was one of the first to write about the Fa School. He described the school as emphasizing the importance of law and punishment, and saw it as a distinct school of thought.\n\nHuang-Lao and Mawangdui\n----------------------\n\nThe discovery of the Mawangdui silk manuscripts in the 1970s shed new light on the relationship between Huang-Lao and the Fa School.\n\n### Huang-Lao and Laozi\n\nThe Mawangdui manuscripts reveal that Huang-Lao, a school of thought that emphasized the importance of the Tao, was closely tied to the Fa School. The manuscripts also show that Laozi, the founder of Taoism, was influenced by the Fa School.\n\n### Shen Dao and Zhuangzi\n\nThe Mawangdui manuscripts also reveal that Shen Dao, a philosopher who emphasized the importance of law and punishment, was influenced by Zhuangzi, a Taoist philosopher.\n\nChanging with the times\n----------------------\n\nThe Fa School was not a static school of thought. It evolved over time, and different philosophers contributed to its development.\n\n### A.C. Graham\n\nThe philosopher A.C. Graham saw the Fa School as a dynamic school of thought that changed over time. He argued that the school's emphasis on law and punishment was a response to the changing times.\n\nConfucian influences\n-------------------\n\nThe Fa School was influenced by Confucianism, which emphasized the importance of morality and ethics.\n\n### Shen Dao\n\nShen Dao, a philosopher who emphasized the importance of law and punishment, was influenced by Confucianism. He argued that law and punishment were necessary to maintain social order, but also emphasized the importance of morality and ethics.\n\nXing-Ming and Wu wei\n-------------------\n\nThe Fa School emphasized the importance of Xing-Ming, or the use of punishments and rewards to maintain social order. The school also emphasized the importance of Wu wei, or the use of non-action to achieve goals.\n\nHan Feizi\n----------\n\nHan Feizi, a philosopher who lived during the Warring States period, was a key figure in the Fa School. He emphasized the importance of law and punishment, and argued that the ruler should use punishments and rewards to maintain social order.\n\n### Daodejing 17\n\nThe Daodejing, a classic Taoist text, describes the use of Wu wei, or non-action, to achieve goals. Han Feizi argued that the ruler should use Wu wei to maintain social order.\n\nSchool of names\n----------------\n\nThe Fa School was also influenced by the School of Names, which emphasized the importance of logic and reason.\n\nEradicating punishments\n----------------------\n\nThe Fa School emphasized the importance of eradicating punishments, rather than simply using them to maintain social order.\n\n### Han Feizi\n\nHan Feizi argued that the ruler should use punishments and rewards to maintain social order, but also emphasized the importance of eradicating punishments. He argued that the ruler should use punishments to correct wrongdoing, rather than simply to maintain power.\n\n### Justice\n\nThe Fa School emphasized the importance of justice, and argued that the ruler should use punishments and rewards to maintain justice. However, the school also recognized that justice was not always easy to achieve, and that the ruler should use discretion when applying punishments and rewards.\n\nSources in Legalist Mythos\n---------------------------\n\nThe Fa School has a rich mythological tradition, with many stories and legends about its founders and key figures.\n\n### Jia Yi (200–169 BCE)\n\nJia Yi, a philosopher who lived during the Han Dynasty, wrote about the Fa School and its founders. He described the school as emphasizing the importance of law and punishment, and saw it as a distinct school of thought.\n\n### Liu An (179–122 BCE)\n\nLiu An, a philosopher who lived during the Han Dynasty, also wrote about the Fa School. He described the school as emphasizing the importance of law and punishment, and saw it as a key part of Chinese philosophy.\n\n### The Fa School\n\nThe Fa School has a rich tradition of stories and legends about its founders and key figures. The school's emphasis on law and punishment is seen as a key part of its philosophy, and its use of punishments and rewards to maintain social order is seen as essential for a strong and stable state.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nSources\n-------\n\nExternal links\n--------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Legalism_(Chinese_philosophy)\" following this outline:\n\n#Retrospective current\n##Chapter 43 Ding fa\n##Imperial Confucian category\n#Military mobilization\n#Sima Qian\n#Huang-Lao and Mawangdui\n##Huang-Lao and Laozi\n##Shen Dao and Zhuangzi\n#Changing with the times\n##A.C.

The term has gained significant attention on social media and has sparked discussions about the film industry, marketing strategies, and audience behavior.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\n### Release date dispute\n\nThe release date of \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" was initially met with controversy, as some critics argued that the simultaneous release would result in a divided audience and negatively impact the box office performance of one or both films. However, the studios behind the films, Warner Bros. and Universal Pictures, respectively, maintained that the release date was strategically chosen to maximize exposure and appeal to different demographics.\n\n#### Public reaction\n\nThe public reaction to the simultaneous release was mixed, with some fans expressing excitement at the prospect of watching two highly anticipated films on the same day, while others expressed concern that the films would cannibalize each other's box office earnings. Social media platforms were filled with discussions and debates about the release date, with some users creating memes and jokes about the \"Barbenheimer\" phenomenon.\n\n### Marketing\n\nThe marketing campaigns for \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" were highly publicized, with both films receiving significant attention from fans and critics alike. The trailers for both films were widely shared on social media, and the films' promotional materials, including posters and merchandise, were highly sought after by fans.\n\n### Double feature viewing\n\nIn response to the simultaneous release, some theaters offered double feature viewings of \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\", allowing fans to watch both films back-to-back. This move was seen as a way to capitalize on the buzz surrounding the films and to provide fans with a unique viewing experience.\n\nReception\n----------\n\n### Box office\n\n#### Projections\n\nPrior to the release of the films, box office projections were highly variable, with some analysts predicting that \"Barbie\" would outperform \"Oppenheimer\", while others predicted that the reverse would be true.\n\n#### Gross\n\nAccording to box office reports, \"Barbie\" grossed over $150 million in its opening weekend, while \"Oppenheimer\" grossed over $80 million. While both films performed well at the box office, \"Barbie\" ultimately outperformed \"Oppenheimer\" in terms of opening weekend gross.\n\n### Film industry reaction\n\nThe film industry reaction to the simultaneous release of \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" was mixed, with some industry insiders praising the move as a bold and innovative marketing strategy, while others expressed concern that the release date would negatively impact the box office performance of one or both films.\n\n### Japanese response\n\nIn Japan, the simultaneous release of \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" was met with significant interest, with both films performing well at the box office. The Japanese market has historically been receptive to Hollywood blockbusters, and the release of \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" was no exception.\n\n### Analysis\n\nAnalysis of the box office performance of \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" suggests that the simultaneous release did not have a significant impact on the box office earnings of either film. In fact, some analysts argue that the simultaneous release may have actually helped to boost box office earnings, as fans were more likely to attend theaters to see one or both films.\n\n### Reviews\n\nReviews of \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" were largely positive, with both films receiving praise from critics for their performances, direction, and production values. However, some critics noted that the films were not without their flaws, with some arguing that \"Barbie\" was overly reliant on nostalgia and that \"Oppenheimer\" was overly long.\n\n### Accolades\n\nBoth \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" received numerous accolades, including several award nominations. While neither film ultimately took home any major awards, the recognition was seen as a testament to the quality of the films and the hard work of the cast and crew.\n\nCounterprogramming\n-----------------\n\n### Potential \"Glicked\" phenomenon\n\nThe simultaneous release of \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" has raised questions about the potential for a \"Glicked\" phenomenon, in which the release of two or more films with similar themes or demographics leads to a divided audience and negatively impacts box office earnings. However, analysis suggests that the \"Glicked\" phenomenon may be overstated, and that the simultaneous release of \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" did not have a significant impact on box office earnings.\n\nNotes\n-----\n\n* The term \"Barbenheimer\" was popularized on social media platforms, including Twitter and Instagram.\n* The simultaneous release of \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" was seen as a bold marketing strategy by some industry insiders.\n* The films' promotional materials, including trailers and posters, were widely shared on social media.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* \"Barbie\" (2023 film)\n* \"Oppenheimer\" (2023 film)\n* Simultaneous release\n* Film marketing\n* Box office\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n* (Note: This section is intentionally blank, as per the requirements.)\n\nFurther reading\n---------------\n\n* (Note: This section is intentionally blank, as per the requirements.)\n\nExternal links\n--------------\n\n* (Note: This section is intentionally blank, as per the requirements.)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Barbenheimer\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Release date dispute\n###Public reaction\n##Marketing\n##Double feature viewing\n#Reception\n##Box office\n###Projections\n###Gross\n##Film industry reaction\n##Japanese response\n##Analysis\n##Reviews\n##Accolades\n#Counterprogramming\n##Potential \"Glicked\" phenomenon\n#Notes\n#See also\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

While the Games were a celebration of athletic achievement and international unity, they were also marred by various concerns and controversies. This article provides an overview of the criticisms, issues, and debates surrounding the 2022 Winter Olympics.\n\n# Criticism of host selection\n\nThe selection of Beijing as the host city for the 2022 Winter Olympics was met with criticism from various quarters. Many expressed concerns about China's human rights record, particularly with regards to the treatment of Uighur Muslims in the Xinjiang region. Others pointed to the environmental impact of hosting the Games in a city with severe air pollution problems. Additionally, there were concerns about the lack of snowfall in Beijing, which would require the use of artificial snow for many events.\n\n# Organizing concerns and controversies\n\n## Cost and climate\n\nThe 2022 Winter Olympics were one of the most expensive Games in history, with estimated costs of over $38 billion. The high cost was attributed to the need to build new infrastructure, including venues, transportation systems, and accommodation for athletes and officials. The Games also took place during a period of extreme cold weather, with temperatures often dropping below -20°C. This posed challenges for athletes, officials, and spectators, particularly those not accustomed to such conditions.\n\n## Promotional song\n\nThe promotional song for the 2022 Winter Olympics, titled \"Winter Dreams,\" was criticized for its perceived lack of cultural sensitivity. The song featured lyrics that some interpreted as dismissive of China's human rights record and environmental concerns. Others felt that the song did not adequately reflect the spirit of the Olympics or the host city.\n\n# Diplomatic boycotts or non-attendance\n\nSeveral countries, including the United States, Australia, and India, announced diplomatic boycotts of the 2022 Winter Olympics. This meant that while athletes from these countries would still participate in the Games, their governments would not send official representatives.\n\n## Background\n\nThe diplomatic boycotts were largely in response to China's human rights record, particularly with regards to the treatment of Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang. The United States, in particular, had imposed sanctions on several Chinese officials and entities over alleged human rights abuses.\n\n## United States\n\nThe United States was one of the first countries to announce a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki stated that the boycott was in response to China's \"ongoing genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang.\" The United States also imposed sanctions on several Chinese officials and entities over alleged human rights abuses.\n\n## Australia\n\nAustralia followed the United States in announcing a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison stated that the boycott was in response to China's \"human rights abuses in Xinjiang\" and \"other issues.\" Australia also imposed sanctions on several Chinese officials and entities over alleged human rights abuses.\n\n## India\n\nIndia also announced a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics, citing concerns over China's human rights record and border disputes between the two countries.\n\n## Calls for boycotts by other countries\n\nSeveral other countries, including the United Kingdom, Canada, and Germany, were urged to join the diplomatic boycotts. However, these countries ultimately decided not to participate in the boycotts, citing the importance of maintaining diplomatic relations with China.\n\n## Chinese Government response\n\nThe Chinese government responded to the diplomatic boycotts by accusing participating countries of \"politicizing\" the Olympics. Chinese officials also stated that the boycotts would not affect the success of the Games.\n\n## IOC response\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) responded to the diplomatic boycotts by stating that the Olympics were a \"celebration of athletic achievement and international unity.\" The IOC also emphasized the importance of maintaining diplomatic relations between participating countries.\n\n# Athletes and team officials complaints\n\nSeveral athletes and team officials expressed complaints about various aspects of the 2022 Winter Olympics.\n\n## Quarantine facilities\n\nSome athletes and officials expressed concerns about the quarantine facilities provided for those who tested positive for COVID-19. The facilities were criticized for being inadequate and uncomfortable.\n\n## Food\n\nSeveral athletes and officials expressed dissatisfaction with the food provided at the Olympic Village. Some complained that the food was unhealthy, while others felt that it was not suitable for their dietary needs.\n\n## Weather conditions\n\nAthletes and officials also expressed concerns about the extreme cold weather conditions during the Games. Some felt that the conditions were not suitable for certain events, while others expressed concerns about the impact on their health.\n\n# Team Russia\n\nTeam Russia was the subject of controversy during the 2022 Winter Olympics.\n\n## Russian invasion of Ukraine\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine took place during the 2022 Winter Olympics, leading to widespread condemnation from the international community. The IOC responded by stating that the Olympics were a \"celebration of athletic achievement and international unity,\" and that the invasion would not affect the success of the Games.\n\n# Environmental and health issues\n\nThe 2022 Winter Olympics were also marred by environmental and health issues.\n\n## Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the 2022 Winter Olympics, with many athletes and officials testing positive for the virus. The Games also took place during a period of rising COVID-19 cases in China, leading to concerns about the safety of participants.\n\n## Insufficient snowfall\n\nThe 2022 Winter Olympics were also affected by insufficient snowfall in Beijing. The lack of snow required the use of artificial snow for many events, which posed environmental concerns.\n\n## Energy crisis\n\nThe 2022 Winter Olympics were also marred by an energy crisis in China, which led to concerns about the sustainability of the Games.\n\n## Impact on Songshan National Nature Reserve\n\nThe construction of Olympic venues and infrastructure had a significant impact on the Songshan National Nature Reserve, a protected area in China. Environmentalists expressed concerns about the damage caused to the reserve and the potential long-term consequences.\n\n# Human rights issues\n\nThe 2022 Winter Olympics were also marred by human rights issues.\n\n## Sportswashing\n\nThe 2022 Winter Olympics were criticized for being used as a tool for \"sportswashing\" by the Chinese government. Sportswashing refers to the practice of using sports events to improve a country's public image and distract from human rights abuses.\n\n## Athlete safety\n\nThere were concerns about the safety of athletes participating in the 2022 Winter Olympics, particularly those from countries with poor human rights records.\n\n## Athletes' freedom of speech\n\nThere were also concerns about the freedom of speech of athletes participating in the 2022 Winter Olympics. Some athletes expressed fears about speaking out against human rights abuses or other issues, due to potential repercussions.\n\n## Protests\n\nThere were several protests during the 2022 Winter Olympics, including protests against the Chinese government's human rights record and treatment of Uighur Muslims.\n\n# Propaganda and information operations issues\n\nThe 2022 Winter Olympics were also marred by propaganda and information operations issues.\n\n## Propaganda and information operations\n\nThe Chinese government was accused of using propaganda and information operations to influence public opinion and shape the narrative around the 2022 Winter Olympics.\n\n## Censorship\n\nThere were reports of censorship during the 2022 Winter Olympics, including the censorship of negative news and criticism of the Chinese government.\n\n### Negative news censored during the games\n\nSeveral negative news stories were censored during the 2022 Winter Olympics, including stories about human rights abuses and environmental concerns.\n\n### Alleged suspension of US athlete's Twitter account\n\nThere were reports that the Twitter account of a US athlete was suspended during the 2022 Winter Olympics, allegedly due to criticism of the Chinese government.\n\n## Espionage directed at athletes\n\nThere were concerns about espionage directed at athletes participating in the 2022

With a rich history dating back to the pre-colonial era, Saint Lucia has evolved into a popular tourist destination and a thriving economy. This article provides an overview of the island's etymology, history, geography, government, economy, demographics, and culture.\n\n# Etymology\n\nThe origin of the name \"Saint Lucia\" is attributed to the French, who named the island after Saint Lucy of Syracuse, a 4th-century martyr. The name is derived from the Latin word \"Lucia,\" meaning \"light,\" which is fitting given the island's stunning natural beauty and radiant landscapes.\n\n# History\n\n## Pre-colonial period\n\nThe first inhabitants of Saint Lucia were the Arawak people, an indigenous tribe that migrated from the mainland hundreds of years before the arrival of European colonizers. The Arawak were later joined by the Carib people, a more aggressive tribe that eventually displaced the Arawak.\n\n## Early European period\n\nIn 1499, Christopher Columbus sighted Saint Lucia on his fourth voyage to the New World. The French established the first European settlement on the island in 1660, but it was soon abandoned due to conflicts with the Carib people. In 1722, the French re-established a settlement, which marked the beginning of European colonization.\n\n## 18th and 19th centuries\n\nDuring the 18th and 19th centuries, Saint Lucia changed hands between the French and British several times. The island was a prized possession due to its strategic location and fertile soil, which made it an ideal location for sugar plantations. The British eventually gained control of the island in 1814, and it remained a British colony until independence in 1979.\n\n## 20th century\n\nIn the early 20th century, Saint Lucia's economy began to shift from sugar production to tourism. The island's natural beauty, including its iconic twin volcanic peaks, the Pitons, made it an attractive destination for visitors. In 1967, Saint Lucia gained internal self-government, and on February 22, 1979, it became an independent nation.\n\n## Post-independence era\n\nSince gaining independence, Saint Lucia has continued to develop its economy and infrastructure. The island has invested heavily in tourism, with a focus on sustainable development and environmental protection. In 2011, Saint Lucia launched its National Strategic Plan, which aims to reduce poverty and promote economic growth.\n\n# Geography\n\n## Climate\n\nSaint Lucia has a tropical climate, with temperatures ranging from 22°C to 30°C (72°F to 86°F) throughout the year. The island experiences a wet season from June to November, with the majority of its rainfall occurring during this period.\n\n## Geology\n\nSaint Lucia is a volcanic island, with a terrain that is dominated by volcanic peaks, valleys, and beaches. The island's most iconic feature is the Pitons, two volcanic peaks that rise from the sea and are a symbol of the island's natural beauty.\n\n# Government\n\n## Administrative divisions\n\nSaint Lucia is divided into 10 administrative divisions, each with its own local government. The divisions are: Anse-la-Raye, Canaries, Castries, Choiseul, Dennery, Gros Islet, Laborie, Micoud, Soufrière, and Vieux Fort.\n\n## Law and crime\n\nSaint Lucia has a parliamentary democracy, with a prime minister as head of government. The island has a relatively low crime rate compared to other Caribbean nations, but there are still concerns about petty theft and violent crime.\n\n## Foreign relations\n\nSaint Lucia is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations and the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS). The island has diplomatic relations with several countries, including the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.\n\n# Economy\n\n## Tourism\n\nTourism is the largest sector of Saint Lucia's economy, accounting for over 60% of the island's GDP. The island's natural beauty, including its beaches, rainforests, and volcanic peaks, makes it an attractive destination for visitors.\n\n## Agriculture\n\nAgriculture is also an important sector of Saint Lucia's economy, with a focus on banana production, cocoa, and other crops. The island is self-sufficient in terms of food production, but it still imports some goods from other countries.\n\n## Infrastructure\n\nSaint Lucia has a well-developed infrastructure, with a international airport, seaport, and a network of roads and highways. The island is also investing in renewable energy, with a focus on solar and wind power.\n\n# Demographics\n\n## Ethnic groups\n\nSaint Lucia has a diverse population, with a mix of African, European, and indigenous influences. The majority of the population is of African descent, but there are also significant numbers of people of European and mixed ancestry.\n\n## Languages\n\nThe official language of Saint Lucia is English, but many people also speak Saint Lucian Creole, a dialect that is unique to the island.\n\n## Religion\n\nThe majority of Saint Lucians are Christian, with a significant number of Catholics and Protestants. There are also smaller numbers of people who practice other religions, including Hinduism and Islam.\n\n## Education\n\nEducation is compulsory in Saint Lucia, and the island has a well-developed education system.

Throughout his career, Stonehouse demonstrated exceptional skill and attention to detail, earning him a reputation as one of the finest bookbinders of his time.\n\n# Early life and family\n\nJohn Harrison Stonehouse was born in 1864 in London, England, to a family of modest means. His early life and education are not well-documented, but it is believed that he developed an interest in bookbinding at a young age. Stonehouse's entry into the trade was likely influenced by his father, who worked as a bookbinder in a small workshop in the city. As a young man, Stonehouse would have learned the skills and techniques of bookbinding through apprenticeships and hands-on training.\n\n# Career\n\nStonehouse's career as a bookbinder spanned several decades, during which he established himself as a master craftsman. His work was highly regarded by collectors, bibliophiles, and publishers, who sought his expertise in creating beautiful and durable bindings.\n\n## Cosway bindings\n\nStonehouse is perhaps best known for his work on Cosway bindings, a style of bookbinding that originated in the 19th century. Cosway bindings are characterized by intricate, inlaid designs, often featuring gold and silver filigree, as well as delicate paintings and ornaments. Stonehouse's Cosway bindings were renowned for their exceptional quality and attention to detail, and he was particularly skilled at creating complex, multi-colored designs.\n\n## The \"Great Omar\"\n\nOne of Stonehouse's most famous works is the \"Great Omar\", a magnificent, leather-bound edition of Edward FitzGerald's translation of The Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám. The \"Great Omar\" is considered one of the most beautiful and expensive books ever created, with a price tag that has exceeded $1 million at auction. Stonehouse's work on the \"Great Omar\" was a testament to his skill and craftsmanship, featuring intricate, inlaid designs and a stunning, gold-tooled leather binding.\n\n## Charles Dickens\n\nStonehouse was also known for his work on the novels of Charles Dickens, which he bound in exquisite, leather volumes. His Dickens bindings were highly prized by collectors, who sought his expertise in creating beautiful and durable bindings that would complement the author's works. Stonehouse's Dickens bindings featured intricate, gold-tooled designs and were often adorned with delicate, inlaid ornaments.\n\n# Death and legacy\n\nJohn Harrison Stonehouse died in 1938, at the age of 74, leaving behind a legacy as one of the finest bookbinders of his time. His work continues to be highly regarded by collectors, bibliophiles, and publishers, who seek his expertise in creating beautiful and durable bindings. Stonehouse's Cosway bindings, in particular, remain some of the most exquisite examples of bookbinding art, and his work on the \"Great Omar\" is a testament to his skill and craftsmanship.\n\n# Selected publications\n\n* The Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám (The \"Great Omar\")\n* The Works of Charles Dickens (various volumes)\n* The Plays of William Shakespeare (various volumes)\n* The Poems of Alfred, Lord Tennyson (various volumes)\n\n# References\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)\n\n# Further reading\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"John_Harrison_Stonehouse\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and family\n#Career\n##Cosway bindings\n##The \"Great Omar\"\n##Charles Dickens\n#Death and legacy\n#Selected publications\n#References\n#Further reading\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The Shahed 136 has gained significant attention in recent years due to its deployment in various conflict zones around the world, including the Yemeni Civil War and the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n# Overview\n\n## Description\n\nThe Shahed 136 is a loitering munition, also known as a \"kamikaze drone,\" designed to carry out attacks on specific targets. It is approximately 3.5 meters (11.5 feet) long, with a wingspan of around 2.5 meters (8.2 feet). The drone is powered by a small gasoline engine and has a reported range of up to 2,000 kilometers (1,243 miles). The Shahed 136 is equipped with a high-explosive warhead, which is designed to detonate upon impact.\n\n## Deployment\n\nThe Shahed 136 has been deployed by various forces, including the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and its proxies in the Middle East. The drone has also been used by Russian forces in Ukraine. The Shahed 136 is typically launched from a catapult or a truck-mounted launcher, and it can be controlled remotely or programed to fly autonomously to its target.\n\n## Comms and guidance system\n\nThe Shahed 136 uses a combination of GPS and inertial navigation systems to guide itself to its target. The drone also has a communication system that allows it to transmit video feed and receive commands from its operators. However, the exact details of the Shahed 136's communication and guidance systems are not publicly known.\n\n## Electronics\n\nThe Shahed 136 is equipped with various electronic systems, including a flight control system, a navigation system, and a payload system. The drone's electronic systems are designed to be relatively simple and reliable, allowing it to operate in a variety of environments.\n\n# Geran-2\n\nThe Geran-2 is a Russian variant of the Shahed 136, which has been used by Russian forces in Ukraine. The Geran-2 is believed to be assembled in Russia using components supplied by Iran. The Geran-2 has been used to attack Ukrainian cities and military targets, and it has been the subject of controversy due to its use in civilian areas.\n\n# Combat history\n\n## Yemeni Civil War\n\nThe Shahed 136 has been used by Houthi rebels in Yemen to attack Saudi and Emirati targets. The drone has been used to attack oil facilities, military bases, and other strategic targets. The Shahed 136 has been relatively effective in the Yemeni Civil War, allowing the Houthis to launch long-range attacks against their enemies.\n\n## Russian invasion of Ukraine\n\n### First appearances\n\nThe Shahed 136 first appeared in Ukraine in September 2022, when Russian forces began using the drone to attack Ukrainian targets. The drone was initially used to attack military targets, but it soon began to be used against civilian areas as well.\n\n### October waves\n\nIn October 2022, Russia launched a series of drone attacks against Ukrainian cities, including Kyiv, Lviv, and Kharkiv. The Shahed 136 was used extensively in these attacks, which caused significant damage and civilian casualties.\n\n### Ukrainian defense\n\nThe Ukrainian military has developed various tactics to defend against the Shahed 136, including the use of anti-aircraft missiles and electronic warfare systems. However, the drone remains a significant threat to Ukrainian forces and civilians.\n\n### Production in Russia\n\nThere have been reports that Russia is producing the Shahed 136 domestically, using components supplied by Iran. If true, this would allow Russia to increase its production of the drone and use it more extensively in Ukraine.\n\n### Reactions\n\nThe use of the Shahed 136 in Ukraine has been widely condemned by Western countries, which have accused Russia of using the drone to attack civilian targets. The drone has also been the subject of controversy due to its Iranian origin and the role of Iranian forces in Ukraine.\n\n## 2022 Syria and Iraqi Kurdistan\n\nIn 2022, the Shahed 136 was used by Iranian forces to attack targets in Syria and Iraqi Kurdistan. The drone was used to attack Kurdish militant groups and other targets in the region.\n\n## 2023 Indian Ocean\n\nIn 2023, the Shahed 136 was reportedly used by Iranian forces to attack a tanker in the Indian Ocean. The drone was used to attack the tanker, which was carrying oil from Iran to China.\n\n## 2024 Iranian strikes on Israel\n\nIn 2024, Iranian forces used the Shahed 136 to attack targets in Israel. The drone was used to attack military bases and other strategic targets in northern Israel.\n\n# Classification controversy\n\nThere has been controversy over the classification of the Shahed 136, with some experts describing it as a cruise missile and others as a drone. The drone's use of a high-explosive warhead and its ability to loiter over a target area have led some to classify it as a cruise missile.\n\n# Relations with other Shahed drones\n\n## Shahed 131\n\nThe Shahed 131 is a smaller version of the Shahed 136, which is used for reconnaissance and surveillance missions. The Shahed 131 is believed to be used by Iranian forces and its proxies in the Middle East.\n\n## Shahed 238\n\nThe Shahed 238 is a larger version of the Shahed 136, which is used for long-range attacks. The Shahed 238 is believed to be used by Iranian forces and its proxies in the Middle East.\n\n# Operators\n\nThe Shahed 136 is operated by various forces, including the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and its proxies in the Middle East. The drone is also used by Russian forces in Ukraine.\n\n# See also\n\n* Iranian military industry\n* Russian military industry\n* Drone warfare\n* Loitering munition\n\n# External links\n\n* Iranian Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics\n* Russian Ministry of Defense", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"HESA_Shahed_136\" following this outline:\n\n#Overview\n##Description\n##Deployment\n##Comms and guidance system\n##Electronics\n#Geran-2\n#Combat history\n##Yemeni Civil War\n##Russian invasion of Ukraine\n###First appearances\n###October waves\n###Ukrainian defense\n###Production in Russia\n###Reactions\n##2022 Syria and Iraqi Kurdistan\n##2023 Indian Ocean\n##2024 Iranian strikes on Israel\n#Classification controversy\n#Relations with other Shahed drones\n##Shahed 131\n##Shahed 238\n#Operators\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He is the longest-serving President in Italian history, having served two consecutive terms. Napolitano is a prominent figure in Italian politics, known for his commitment to social democracy and his efforts to promote national unity and stability.\n\n#Early life\n\nGiorgio Napolitano was born on June 29, 1925, in Naples, Italy. His father, Giovanni Napolitano, was a lawyer, and his mother, Carolina Bobbio, was a schoolteacher. Napolitano's family was middle-class and had a strong tradition of liberalism and anti-fascism. He grew up in a cultural and intellectually stimulating environment, which encouraged his interest in politics and social issues.\n\nNapolitano studied law at the University of Naples, where he became involved in anti-fascist activities and joined the Italian Communist Party (PCI) in 1945. After completing his studies, he worked as a lawyer and began to build a reputation as a prominent figure in the PCI.\n\n#Early political career\n\n##World War II and anti-fascist resistance\n\nDuring World War II, Napolitano participated in the Italian resistance against the fascist regime of Benito Mussolini. He was involved in various anti-fascist activities, including the distribution of underground newspapers and the organization of strikes and protests. After the war, Napolitano became a key figure in the PCI, which was one of the main parties in the Italian resistance.\n\n##From post-war years to the Hungarian Revolution of 1956\n\nIn the post-war period, Napolitano played an important role in the PCI, serving as a member of the party's central committee and as a deputy in the Italian parliament. He was a strong supporter of the PCI's policy of national unity and cooperation with other parties, and he worked closely with other prominent communist leaders, including Palmiro Togliatti.\n\nIn 1956, Napolitano was involved in the PCI's response to the Hungarian Revolution, which was a major challenge to the party's policies and ideology. He supported the PCI's decision to condemn the Soviet Union's suppression of the revolution, which marked a significant shift in the party's relations with the Soviet Union.\n\n#Leading member of the Italian Communist Party\n\n##From the 1960s to 1980s\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, Napolitano became one of the leading figures in the PCI, serving as a member of the party's politburo and as a deputy in the Italian parliament. He played a key role in the party's efforts to modernize and reform, and he was a strong supporter of the PCI's policy of Eurocommunism, which emphasized the importance of national independence and democracy.\n\nIn the 1980s, Napolitano served as the PCI's president, and he played a key role in the party's efforts to respond to the challenges of globalization and European integration. He was a strong supporter of the PCI's policy of cooperation with other parties, and he worked closely with other prominent communist leaders, including Enrico Berlinguer.\n\n#After the Italian Communist Party\n\n##President of the Chamber of Deputies\n\nIn 1992, Napolitano was elected as the President of the Chamber of Deputies, a position he held until 1994. During his presidency, he played a key role in the Italian parliament's efforts to respond to the challenges of corruption and organized crime.\n\n##Late 1990s and early 2000s\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, Napolitano served as a senator and as a member of the Italian parliament's foreign affairs committee. He was a strong supporter of Italy's membership in the European Union and NATO, and he played a key role in the country's efforts to promote European integration and international cooperation.\n\n#President of Italy\n\n##First term (2006–2013)\n\n###Election\n\nIn 2006, Napolitano was elected as the President of Italy, a position he held until 2013. He was the first former communist to hold the office, and his election marked a significant shift in Italian politics.\n\n###Prodi Cabinet\n\nDuring his first term, Napolitano worked closely with the government of Prime Minister Romano Prodi, which was a coalition of center-left parties. He played a key role in the government's efforts to promote economic reform and social justice, and he was a strong supporter of Italy's membership in the European Union.\n\n###2008 political crisis\n\nIn 2008, Napolitano played a key role in the Italian parliament's efforts to respond to a major political crisis, which was triggered by the collapse of the Prodi government. He worked closely with the leaders of the main parties to promote a resolution to the crisis, and he played a key role in the formation of a new government led by Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.\n\n###Eluana Englaro incident\n\nIn 2009, Napolitano was involved in a major controversy over the case of Eluana Englaro, a woman who had been in a coma for 17 years and whose family had sought to have her life support systems removed. Napolitano refused to sign a law that would have allowed the removal of Englaro's life support systems, citing concerns about the implications of the law for the rights of vulnerable people.\n\n###2011 political crisis\n\nIn 2011, Napolitano played a key role in the Italian parliament's efforts to respond to a major political crisis, which was triggered by the collapse of the Berlusconi government. He worked closely with the leaders of the main parties to promote a resolution to the crisis, and he played a key role in the formation of a new government led by Prime Minister Mario Monti.\n\n##Second term (2013–2015)\n\n###Re-election\n\nIn 2013, Napolitano was re-elected as the President of Italy, a position he held until 2015. His re-election marked a significant shift in Italian politics, and it was seen as a vote of confidence in his efforts to promote national unity and stability.\n\n###Letta Cabinet\n\nDuring his second term, Napolitano worked closely with the government of Prime Minister Enrico Letta, which was a coalition of center-left and center-right parties. He played a key role in the government's efforts to promote economic reform and social justice, and he was a strong supporter of Italy's membership in the European Union.\n\n###Renzi Cabinet\n\nIn 2014, Napolitano worked closely with the government of Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, which was a coalition of center-left parties. He played a key role in the government's efforts to promote economic reform and social justice, and he was a strong supporter of Italy's membership in the European Union.\n\n##Resignation\n\nIn January 2015, Napolitano announced his resignation as the President of Italy, citing his advanced age and his desire to step down from public life. His resignation marked the end of an era in Italian politics, and it was seen as a significant shift in the country's leadership.\n\n##Later life\n\nAfter his resignation, Napolitano retired from public life and devoted himself to his family and his personal interests. He remains a prominent figure in Italian politics, and he continues to be involved in various cultural and intellectual activities.\n\n#Personal life\n\n##Relations with the Catholic Church\n\nNapolitano has always had a complex relationship with the Catholic Church, which has been a major force in Italian politics and society.

He is remembered as a strong supporter of social democracy and European integration, and he played a key role in promoting national unity and stability in Italy.

The incident sparked widespread controversy and diplomatic tensions between the United States and China. This article provides an overview of the background, incident, and responses related to the 2023 Chinese balloon incident.\n\n# Background\n\n## History and Development of Reconnaissance Balloons\n\nReconnaissance balloons have been used for military surveillance and espionage since the mid-20th century. The United States, Soviet Union, and China have all developed and employed high-altitude balloons for various purposes, including signals intelligence gathering, photographic reconnaissance, and communication relay.\n\n### Past Chinese Balloons and Unidentified Objects\n\nChina has a history of launching high-altitude balloons for scientific research and military purposes. In the 1990s, China launched a series of high-altitude balloons for atmospheric research, some of which strayed into neighboring countries' airspace. In recent years, the United States has detected and tracked several unidentified aerial objects, including balloons, entering its airspace.\n\n## U.S.–China Tensions\n\nThe 2023 Chinese balloon incident occurred against the backdrop of escalating tensions between the United States and China. The two nations have been engaged in a series of disputes over issues such as trade, security, and human rights. The incident added to the existing tensions, with both sides accusing each other of aggressive behavior.\n\n# Incident\n\n## Balloon\n\n### Size, Propulsion, and Payload\n\nThe Chinese balloon was described as a large, high-altitude balloon, approximately 200 feet (61 meters) tall, with a payload estimated to be around 2,000 pounds (907 kilograms). The balloon was equipped with solar panels and a propulsion system, allowing it to maneuver and adjust its altitude.\n\n### Signals Intelligence Capabilities\n\nThe balloon was reportedly equipped with signals intelligence (SIGINT) capabilities, including sensors and antennas designed to intercept and collect communications signals. The exact nature and extent of the balloon's SIGINT capabilities are unclear.\n\n## Detection\n\nThe Chinese balloon was first detected by the United States on January 28, 2023, when it entered Alaskan airspace. The balloon was initially thought to be a weather balloon, but subsequent tracking and analysis revealed its true nature.\n\n## Flight Path\n\nThe balloon flew over the northern United States, passing over several sensitive military installations, including Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana, which is home to a fleet of Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles. The balloon's flight path raised concerns about the potential for espionage and surveillance.\n\n## U.S. Monitoring and Counterintelligence\n\nThe United States monitored the balloon's flight path and activities closely, using a combination of radar, satellite imagery, and human intelligence. The U.S. military also deployed F-22 fighter jets to intercept and escort the balloon, in preparation for potential downing.\n\n## Downing\n\nOn February 4, 2023, a U.S. F-22 fighter jet shot down the Chinese balloon off the coast of South Carolina, using a single AIM-9X Sidewinder missile. The downing was carried out at an altitude of approximately 60,000 feet (18,288 meters).\n\n## Debris Recovery\n\nThe United States Navy and Coast Guard recovered debris from the downed balloon, including the payload and solar panels. The recovered debris is currently being analyzed by U.S. intelligence agencies.\n\n# Legality of Airspace and Downing\n\nThe incident raised questions about the legality of the Chinese balloon's presence in U.S. airspace and the U.S. decision to down the balloon. The United States claimed that the balloon was a clear and present danger to national security, while China argued that the balloon was a civilian airship that had strayed into U.S. airspace by mistake.\n\n# Response and Reactions\n\n## United States\n\nThe United States government condemned the Chinese balloon's presence in U.S. airspace, describing it as a \"brazen\" and \"unacceptable\" act. The U.S. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, canceled a planned visit to China in response to the incident.\n\n## Canada\n\nCanada's Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, expressed concern about the incident and called for greater transparency from China. Canada also participated in the U.S.-led effort to track and monitor the balloon.\n\n## China\n\nChina's Foreign Ministry claimed that the balloon was a civilian airship used for scientific research, which had strayed into U.S. airspace by mistake. China also accused the United States of overreacting and using the incident as a pretext to escalate tensions.\n\n## NATO\n\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) expressed concern about the incident and called for greater transparency from China. NATO's Secretary-General, Jens Stoltenberg, described the incident as a \"serious\" and \"unacceptable\" act.\n\n## Australia\n\nAustralia's Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, expressed concern about the incident and called for greater transparency from China. Australia also participated in the U.S.-led effort to track and monitor the balloon.\n\n## Japan\n\nJapan's Prime Minister, Fumio Kishida, expressed concern about the incident and called for greater transparency from China. Japan also participated in the U.S.-led effort to track and monitor the balloon.\n\n## Singapore\n\nSingapore's Foreign Ministry expressed concern about the incident and called for greater transparency from China. Singapore also emphasized the importance of maintaining good relations with both the United States and China.\n\n## United Kingdom\n\nThe United Kingdom's Foreign Secretary, James Cleverly, expressed concern about the incident and called for greater transparency from China. The UK also participated in the U.S.-led effort to track and monitor the balloon.\n\n## Venezuela\n\nVenezuela's President, Nicolás Maduro, expressed support for China and accused the United States of engaging in a \"provocation\" against China.\n\n## Media Reactions\n\n### Analysis\n\nThe incident was widely analyzed in the media, with many commentators describing it as a significant escalation of tensions between the United States and China. Some analysts argued that the incident was a \"wake-up call\" for the United States to take a more assertive stance against Chinese aggression.\n\n### Satire\n\nThe incident was also satirized in the media, with some commentators using humor to highlight the absurdity of the situation. For example, one satirical article described the balloon as a \"high-altitude Trojan horse\" carrying a payload of \"spies, surveillance equipment, and a few spare dumplings\".\n\n# Other High-Altitude Objects in February 2023\n\nIn the days following the Chinese balloon incident, the United States detected and tracked several other high-altitude objects entering its airspace. These objects were later identified as balloons and drones, but their origins and purposes remain unclear.\n\n# Additional Assessments of the Balloon\n\nThe U.S. intelligence community has conducted a thorough assessment of the Chinese balloon, including its design, capabilities, and intentions. The assessment concluded that the balloon was a sophisticated surveillance platform designed to gather sensitive information about U.S. military installations and activities.\n\n# See Also\n\n* Chinese espionage in the United States\n* United States-China relations\n* Signals intelligence\n* Surveillance balloon\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a factual summary of the 2023 Chinese balloon incident.

The team is controlled by the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) and is a member of the Confederation of African Football (CAF) and the Union of Arab Football Associations (UAFA).\n\n# History\n\n## Pre-independence period\n\nFootball was introduced to Morocco in the late 19th century, and the first Moroccan club, the Association Sportive de Casablanca (ASC), was founded in 1904. However, it wasn't until the 1920s that football started to gain popularity in the country. The first Moroccan football championship was established in 1917, and the country's national team played its first unofficial match against France in 1928.\n\n## Beginning of Morocco (1955–1963)\n\nAfter Morocco gained independence from France in 1955, the country's football federation, the FRMF, was established in 1956. The team played its first official match against Iraq in 1957, and its first African Cup of Nations qualifying match against Tunisia in 1958. The team failed to qualify for the 1958 FIFA World Cup, but it did make its debut in the African Cup of Nations in 1962.\n\n## First appearances in international competitions (1963–1976)\n\nMorocco made its debut in the FIFA World Cup in 1970, where it lost to West Germany, Peru, and Bulgaria in the group stage. The team also participated in the 1972 and 1976 African Cup of Nations, where it finished third and second respectively. In 1976, Morocco qualified for the Olympic Games for the first time, where it reached the quarterfinals, where it lost to Poland.\n\n## Between successes and defeats (1976–1986)\n\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, Morocco experienced a mix of successes and defeats. The team qualified for the 1982 FIFA World Cup, where it drew with Poland and lost to England and France in the group stage. However, the team also won the 1976 African Games and finished second in the 1980 African Cup of Nations.\n\n## Golden generation (1986–2000)\n\nThe late 1980s and 1990s are considered the golden era of Moroccan football. The team qualified for the 1986 FIFA World Cup, where it reached the round of 16, where it lost to West Germany. The team also won the 1985 and 1995 Mediterranean Games, and finished second in the 1992 African Cup of Nations. In 1998, Morocco qualified for the FIFA World Cup for the fourth time, where it lost to Brazil, Norway, and Scotland in the group stage.\n\n## Difficult years (2006–2017)\n\nAfter the golden era, Moroccan football experienced a decline. The team failed to qualify for the 2006 and 2010 FIFA World Cups, and it also failed to advance past the group stage in the African Cup of Nations. However, the team did win the 2012 Arab Nations Cup and finished second in the 2014 African Nations Championship.\n\n## Second golden generation (2017–present)\n\nIn recent years, Moroccan football has experienced a resurgence. The team qualified for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, where it lost to Iran, Portugal, and Spain in the group stage. However, the team also won the 2018 African Nations Championship and finished second in the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations. In 2021, Morocco qualified for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, where it reached the quarterfinals, where it lost to France.\n\n# Home stadium\n\nThe Morocco national football team plays its home matches at the Adrar Stadium in Agadir, which has a capacity of 45,800. However, the team also plays its home matches at other stadiums, such as the Mohammed V Stadium in Casablanca, which has a capacity of 67,000, and the Moulay Abdellah Stadium in Rabat, which has a capacity of 52,000.\n\n# Kit suppliers\n\nThe Morocco national football team's kit supplier is Puma, which has been the team's kit supplier since 2015.\n\n# Results and fixtures\n\n## 2023\n\n* 24

However, as the industry has evolved, a growing concern has emerged regarding \"orphan wells,\" which are wells that have been abandoned by their operators and are no longer producing. These wells pose significant environmental and financial risks, and their management has become a pressing issue in the province. This article provides an overview of the current state of orphan wells in Alberta, their context, and the various stakeholders and organizations involved in their management.\n\n# Current Overview\n\nAs of 2022, there are approximately 170,000 inactive oil and gas wells in Alberta, with around 97,000 of these wells being orphaned. These wells are scattered throughout the province, with many located on private land and municipal properties. The sheer number of orphan wells poses significant environmental and financial risks, including the potential for soil and groundwater contamination, and the costs associated with their reclamation.\n\n# Context\n\nThe oil and gas industry in Alberta has experienced significant growth over the years, with many wells being drilled and operated during the 1970s and 1980s. However, as the industry has evolved, many of these wells have become uneconomical to operate, leading to their abandonment. In some cases, operators have gone bankrupt, leaving behind a legacy of orphan wells. The lack of regulations and oversight in the past has contributed to the proliferation of orphan wells, which has become a major concern for landowners, municipalities, and the province as a whole.\n\n# Landowners and Municipalities\n\nLandowners and municipalities in Alberta are significantly impacted by orphan wells, as they are often left to deal with the environmental and financial consequences of these wells. Many landowners have reported finding orphan wells on their properties, which can lead to decreased property values and increased environmental risks. Municipalities are also affected, as they may be responsible for providing services and infrastructure to areas with orphan wells. In some cases, municipalities have had to take on the responsibility of reclaiming orphan wells, which can be a costly and time-consuming process.\n\n# Orphan Well Association\n\nThe Orphan Well Association (OWA) is a non-profit organization established in 2002 to manage and reclaim orphan wells in Alberta. The OWA is funded by the oil and gas industry, and its mandate is to prioritize and reclaim orphan wells based on environmental and safety risks. The OWA works closely with landowners, municipalities, and the Alberta Energy Regulator to identify and manage orphan wells.\n\n# OWA Funding\n\n## Federal and Provincial Subsidies\n\nThe OWA receives funding from the federal and provincial governments, as well as from the oil and gas industry. In 2020, the federal government announced a $1.7 billion funding package to support the reclamation of orphan wells in Alberta and other provinces. The provincial government has also provided funding to support the OWA's work, including a $235 million loan in 2020. The oil and gas industry also contributes to the OWA's funding through a levy on industry members.\n\n# Alberta Energy Regulator\n\nThe Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) is responsible for regulating the oil and gas industry in Alberta, including the management of orphan wells. The AER sets regulations and guidelines for the industry, including requirements for well abandonment and reclamation. The AER also works closely with the OWA to identify and manage orphan wells.\n\n# Legal and Regulatory Considerations\n\n## Polluter Pays Principle\n\nThe polluter pays principle is a key concept in environmental regulation, which holds that those responsible for environmental pollution should bear the costs of cleanup and remediation. In the context of orphan wells, this principle is often applied to hold operators accountable for the environmental impacts of their wells. However, in many cases, operators have gone bankrupt or are no longer in existence, leaving behind a legacy of orphan wells.\n\n## Suspended Inactive Wells\n\nSuspended inactive wells are wells that have been temporarily suspended from production, often due to economic or technical reasons. These wells can pose significant environmental risks, as they may not be properly maintained or monitored. The AER has implemented regulations to require operators to properly suspend and abandon these wells, including requirements for regular inspections and maintenance.\n\n# Bankruptcies and Orphan Wells\n\n## Strategic Packaging of Costly Liabilities with Productive Assets\n\nIn some cases, operators have engaged in strategic packaging of costly liabilities, including orphan wells, with productive assets. This can involve selling off productive assets while leaving behind a legacy of orphan wells. This practice has been criticized for allowing operators to avoid their environmental responsibilities and shift the costs of reclamation onto the public.\n\n# Environmental Impacts of Orphan Wells\n\n## Fugitive Gas Emissions\n\nOrphan wells can be a significant source of fugitive gas emissions, including methane and other volatile organic compounds. These emissions can contribute to climate change and have negative impacts on air quality. In some cases, orphan wells can also be a source of odors and other environmental concerns.\n\n## Surface Casing Vent Flow (SCVF) and Gas Migration (GM)\n\nSurface casing vent flow (SCVF) and gas migration (GM) are two significant environmental concerns associated with orphan wells. SCVF occurs when gas or fluids escape from the wellbore and migrate to the surface, often through the casing or cement. GM occurs when gas or fluids migrate through the rock formation and escape at the surface. Both SCVF and GM can lead to environmental contamination and other concerns.\n\n# Potential Geothermal Conversion of Orphan Wells in Alberta\n\nThere is growing interest in the potential for geothermal conversion of orphan wells in Alberta. Geothermal conversion involves using the heat from the wellbore to generate electricity or provide heat for buildings and other applications. This can be a win-win solution, as it can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while also generating revenue from orphan wells.\n\n# Responses\n\nThe province of Alberta, the oil and gas industry, and other stakeholders have implemented various responses to address the issue of orphan wells. These responses include:\n\n* Increased funding for the OWA and other organizations involved in reclamation\n* Implementation of new regulations and guidelines for well abandonment and reclamation\n* Increased transparency and accountability for operators\n* Support for geothermal conversion and other alternative uses for orphan wells\n\n# See Also\n\n* Orphan wells\n* Oil and gas industry\n* Environmental regulation\n* Geothermal energy\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a general overview of the issue of orphan wells in Alberta, Canada.
