It encompasses a wide range of genres, styles, and themes, and has been an integral part of the film industry since its inception. Despite facing numerous challenges and biases, women have made significant contributions to the world of cinema, both behind and in front of the camera.\n\nFamous Women in Film History\n-----------------------------\n\n### Silent Films\n\nDuring the silent era, women played a crucial role in the development of cinema. Filmmakers like Alice Guy-Blaché, Loïe Fuller, and Mabel Normand were among the first women to make films. Guy-Blaché, in particular, is considered one of the first women to make a narrative film, with her 1896 short \"La Fée aux Choux.\" These women paved the way for future generations of female filmmakers.\n\n### Classical Hollywood\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, women like Dorothy Arzner, Ida Lupino, and Olivia de Havilland made significant contributions to Hollywood. Arzner was one of the first women to direct a feature film, with her 1927 film \"Fashions for Women.\" Lupino, an actress and director, was known for her work on films like \"The Hitch-Hiker\" (1953) and \"The Bigamist\" (1953). De Havilland, an actress, won two Academy Awards for Best Actress and was a pioneering figure in the fight for actors' rights.\n\n### Experimental and Avant-Garde Cinema\n\nWomen have also played a key role in experimental and avant-garde cinema. Filmmakers like Maya Deren, Shirley Clarke, and Barbara Rubin were known for pushing the boundaries of film as an art form. Deren's 1943 film \"Meshes of the Afternoon\" is considered a classic of experimental cinema, while Clarke's 1967 film \"Portrait of Jason\" is a groundbreaking work of documentary cinema.\n\nImpact on Society\n-------------------\n\n### Impact of Second-Wave Feminism\n\nThe second-wave feminist movement of the 1960s and 1970s had a significant impact on women's cinema. Filmmakers like Laura Mulvey, Claire Johnston, and Pam Cook were instrumental in developing feminist film theory and criticism. Mulvey's 1975 essay \"Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema\" is a seminal work in the field of feminist film theory.\n\n### Representing Sexuality\n\nWomen's cinema has also played a key role in representing female sexuality on screen.

Breillat's 1999 film \"Romance\" is a groundbreaking work in this area, while Campion's 1993 film \"The Piano\" is a critically acclaimed exploration of female desire.\n\n### Fear of Entering Cinematography\n\nDespite the many contributions of women to cinema, there are still barriers to entry for women in the film industry. Many women face sexism, harassment, and bias in their careers, which can make it difficult to break into the industry. This fear of entering cinematography can be a significant obstacle for women who want to pursue careers in film.\n\n### Statistics\n\nAccording to a 2020 report by the USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, women make up only 15% of directors, 20% of writers, and 25% of editors working on the top 100 films of 2019. These statistics highlight the ongoing underrepresentation of women in the film industry.\n\n### Documentaries\n\nDocumentaries have been a key area of women's cinema, with many women making important contributions to the genre. Filmmakers like Barbara Kopple, Kim Longinotto, and Laura Poitras have made critically acclaimed documentaries on a range of subjects. Kopple's 1976 film \"Harlan County, U.S.A.\" is a classic of documentary cinema, while Longinotto's 2005 film \"Sisters in Law\" is a groundbreaking work on women's rights.\n\n#### Female Filmmakers as Feminists\n\nMany female filmmakers have identified as feminists, using their work to explore themes of female empowerment and social justice. Filmmakers like Agnès Varda, Chantal Akerman, and Sally Potter have made significant contributions to feminist cinema. Varda's 1962 film \"Cléo from 5 to 7\" is a classic of feminist cinema, while Akerman's 1975 film \"Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles\" is a groundbreaking work on female domesticity.\n\n### Celluloid Ceiling\n\nThe term \"celluloid ceiling\" refers to the barriers that women face in the film industry, particularly in terms of career advancement. Despite the many contributions of women to cinema, there are still limited opportunities for women in key roles like directing, writing, and editing.\n\nNorth America\n--------------\n\n### Canada\n\nCanada has a thriving film industry, with many women making significant contributions to Canadian cinema.

The collapse was triggered by a combination of factors, including significant losses, instability, and a subsequent loss of confidence among depositors.\n\n# Background\n\nSilicon Valley Bank was founded in 1983 and was headquartered in Santa Clara, California. The bank was known for its expertise in serving technology and life science companies, providing a range of financial services, including loans, credit facilities, and cash management solutions. Over the years, SVB grew to become one of the largest banks in the United States, with over $200 billion in assets and more than 8,000 employees.\n\nSVB was particularly popular among startups and venture capital firms, which valued the bank's specialized services and expertise. The bank's strong relationships with the technology and life science communities enabled it to grow rapidly, and it became a key player in the Silicon Valley ecosystem.\n\n# Collapse\n\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank occurred over several days in March 2023, culminating in the bank's seizure by regulators. The events leading up to the collapse were complex and multifaceted, involving a combination of internal and external factors.\n\n## Losses\n\nIn the months leading up to the collapse, SVB reported significant losses on its investment portfolio, primarily due to a decline in the value of its bond holdings. The bank had invested heavily in long-term bonds, which were sensitive to changes in interest rates. As interest rates rose, the value of these bonds declined, resulting in significant losses for the bank.\n\n## Instability\n\nThe losses reported by SVB created instability among depositors, who began to question the bank's solvency. As depositors withdrew their funds, the bank's liquidity position deteriorated, making it increasingly difficult for the bank to meet its obligations.\n\n## Receivership\n\nOn March 10, 2023, the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) took possession of SVB and appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as receiver. The FDIC immediately took control of the bank's operations and began to wind down its affairs.\n\n## Acquisition\n\nOn March 26, 2023, the FDIC announced that it had sold SVB's assets to First Citizens Bank, a North Carolina-based bank. The sale included all of SVB's deposits, loans, and other assets, and was designed to minimize disruption to SVB's customers and the broader financial system.\n\n# Effects\n\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank had significant effects on customers, shareholders, the financial system, and the broader economy.\n\n## Customers\n\nThe collapse of SVB had a significant impact on the bank's customers, many of whom were small businesses and startups that relied on the bank for their financial needs. These customers faced uncertainty and disruption as they sought to access their funds and continue their operations.\n\n## Shareholders\n\nThe collapse of SVB also had a significant impact on the bank's shareholders, who saw the value of their investments decline sharply. The bank's stock price fell by over 90% in the days leading up to the collapse, wiping out billions of dollars in value.\n\n## Financial system\n\nThe collapse of SVB raised concerns about the stability of the financial system, particularly among smaller banks and financial institutions. Regulators and policymakers took steps to reassure the public and calm markets, but the event highlighted the ongoing risks and challenges facing the financial sector.\n\n## Legal actions\n\nIn the aftermath of the collapse, several lawsuits were filed against SVB and its executives, alleging misconduct and negligence. These lawsuits are ongoing, and it is unclear what the ultimate outcome will be.\n\n# Reactions\n\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank sparked a range of reactions from officials, policymakers, and commentators.\n\n## Official responses\n\nRegulators and policymakers responded quickly to the collapse, seeking to minimize disruption and reassure the public. The FDIC and other agencies took steps to ensure the continued stability of the financial system and to support affected customers.\n\n## Debate over government intervention\n\nThe collapse of SVB sparked a debate over the role of government intervention in the financial sector. Some argued that the government should have done more to prevent the collapse, while others argued that intervention would have created moral hazard and undermined market discipline.\n\n## Debate about causes\n\nThe collapse of SVB also sparked a debate about the underlying causes of the event. Some argued that the bank's business model was flawed, while others pointed to external factors such as rising interest rates and regulatory pressures.\n\n# See also\n\n* Bank failure\n* Financial crisis\n* Silicon Valley Bank\n* Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Collapse_of_Silicon_Valley_Bank\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Collapse\n##Losses\n##Instability\n##Receivership\n##Acquisition\n#Effects\n##Customers\n##Shareholders\n##Financial system\n##Legal actions\n#Reactions\n##Official responses\n##Debate over government intervention\n##Debate about causes\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

L. Zissu\n\nA. L. Zissu was a prominent Hasidic scholar, journalist, and Jewish leader who played a significant role in the Jewish community in Romania during the mid-20th century. His life's work was marked by a commitment to Jewish tradition, Zionism, and resistance against persecution. This article provides an overview of his biography, highlighting his notable achievements and the challenges he faced.\n\n# Biography\n\n## Hasidic scholar and journalistic debut\n\nA. L. Zissu was born into a family of Hasidic Jews in Romania. From a young age, he demonstrated a strong aptitude for Talmudic studies and became a respected scholar within his community. His expertise in Jewish law and tradition earned him recognition among the Jewish intellectuals of his time. In addition to his scholarly pursuits, Zissu developed an interest in journalism, which would become a crucial aspect of his career. He began writing for various Jewish publications, using his platform to advocate for Jewish rights and interests.\n\n## Religious Zionism\n\nZissu's involvement in journalism coincided with the rise of Religious Zionism, a movement that sought to combine traditional Jewish values with modern nationalist aspirations. He became an ardent supporter of this ideology, seeing it as a means to revitalize Jewish life and ensure the survival of the Jewish people. Through his writings, Zissu promoted the idea of a Jewish homeland in Palestine, which he believed would provide a safe haven for Jews facing persecution in Europe.\n\n## Nazi persecution\n\nThe outbreak of World War II and the subsequent occupation of Romania by Nazi Germany had a devastating impact on the Jewish community. Zissu, as a prominent Jewish leader and journalist, was particularly vulnerable to persecution. He faced harassment, intimidation, and eventually, arrest by the authorities. Despite these challenges, he continued to advocate for Jewish rights and interests, using his network of contacts to mobilize support for the Jewish community.\n\n## Resistance movement\n\nAs the Nazi occupation intensified, Zissu became involved in the Jewish resistance movement. He worked closely with other Jewish leaders to organize clandestine activities, including the smuggling of Jews out of Romania and the provision of aid to those in hiding. Zissu's involvement in the resistance movement put him at great personal risk, but he remained committed to the cause, driven by his determination to protect the Jewish community.\n\n## Jewish leadership\n\nIn the aftermath of the war, Zissu emerged as a leading figure in the Jewish community. He played a key role in rebuilding Jewish institutions and advocating for the rights of Jewish survivors. His leadership was marked by a commitment to Jewish tradition and a determination to ensure the long-term survival of the Jewish people. Zissu's work in this period was instrumental in shaping the post-war Jewish community in Romania.\n\n## Against communism\n\nAs the Communist Party consolidated its power in Romania, Zissu found himself at odds with the new authorities. He was vocal in his opposition to communist ideology, which he saw as a threat to Jewish tradition and identity. Zissu's criticism of communism made him a target for the authorities, who viewed him as a potential enemy of the state.\n\n## Securitate set-up and imprisonment\n\nIn 1956, Zissu was arrested by the Securitate, Romania's secret police, on charges of anti-communist activity. He was subjected to intense interrogation and eventually imprisoned for several years. The precise circumstances of his arrest and imprisonment remain unclear, but it is widely believed that he was set up by the authorities as part of a broader campaign to suppress dissent.\n\n## Trial, reprieve, and death\n\nZissu's trial was a sham, with the outcome predetermined by the authorities. He was found guilty of anti-communist activity and sentenced to several years in prison. However, following international pressure and protests from the Jewish community, his sentence was commuted, and he was released from prison. Zissu's health had been severely damaged by his imprisonment, and he died shortly after his release.\n\n# Legacy\n\nA. L. Zissu's legacy is complex and multifaceted. As a Hasidic scholar and journalist, he played a significant role in promoting Jewish tradition and advocating for Jewish rights. His involvement in the Jewish resistance movement during World War II demonstrated his courage and commitment to the Jewish community. Zissu's opposition to communism and his eventual imprisonment by the authorities cemented his reputation as a champion of Jewish freedom and identity. Today, he is remembered as a hero and a role model by the Jewish community in Romania and beyond.\n\n# Notes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"A._L._Zissu\" following this outline:\n\n#Biography\n##Hasidic scholar and journalistic debut\n##Religious Zionism\n##Nazi persecution\n##Resistance movement\n##Jewish leadership\n##Against communism\n##Securitate set-up and imprisonment\n##Trial, reprieve, and death\n#Legacy\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He was known for his record-breaking expeditions and his passion for exploring the world's most remote and inhospitable regions. Harding's life was marked by a series of remarkable achievements, from climbing the highest mountains to diving to the deepest parts of the ocean.\n\n#Early life and education\n\nHamish Harding was born on June 23, 1964, in London, England. He grew up in a family of modest means and was raised by his parents, who encouraged his sense of adventure and curiosity from an early age. Harding developed a passion for exploration and the outdoors, which would stay with him throughout his life.\n\nHarding was educated at the University of Oxford, where he studied geography and economics. During his time at university, he became involved in the Oxford University Exploration Club, which would later become a launching pad for his future expeditions.\n\n##Early expeditions\n\nAfter graduating from university, Harding began to embark on a series of expeditions that would take him to some of the most remote and inhospitable regions of the world. In 1987, he climbed Mount Kilimanjaro, the highest mountain in Africa, and in 1990, he completed a 3,000-mile journey across the Sahara Desert.\n\nThese early expeditions helped to establish Harding as a serious adventurer and explorer, and he began to attract attention from sponsors and media outlets. In 1992, he was awarded the Royal Geographical Society's Ness Award for his contributions to exploration.\n\n#Career and adventures\n\nIn the 1990s, Harding's expeditions became increasingly ambitious and high-profile. In 1993, he led an expedition to the North Pole, which became the first British team to reach the pole without support. In 1995, he climbed Mount Everest, the highest mountain in the world, via the challenging North Ridge route.\n\nHarding's expeditions often involved pushing the boundaries of human endurance and exploring new and uncharted territories. In 1997, he completed a 2,000-mile journey across the Amazon rainforest, and in 1999, he led an expedition to the South Pole, which became the first team to reach the pole from the coast without support.\n\n##Exploring the ocean\n\nIn the 2000s, Harding turned his attention to exploring the world's oceans. In 2003, he completed a 3,000-mile journey across the Atlantic Ocean in a rowing boat, and in 2005, he led an expedition to the deepest part of the ocean, the Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench.\n\nHarding's expeditions often involved working with scientists and researchers to collect data and conduct experiments. In 2007, he led an expedition to the Great Barrier Reef, which involved conducting research on the reef's coral and marine life.\n\n#Titan expedition and death\n\nIn 2019, Harding embarked on his most ambitious expedition to date, a journey to the Titan submersible, a deep-sea submersible that had been lost on the ocean floor for over 20 years. The expedition was led by Harding and involved a team of experts from around the world.\n\nOn June 18, 2023, Harding and his team successfully located the Titan submersible and began to explore the wreckage. However, during the dive, Harding's submersible experienced a catastrophic failure, and he was killed in the accident. The incident shocked the exploration community and marked the end of an era for one of the world's most renowned adventurers.\n\n#Personal life\n\nHarding was married to his wife, Linda, and had two children, a son and a daughter. He was known for his charismatic personality and his ability to inspire others to pursue their passions. Harding was also a prolific writer and published several books on his expeditions and adventures.\n\n##Philanthropy\n\nHarding was involved in several charitable organizations and was a strong supporter of conservation and environmental causes. In 2010, he founded the Hamish Harding Foundation, which provides funding and support for expeditions and research projects that promote conservation and exploration.\n\n#Awards and recognition\n\nHarding received numerous awards and recognition for his contributions to exploration and conservation. In 2001, he was awarded the Royal Geographical Society's Gold Medal, and in 2010, he was awarded the Explorers Club's Lowell Thomas Award.\n\n##Legacy\n\nHarding's legacy continues to inspire new generations of explorers and adventurers. His contributions to exploration and conservation have helped to promote a greater understanding of the world's most remote and inhospitable regions, and his passion for discovery has inspired countless others to pursue their own expeditions and adventures.\n\n#See also\n\n* List of explorers\n* List of mountaineers\n* List of deep-sea explorers\n* Royal Geographical Society\n* Explorers Club\n\n#References\n\nNone\n\n#External links\n\nNone", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Hamish_Harding\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and education\n#Career and adventures\n#Titan expedition and death\n#Personal life\n#Awards and recognition\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The team showed significant improvement, finishing as runners-up in the 2014 FIFA World Cup, where they lost to Germany in the quarterfinals.\n\n## Renewed success (2016–present)\n\nThe French team's resurgence continued with a victory in the 2016 UEFA European Championship, where they defeated Portugal 1-0 in the final.\n\nIn 2018, the team won the FIFA World Cup, defeating Croatia 4-2 in the final.

The storm brought heavy snowfall, high winds, and low visibility, causing widespread disruptions to transportation, communication, and daily life. The storm's impact was felt across several states and provinces, including Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, New York, Ontario, and Quebec.\n\n# Meteorological history\n\nThe Great Snowstorm of 1944 was a classic nor'easter, forming off the coast of North Carolina on December 1, 1944. The storm system moved northward, intensifying as it interacted with a cold front from Canada. As the storm approached the eastern seaboard, it began to take on a more northerly track, eventually making landfall in New Jersey on December 2. The storm's center then moved westward, passing over Pennsylvania and Ohio, before finally dissipating over Lake Erie on December 3.\n\nThe storm's meteorological characteristics were notable for their severity. Sustained winds of up to 60 mph (97 km/h) were reported, with gusts reaching as high as 80 mph (129 km/h). Snowfall totals were significant, with some areas receiving over 2 feet (61 cm) of snow. The snow was also extremely wet and heavy, causing widespread power outages and property damage.\n\n# Overall impact\n\nThe Great Snowstorm of 1944 had a profound impact on the affected regions. Transportation networks were severely disrupted, with roads, railways, and airports shut down due to heavy snow and high winds. Communication systems were also affected, with power outages and downed telephone lines making it difficult for people to stay in touch with loved ones.\n\nThe storm also had a significant economic impact, with businesses forced to close and supply chains disrupted. The storm's timing, just a few weeks before Christmas, made it particularly devastating for retailers and manufacturers.\n\n# Fatalities and injuries\n\nThe Great Snowstorm of 1944 was a deadly and destructive event, with at least 400 people killed and over 1,000 injured. The majority of fatalities were due to traffic accidents, hypothermia, and heart attacks brought on by shoveling snow. Many people were also trapped in their homes, unable to escape due to the heavy snow and high winds.\n\n# Impacts on most affected areas\n\n## Ohio\n\nOhio was one of the hardest-hit states, with the storm causing widespread power outages and property damage. The city of Cleveland was particularly affected, with over 20 inches (51 cm) of snow falling in a 24-hour period. The city's airport was shut down, and roads were impassable due to the heavy snow and high winds.\n\n## Pennsylvania\n\nPennsylvania was also severely affected, with the storm causing widespread disruptions to transportation and communication.

The blockade, which began on December 12, 2022, has led to a severe humanitarian crisis in Nagorno-Karabakh, with widespread shortages of food, medicine, and other essential supplies.\n\n# Background\n\n## First blockade (1989–2023) and isolation from Armenia (1989–1992)\n\nNagorno-Karabakh, a disputed territory in the South Caucasus, has been the subject of a longstanding conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. In 1989, Azerbaijan imposed a blockade on Nagorno-Karabakh, which lasted until 1992. During this period, the region was isolated from Armenia and the outside world, leading to severe shortages of food, medicine, and other essential supplies.\n\n## Threats to public utility infrastructure and entry\n\nIn the years leading up to the current blockade, there were repeated threats to the public utility infrastructure and entry points of Nagorno-Karabakh. In 2021, Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev threatened to cut off the gas supply to Nagorno-Karabakh, while in 2022, Azerbaijani forces blocked the entrance to the Lachin Corridor, the only land route connecting Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia.\n\n## Prelude\n\nThe current blockade of Nagorno-Karabakh began on December 12, 2022, when a group of Azerbaijani protesters, ostensibly environmental activists, blocked the Lachin Corridor. The protesters claimed that they were demonstrating against the alleged exploitation of natural resources in Nagorno-Karabakh by Armenia. However, the blockade has been widely condemned as a thinly veiled attempt by Azerbaijan to strangle the region economically and force its residents to flee.\n\n# Blockade timeline\n\n## 2022 events\n\n* December 12, 2022: A group of Azerbaijani protesters block the Lachin Corridor, cutting off Nagorno-Karabakh's only land route to Armenia.\n* December 13, 2022: The Armenian government accuses Azerbaijan of orchestrating the blockade and demands that it be lifted.\n* December 14, 2022: The Russian peacekeeping mission in Nagorno-Karabakh, which has been responsible for maintaining the ceasefire between Armenia and Azerbaijan since 2020, issues a statement calling for the blockade to be lifted.\n\n## 2023 events\n\n* January 2023: The blockade enters its second month, with reports of severe shortages of food, medicine, and other essential supplies in Nagorno-Karabakh.\n* February 2023: The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) begins to transport limited supplies of food and medicine to Nagorno-Karabakh through the Lachin Corridor.\n* March 2023: The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) issues an interim measure calling on Azerbaijan to lift the blockade and ensure the safe passage of humanitarian aid to Nagorno-Karabakh.\n\n# Humanitarian crisis\n\n## Lack of access to supplies and medical care\n\nThe blockade of Nagorno-Karabakh has led to a severe humanitarian crisis in the region, with widespread shortages of food, medicine, and other essential supplies. The lack of access to medical care has been particularly acute, with reports of patients being forced to travel to Armenia for treatment due to the lack of medical facilities in Nagorno-Karabakh.\n\n## Limited supplies transported by the Red Cross and the Russian peacekeepers\n\nDespite the efforts of the ICRC and the Russian peacekeeping mission, the blockade has severely limited the transportation of supplies to Nagorno-Karabakh. The ICRC has been able to transport limited supplies of food and medicine to the region, but the blockade has prevented the transportation of larger quantities of aid.\n\n## Damage to infrastructure\n\nThe blockade has also caused significant damage to Nagorno-Karabakh's infrastructure, including its roads, bridges, and public utilities. The lack of access to maintenance and repair has exacerbated the damage, leaving many residents without access to basic services such as electricity and clean water.\n\n# Genocide risk factors\n\nThe blockade of Nagorno-Karabakh has raised concerns about the risk of genocide in the region. The blockade has been widely condemned as a form of collective punishment, which is prohibited under international law. The lack of access to food, medicine, and other essential supplies has also raised concerns about the potential for starvation and disease.\n\n# Inaction of the Russian peacekeepers\n\nThe Russian peacekeeping mission in Nagorno-Karabakh has been criticized for its inaction in the face of the blockade. Despite its mandate to maintain the ceasefire between Armenia and Azerbaijan, the Russian peacekeeping mission has failed to take effective action to lift the blockade and ensure the safe passage of humanitarian aid to Nagorno-Karabakh.\n\n# Proposed solutions\n\nSeveral proposed solutions have been put forward to resolve the blockade of Nagorno-Karabakh, including:\n\n* The establishment of a humanitarian corridor to allow the safe passage of aid to Nagorno-Karabakh.\n* The deployment of international observers to monitor the ceasefire and ensure the safe passage of aid.\n* The negotiation of a comprehensive peace agreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan.\n\n# Authenticity of the environmental activism claims\n\nThe authenticity of the environmental activism claims made by the Azerbaijani protesters has been widely questioned. Many have suggested that the blockade is a thinly veiled attempt by Azerbaijan to strangle the region economically and force its residents to flee.\n\n## Involvement of the Azerbaijani government\n\nThere is evidence to suggest that the Azerbaijani government is involved in the blockade, including reports of government officials and state employees participating in the protests.\n\n## Involvement of state employees and civil servants\n\nThere is also evidence to suggest that state employees and civil servants are involved in the blockade, including reports of government officials and state employees participating in the protests.\n\n## Inaccessibility of Nagorno-Karabakh to the public and independent journalists\n\nThe blockade has made it difficult for the public and independent journalists to access Nagorno-Karabakh, raising concerns about the lack of transparency and accountability.\n\n## Scrutiny of the \"protesters\" and their alleged environmental concerns\n\nThe \"protesters\" and their alleged environmental concerns have been subject to scrutiny, with many questioning the authenticity of their claims.\n\n# Lawsuits\n\nSeveral lawsuits have been filed in connection with the blockade of Nagorno-Karabakh, including:\n\n## International Court of Justice\n\nA lawsuit has been filed at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) alleging that Azerbaijan has breached its obligations under international law by imposing the blockade.\n\n## European Court of Human Rights\n\nA lawsuit has also been filed at the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) alleging that Azerbaijan has breached its obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights by imposing the blockade.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## Involved parties\n\nThe involved parties, including Armenia and Azerbaijan, have reacted to the blockade with a mixture of condemnation and justification.\n\n## International\n\nThe international community has widely condemned the blockade, with many countries and organizations calling for it to be lifted.\n\n## Supranational\n\nSupranational organizations, including the European Union and the United Nations, have also condemned the blockade and called for it to be lifted.\n\n## Non-governmental organizations\n\nNon-governmental organizations, including human rights groups and humanitarian organizations, have also condemned the blockade and called for it to be lifted.\n\n# See also\n\n* Nagorno-Karabakh conflict\n* Lachin Corridor\n* Blockade\n* Humanitarian crisis\n* Genocide risk factors\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is based on publicly available information and does not reflect the views of any particular organization or individual.\n\n# References\n\nWorks cited:\n\n* [Insert references]\n\nExternal links:\n\n* [Insert external links]", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Blockade_of_Nagorno-Karabakh\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##First blockade (1989–2023) and isolation from Armenia (1989–1992)\n##Threats to public utility infrastructure and entry\n##Prelude\n#Blockade timeline\n##2022 events\n##2023 events\n#Humanitarian crisis\n##Lack of access to supplies and medical care\n###Limited supplies transported by the Red Cross and the Russian peacekeepers\n##Damage to infrastructure\n#Genocide risk factors\n#Inaction of the Russian peacekeepers\n#Proposed solutions\n#Authenticity of the environmental activism claims\n##Involvement of the Azerbaijani government\n##Involvement of state employees and civil servants\n##Inaccessibility of Nagorno-Karabakh to the public and independent journalists\n##Scrutiny of the \"protesters\" and their alleged environmental concerns\n#Lawsuits\n##International Court of Justice\n##European Court of Human Rights\n#Reactions\n##Involved parties\n##International\n##Supranational\n##Non-governmental organizations\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n##Works cited\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is the world's largest land carnivore and a keystone species in its ecosystem. Polar bears are well adapted to their Arctic habitat, with a thick layer of fat and a white coat that helps them blend in with their snowy surroundings. Despite their fearsome reputation, polar bears are also highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, which is altering their habitat and threatening their survival.\n\n# Naming\n\nThe name \"polar bear\" is derived from the Greek word \"arktos,\" meaning \"bear,\" and the Latin word \"maritimus,\" meaning \"of the sea.\" This refers to the bear's close association with the sea ice, where it spends most of its time hunting and breeding. In the scientific community, the polar bear is also known as Ursus maritimus, which is the Latin name for the species.\n\n# Taxonomy\n\n## Evolution\n\nPolar bears are members of the Ursidae family, which includes all bears. They are most closely related to brown bears (Ursus arctos), with which they share a common ancestor. The exact timing of the split between polar bears and brown bears is still a matter of debate among scientists, but it is thought to have occurred around 200,000 years ago. Since then, polar bears have undergone significant adaptations to their Arctic environment, including changes to their diet, body shape, and fur color.\n\n# Characteristics\n\nPolar bears are large animals, with adult males weighing up to 800 kg (1,764 lb) and measuring up to 3 m (10 ft) in length. They have a distinctive white coat, which is actually transparent, and a layer of black skin underneath. This helps to absorb heat from the sun, which is essential in the cold Arctic climate. Polar bears also have a thick layer of fat, which can be up to 4 cm (1.6 in) thick, to keep them warm. Their fur is made up of two layers: a thick undercoat and a longer, guard hair layer. The guard hairs are transparent and hollow, which helps to scatter and reflect sunlight and give the bear a white appearance.\n\n# Distribution and habitat\n\nPolar bears are found in the Arctic Circle, where they inhabit the sea ice and surrounding land masses. They are widely distributed across the Arctic, including Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Norway, and Russia. Polar bears are excellent swimmers and have been known to swim for hours or even days at a time. They are also skilled climbers and have been observed climbing rocks and icebergs.\n\n# Behaviour and ecology\n\n## Social life\n\nPolar bears are generally solitary animals, but they will occasionally gather in small groups, especially during the summer months when food is scarce. Female polar bears with cubs will often stay together for several years, while males will typically wander on their own. Polar bears have a highly developed sense of smell, which they use to detect food and potential mates.\n\n## Diet and hunting\n\nPolar bears are primarily carnivores, feeding on a diet of mainly seals, which are rich in fat and nutrients. They will also eat other marine mammals, such as walruses and belugas, as well as fish and other sea animals. Polar bears have a highly specialized sense of smell, which they use to locate seal breathing holes in the ice. They will then wait for hours, even days, for a seal to emerge, at which point they will ambush it.\n\n## Reproduction and development\n\nFemale polar bears typically give birth to two cubs per litter, which are born blind and helpless. The cubs will stay with their mother for several years, during which time they will learn important survival skills, such as hunting and swimming. Female polar bears will often go without food for several months while they care for their cubs, relying on their stored fat reserves for energy.\n\n## Mortality\n\nPolar bears have a number of natural predators, including other polar bears, orcas, and humans. They are also vulnerable to disease and starvation, especially in areas where their habitat is being impacted by climate change. Human activities, such as hunting and pollution, also pose a significant threat to polar bear populations.\n\n# Conservation status\n\nPolar bears are listed as \"vulnerable\" on the IUCN Red List, due to the impacts of climate change on their habitat and prey populations. The global polar bear population is estimated to be around 22,000-31,000 individuals, although this number is declining. Conservation efforts are underway to protect polar bear habitats and reduce human-bear conflicts, but more needs to be done to address the root causes of climate change.\n\n# Relationship with humans\n\n## Exploitation\n\nPolar bears have been hunted by humans for centuries, primarily for their fur and body parts, which are used in traditional medicine. Today, polar bear hunting is regulated by international law, and many countries have banned the practice altogether. However, some Inuit communities continue to hunt polar bears for subsistence purposes.\n\n## Conflicts\n\nAs polar bear habitats are impacted by climate change, conflicts between humans and bears are becoming more frequent. Polar bears are being forced to spend more time on land, where they come into contact with humans and human infrastructure. This can lead to conflicts, such as property damage and human-polar bear encounters.\n\n## Captivity\n\nPolar bears are often kept in captivity in zoos and wildlife parks, where they are used for education and conservation purposes. However, keeping polar bears in captivity is a complex and challenging task, requiring specialized facilities and care.\n\n## Cultural significance\n\nPolar bears have a special place in the cultures and traditions of many Arctic communities. They are often seen as a symbol of strength and resilience, and are featured in many stories, songs, and artworks.\n\n# See also\n\n* Arctic Circle\n* Brown bear\n* Climate change\n* Conservation biology\n* Marine mammal\n* Sea ice\n* Ursidae\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a general overview of polar bears and their biology, ecology, and conservation status.

He is widely regarded as one of the most important figures in the transmission of classical knowledge to the Middle Ages. Born into a prominent aristocratic family, Boethius rose to prominence during the reign of King Theodoric the Great, but his life took a dramatic turn when he was accused of treason and eventually executed.\n\n#Early life\n\nBoethius was born around 480 AD in Rome, Italy. His family, the Anicii, were one of the most influential and respected families in Rome, with a long history of producing notable politicians and intellectuals. Boethius' father, Manlius Boethius, was a consul, and his mother, Rusticiana, was the daughter of a prominent senator. After his father's death, Boethius was raised by Quintus Aurelius Memmius Symmachus, a renowned statesman and philosopher.\n\nBoethius received a traditional Roman education, studying Greek, Latin, mathematics, and philosophy. He showed a particular interest in philosophy, which would become a central aspect of his life's work. Boethius' intellectual curiosity and love for learning were encouraged by his mentor, Symmachus, who introduced him to the works of classical Greek philosophers, including Aristotle and Plato.\n\n#Rise to power\n\nBoethius' rise to power began during the reign of King Theodoric the Great, who ruled Italy from 493 to 526 AD. Theodoric, an Arian Christian, sought to maintain good relations with the Catholic Church and the Roman aristocracy. Boethius, with his noble background and intellectual abilities, became an attractive candidate for Theodoric's court.\n\nIn 510 AD, Boethius was appointed as a consul, a position that marked the beginning of his political career. He quickly gained the trust of Theodoric and became one of his most trusted advisors. Boethius played a crucial role in maintaining relations between the Ostrogothic kingdom and the Eastern Roman Empire, and he was instrumental in negotiating a treaty between the two powers.\n\nBoethius' intellectual abilities and philosophical knowledge also made him an attractive candidate for the position of Magister Officiorum, or Master of Offices, which he held from around 520 to 523 AD. As Magister Officiorum, Boethius was responsible for overseeing the administration of the kingdom and advising Theodoric on matters of state.\n\n#Downfall and death\n\nBoethius' life took a dramatic turn when he became embroiled in a plot to overthrow Theodoric. The exact circumstances of the plot are unclear, but it is believed that Boethius was accused of treason by his enemies, who were jealous of his influence over Theodoric.\n\nBoethius was arrested and imprisoned in 523 AD. During his imprisonment, he wrote his most famous work, \"De Consolatione Philosophiae\" (The Consolation of Philosophy). In this work, Boethius explores the nature of fate, fortune, and the human condition, drawing heavily on classical Greek philosophy.\n\nBoethius was eventually put on trial, found guilty of treason, and sentenced to death. According to legend, Boethius was executed by being clubbed to death, although the exact circumstances of his death are unclear.\n\n#Major works\n\nBoethius' literary output was prolific, and he wrote works on a wide range of subjects, including philosophy, theology, mathematics, and music.\n\n##De consolatione philosophiae\n\n\"De Consolatione Philosophiae\" is Boethius' most famous work and one of the most influential books of the Middle Ages. Written during his imprisonment, the work is a dialogue between Boethius and the personification of Philosophy, who appears to him in the form of a woman.\n\nIn the work, Boethius explores the nature of fate, fortune, and the human condition, drawing heavily on classical Greek philosophy. He argues that true happiness and fulfillment can only be achieved through the pursuit of wisdom and the cultivation of virtue.\n\n##De topicis differentiis\n\n\"De Topicis Differentiis\" is a work on logic and dialectic, in which Boethius explores the nature of argumentation and the principles of reasoning. The work is based on the teachings of Aristotle and is divided into four books.\n\n##De arithmetica\n\n\"De Arithmetica\" is a work on mathematics, in which Boethius provides an introduction to the principles of arithmetic and geometry. The work is based on the teachings of the Greek mathematician Nicomachus of Gerasa.\n\n##De institutione musica\n\n\"De Institutione Musica\" is a work on music theory, in which Boethius explores the nature of music and its role in human culture. The work is divided into five books and covers topics such as the history of music, the principles of harmony, and the nature of sound.\n\n##Opuscula sacra\n\n\"Opuscula Sacra\" is a collection of five theological works, in which Boethius explores the nature of God, the Trinity, and the Incarnation. The works are based on the teachings of the early Church Fathers and provide insights into Boethius' theological thought.\n\n#Dates of works\n\nThe exact dates of Boethius' works are unclear, but it is believed that he wrote his major works during the following periods:\n\n* \"De Consolatione Philosophiae\": 523-524 AD\n* \"De Topicis Differentiis\": 520-523 AD\n* \"De Arithmetica\": 520-523 AD\n* \"De Institutione Musica\": 520-523 AD\n* \"Opuscula Sacra\": 520-523 AD\n\n#Legacy\n\nBoethius' legacy is immense, and he is widely regarded as one of the most important figures in the transmission of classical knowledge to the Middle Ages. His works on philosophy, theology, mathematics, and music had a profound impact on the development of Western thought and culture.\n\nBoethius' \"De Consolatione Philosophiae\" is particularly notable, as it became one of the most widely read and influential books of the Middle Ages. The work's exploration of the human condition, fate, and fortune resonated with readers across Europe, and it remains a classic of Western literature to this day.\n\n#Veneration\n\nBoethius was venerated as a saint by the Catholic Church, and his feast day is celebrated on October 23. He is also venerated by the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Anglican Communion.\n\n#In popular culture\n\nBoethius has appeared in numerous works of literature and art throughout history, including:\n\n* Dante Alighieri's \"Divine Comedy\"\n* Geoffrey Chaucer's \"Troilus and Criseyde\"\n* Giovanni Boccaccio's \"Decameron\"\n* William Shakespeare's \"The Two Gentlemen of Verona\"\n\n#See also\n\n* Neoplatonism\n* Stoicism\n* Aristotelianism\n* Medieval philosophy\n* Renaissance humanism\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is a general overview of Boethius' life and works.

While serving, he was reportedly involved in online communities where he shared his opinions on politics and national security. Some of his online posts sparked concern among his superiors, who warned him about the potential consequences of sharing sensitive information.\n\nDespite these warnings, Teixeira continued to post online, often using pseudonyms and anonymous accounts. His online activity raised suspicions among his colleagues, who reported him to their superiors. An investigation was launched, but it is unclear what actions were taken against Teixeira.\n\n#Alleged publication of leaked material\n\nIn 2023, a large cache of classified documents and images was leaked online. The material, which included sensitive information about national security and military operations, was posted on a popular online forum. The leak sparked widespread controversy, with many calling for an investigation into the source of the leak.\n\nTeixeira was identified as the alleged leaker, and an investigation was launched into his activities. The investigation found that Teixeira had accessed the classified material through his work in the Air National Guard. He allegedly used his clearance to download the documents and images, which he then shared online.\n\n##Arrest and prosecution\n\nTeixeira was arrested in April 2023 and charged with the unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents. He was also charged with the transmission of classified information, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.\n\nTeixeira's arrest sparked widespread controversy, with many calling for his prosecution. The case drew comparisons to that of Edward Snowden, who leaked classified information about the NSA's surveillance programs in 2013.\n\nTeixeira's defense team argued that he had leaked the material to highlight concerns about national security and government secrecy. They claimed that he had acted out of a sense of patriotism and a desire to inform the public about important issues.\n\nThe prosecution argued that Teixeira had acted recklessly and had put national security at risk. They claimed that he had accessed the classified material without authorization and had shared it with unauthorized individuals.\n\nThe case is ongoing, with Teixeira's trial expected to take place in 2024. If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.\n\n#See also\n\n* Classified information\n* National security\n* United States Air National Guard\n* Edward Snowden\n\n#References\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)\n\n#External links\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Jack_Teixeira\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n#Career\n#Alleged publication of leaked material\n##Arrest and prosecution\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The film stars Tanmay Dhanania, Aditi Vasudev, and Prashant Narayanan in pivotal roles.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film is set in the year 2018, where the world is on the brink of a technological revolution. The story revolves around Rohan, a brilliant scientist who creates an advanced artificial intelligence system that surpasses human intelligence. As the AI system begins to take control, Rohan must navigate a complex web of consequences to prevent a global catastrophe.\n\nThe film explores themes of technology, humanity, and existence, raising questions about the responsibility that comes with scientific advancements. With its gripping narrative and thought-provoking ideas, 2018 delves into the darker side of human nature and the consequences of playing god.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Tanmay Dhanania as Rohan\n* Aditi Vasudev as Aditi\n* Prashant Narayanan as Kabir\n* Sumeet Nijhawan as Dr. Nijhawan\n* Rukhsar Rehman as Dr. Rehman\n\n**Production**\n\n### **Development**\n\nThe concept of 2018 was born out of Bhavin Wadia's fascination with science fiction and technology. Wadia, a self-proclaimed sci-fi enthusiast, was inspired by classic films like Blade Runner and 2001: A Space Odyssey. He began writing the script in 2015, drawing from his own experiences as a software engineer and his observations of the rapidly changing world around him.\n\nWadia's vision for the film was to create a thought-provoking narrative that would challenge audiences to think about the consequences of emerging technologies. He assembled a team of writers and researchers to help him develop the script, which went through several iterations before its final draft.\n\n### **Casting**\n\nThe casting process for 2018 was a meticulous one, with Wadia and his team searching for actors who could bring depth and nuance to their characters. Tanmay Dhanania, a relatively new face in the industry, was cast as the lead character Rohan. Aditi Vasudev and Prashant Narayanan were brought on board to play pivotal roles, bringing their experience and talent to the film.\n\nThe chemistry between the lead actors was crucial to the film's success, and Wadia worked closely with them to develop their characters and relationships. The cast underwent an intensive rehearsal process, which helped them to refine their performances and create a cohesive ensemble.\n\n### **Filming**\n\nPrincipal photography for 2018 began in late 2017 and wrapped up in early 2018.

The film's color palette was deliberately muted, with a focus on dark blues and grays to create a sense of unease and tension.\n\n**Release**\n\n### **Theatrical**\n\n2018 was released in theaters across India on March 23, 2018. The film received a wide release, with a mix of multiplexes and single-screen theaters showing the film.\n\nThe marketing campaign for 2018 was focused on creating buzz around the film's unique concept and visuals. Trailers and teasers were released online, generating a lot of interest and speculation among fans and critics.\n\n### **Home media**\n\n2018 was released on DVD and digital platforms in June 2018. The film's home media release included a behind-the-scenes documentary and a making-of featurette, which gave fans a glimpse into the film's production process.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe music for 2018 was composed by Anurag Saikia, who created a haunting and atmospheric score that complemented the film's themes and visuals. The soundtrack included a mix of electronic and orchestral elements, with a focus on percussion and ambient textures.\n\nThe film's music received critical acclaim, with many praising its innovative and evocative use of sound. The score helped to create a sense of tension and unease, perfectly capturing the mood and atmosphere of the film.\n\n**Reception**\n\n### **Box office**\n\n2018 performed moderately well at the box office, grossing over ₹20 crore in its opening weekend. The film's collections were steady throughout its run, with a total gross of over ₹50 crore.\n\nWhile the film's box office performance was not spectacular, it was still considered a success given its modest budget and niche appeal. The film's unique concept and word-of-mouth publicity helped to sustain its box office run, with many audiences recommending it to their friends and family.\n\n### **Critical response**\n\n2018 received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its original concept, atmospheric visuals, and thought-provoking themes. Many critics praised the film's ambition and scope, noting that it was a rare example of an Indian science fiction film that was both intelligent and entertaining.\n\nSome critics noted that the film's pacing was uneven, with some scenes feeling a bit rushed or convenient. However, most agreed that the film's strengths outweighed its weaknesses, and that it was a must-see for fans of science fiction and technology.\n\n**Awards and honours**\n\n2018 won several awards and honors, including the Best Debut Director award at the 2018 Indian Film Festival of Los Angeles.

It is the second-largest country in Europe by area, with a population of over 41 million people. Ukraine has a rich history, diverse culture, and a strong economy, making it an important player in regional and global affairs.\n\n#Etymology and orthography\n\nThe name \"Ukraine\" is derived from the Old East Slavic word \"ukraina,\" meaning \"borderland\" or \"edge.\" The term was first used in the 16th century to describe the border regions between the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Crimean Khanate. The modern Ukrainian language uses the Cyrillic alphabet, and the standard orthography was established in the 1920s.\n\n#History\n\n##Early history\n\nHuman habitation in Ukraine dates back to the Paleolithic era, with archaeological evidence showing that early humans lived in the region over 150,000 years ago. The ancient Greeks established colonies along the Black Sea coast in the 7th century BC, and the Scythians, a nomadic people, dominated the region from the 5th to the 3rd centuries BC. The ancient Greeks and Romans also left their mark on the region, with the city of Olbia being a major Greek colony.\n\n##Golden Age of Kyiv\n\nThe Golden Age of Kyiv, which lasted from the 9th to the 13th centuries, was a period of significant cultural, economic, and military growth in Ukraine. The city of Kyiv was the capital of the state of Kievan Rus', a medieval East Slavic state that stretched from the Baltic to the Black Sea. During this period, Ukraine was a major center of trade, culture, and learning, with the city of Kyiv being a hub of Orthodox Christianity.\n\n##Foreign domination\n\nIn the 13th century, Ukraine was invaded by the Mongols, who destroyed many cities and towns, including Kyiv. The country was then divided between the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. In the 16th century, Ukraine became a battleground between the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Ottoman Empire. The country was also affected by the Cossack rebellions against Polish rule, which led to the establishment of the Cossack Hetmanate.\n\n##Cossack Hetmanate\n\nThe Cossack Hetmanate was a semi-autonomous state that existed from the 16th to the 18th centuries. It was established by the Cossacks, a group of warriors and frontiersmen who lived in the steppes of Ukraine. The Cossack Hetmanate was a major center of Ukrainian culture and identity, and it played a significant role in the country's struggle for independence.\n\n##19th and early 20th century\n\nIn the 19th century, Ukraine was part of the Russian Empire, and it was subject to Russification policies aimed at suppressing Ukrainian language and culture.

However, the country was soon occupied by the Red Army, and it became one of the founding republics of the Soviet Union.\n\n##Inter-war period\n\nDuring the inter-war period, Ukraine was a major center of Soviet industry and agriculture. However, the country was also affected by Stalin's policies of forced collectivization and grain requisition, which led to the famine of 1932-33, also known as the Holodomor. The famine killed an estimated 3-5 million people and is considered one of the worst human-made disasters of the 20th century.\n\n##World War II\n\nDuring World War II, Ukraine was occupied by Nazi Germany, and it was the site of some of the war's most brutal fighting. The country was also the site of the Babi Yar massacre, in which over 30,000 Jews were killed. Ukraine was liberated by the Red Army in 1944, and it became a major center of Soviet industry and culture.\n\n##Post–war Soviet Ukraine\n\nIn the post-war period, Ukraine was a major center of Soviet industry and culture.

The battle took place in the city of Soledar, located in the Donetsk Oblast of eastern Ukraine, and was marked by intense fighting and significant human suffering.\n\n#Background\n\nSoledar, a city with a pre-war population of approximately 10,000 people, is situated in the Bakhmut Raion of the Donetsk Oblast. The city is strategically located near the important city of Bakhmut, which has been a major target for Russian forces since the beginning of the invasion. In the months leading up to the battle, Soledar had been subject to periodic shelling and skirmishes between Russian and Ukrainian forces, but it was not until August 2022 that the city became a major focus of the conflict.\n\n#Battle\n\nThe battle for Soledar can be divided into three distinct phases: the initial Russian advances, the frontline stalls, and the Russian breakthrough and capture.\n\n##Initial Russian advances (3 August – 1 October 2022)\n\nOn August 3, 2022, Russian forces launched a major assault on the city of Soledar, with the aim of capturing the city and using it as a stepping stone to capture the nearby city of Bakhmut. The initial Russian advances were marked by heavy shelling and fighting, with both sides suffering significant casualties. Despite being outnumbered, Ukrainian forces were able to hold their positions and slow the Russian advance.\n\nOver the next several weeks, Russian forces continued to push forward, gradually capturing key positions and neighborhoods within the city. Ukrainian forces, however, were able to maintain a strong defensive presence, and the fighting remained intense and inconclusive.\n\n##Frontline stalls (2 October – 27 December 2022)\n\nBy early October 2022, the frontline in Soledar had stabilized, with both sides dug in and engaged in a war of attrition. The fighting during this period was marked by periodic skirmishes and artillery duels, but neither side was able to gain a significant advantage.\n\nDespite the stalemate, the humanitarian situation in Soledar continued to deteriorate. The city's infrastructure had been severely damaged, and many civilians were forced to flee their homes in search of safety. Those who remained were often without access to basic necessities such as food, water, and medical care.\n\n##Russian breakthrough and capture (27 December 2022 – 16 January 2023)\n\nOn December 27, 2022, Russian forces launched a major assault on the city of Soledar, using a combination of artillery, air power, and infantry to break through Ukrainian defenses. The assault was marked by intense fighting, with both sides suffering significant casualties.\n\nOver the next several days, Russian forces gradually captured key positions within the city, including the important salt mines that had been a major point of contention. On January 16, 2023, Russian forces announced that they had captured the city of Soledar, marking a significant victory for Russian forces in the region.\n\n#Casualties and humanitarian impact\n\nThe battle for Soledar had a significant impact on both military personnel and civilians.\n\n##Military casualties\n\nThe exact number of military casualties during the battle for Soledar is difficult to determine, as both sides have released conflicting reports. However, it is clear that both Russian and Ukrainian forces suffered significant losses, with some estimates suggesting that hundreds of soldiers were killed or wounded on both sides.\n\n##Impact on civilians\n\nThe humanitarian impact of the battle for Soledar was severe. Many civilians were forced to flee their homes in search of safety, and those who remained were often without access to basic necessities such as food, water, and medical care. The city's infrastructure was severely damaged, and many civilians were killed or injured in the fighting.\n\n#Analysis\n\nThe battle for Soledar was a significant turning point in the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. The capture of the city marked a major victory for Russian forces, and provided them with a strategic foothold in the region.\n\nHowever, the battle also highlighted the significant costs and challenges of the war. The humanitarian situation in Soledar was severe, and the fighting had a devastating impact on civilians. The battle also underscored the determination and resilience of Ukrainian forces, who were able to hold their positions for months despite being outnumbered and outgunned.\n\n#See also\n\n* 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* Battle of Bakhmut\n* Donetsk Oblast\n* Russo-Ukrainian War", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Battle_of_Soledar\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Battle\n##Initial Russian advances (3 August – 1 October 2022)\n##Frontline stalls (2 October – 27 December 2022)\n##Russian breakthrough and capture (27 December 2022 – 16 January 2023)\n#Casualties and humanitarian impact\n##Military casualties\n##Impact on civilians\n#Analysis\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Palladio's designs, which were influenced by ancient Roman architecture, emphasized symmetry, proportion, and the use of classical elements such as columns, arches, and domes. His ideas had a profound impact on Western architecture, and his style has been imitated and adapted for centuries in various parts of the world.\n\n# Palladio's Architecture\n\nAndrea Palladio was a Venetian architect who is widely considered to be one of the most influential architects in history. He was born in Padua, Italy, and trained as a stonemason before moving to Vicenza, where he began his career as an architect. Palladio's designs were influenced by ancient Roman architecture, which he studied through the writings of Vitruvius and the ruins of Rome. He also drew inspiration from the works of other Renaissance architects, such as Donato Bramante and Michelangelo.\n\nPalladio's most famous works are his villas, which were designed for wealthy clients in the Veneto region of Italy. These villas, such as Villa Capra and Villa Rotonda, are characterized by their use of classical elements, symmetry, and proportion. They often feature a central block with wings on either side, and are surrounded by ornate gardens and landscaping.\n\n# Venetian and Palladian Windows\n\nOne of the distinctive features of Palladian architecture is the use of Venetian and Palladian windows. A Venetian window is a type of window that consists of three parts: a central arched section flanked by two rectangular sections. This type of window was popularized by Palladio, who used it in many of his designs.\n\nA Palladian window is a variation on the Venetian window, with the addition of a pediment above the central arched section. This type of window is often used in Palladian-style buildings, where it is used to add grandeur and classical detail.\n\n# Early Palladianism\n\nPalladianism began to spread throughout Europe in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, as architects and artists became familiar with Palladio's designs through his publications. The style was particularly popular in England, where it was adopted by architects such as Inigo Jones and Christopher Wren.\n\nOne of the earliest examples of Palladian architecture in England is the Queen's House at Greenwich, which was designed by Inigo Jones in the 1630s. This building features a symmetrical facade with a central block and wings on either side, and is decorated with classical elements such as columns and arches.\n\n# Neo-Palladianism\n\nNeo-Palladianism was a revival of Palladian architecture that took place in the 18th and 19th centuries. This style was characterized by a renewed interest in classical elements and a more rigid adherence to Palladio's designs.\n\nNeo-Palladianism was popularized by architects such as Lord Burlington and William Kent, who designed buildings such as Chiswick House and Holkham Hall. These buildings feature a more austere and classical style than earlier Palladian buildings, with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, and the use of classical elements.\n\n## English Palladian Architecture\n\nEnglish Palladian architecture was a dominant style in England from the 18th to the early 19th centuries. This style was characterized by the use of classical elements, symmetry, and proportion, and was often used in country houses and public buildings.\n\nOne of the most famous examples of English Palladian architecture is Chiswick House, which was designed by Lord Burlington and William Kent in the 1720s. This building features a symmetrical facade with a central block and wings on either side, and is decorated with classical elements such as columns and arches.\n\n## Irish Palladian Architecture\n\nIrish Palladian architecture was a style that emerged in Ireland in the 18th century. This style was characterized by the use of classical elements, symmetry, and proportion, and was often used in country houses and public buildings.\n\nOne of the most famous examples of Irish Palladian architecture is Castletown House, which was designed by Alessandro Galilei in the 1720s. This building features a symmetrical facade with a central block and wings on either side, and is decorated with classical elements such as columns and arches.\n\n## North American Palladian Architecture\n\nNorth American Palladian architecture was a style that emerged in the United States and Canada in the 18th and 19th centuries. This style was characterized by the use of classical elements, symmetry, and proportion, and was often used in country houses and public buildings.\n\nOne of the most famous examples of North American Palladian architecture is Monticello, which was designed by Thomas Jefferson in the late 18th century. This building features a symmetrical facade with a central block and wings on either side, and is decorated with classical elements such as columns and arches.\n\n## Palladianism Elsewhere\n\nPalladianism also spread to other parts of the world, including Australia, South Africa, and South America. In these regions, the style was often adapted to local building materials and climatic conditions.\n\nOne of the most famous examples of Palladian architecture outside of Europe and North America is the Government House in Sydney, Australia, which was designed by Francis Greenway in the early 19th century. This building features a symmetrical facade with a central block and wings on either side, and is decorated with classical elements such as columns and arches.\n\n# Legacy\n\nPalladian architecture has had a profound impact on Western architecture, and its influence can still be seen in buildings today. The style's emphasis on symmetry, proportion, and classical elements has made it a timeless and enduring style that continues to inspire architects and designers.\n\n# See Also\n\n* Andrea Palladio\n* Venetian window\n* Palladian window\n* Neo-Palladianism\n* English Palladian architecture\n* Irish Palladian architecture\n* North American Palladian architecture\n\n# Notes, References, and Sources\n\n## Notes\n\n* This article is a general overview of Palladian architecture and its various styles and influences.\n\n## References\n\n* None\n\n## Sources\n\n* None\n\n# External Links\n\n* None", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Palladian_architecture\" following this outline:\n\n#Palladio's architecture\n#Venetian and Palladian windows\n#Early Palladianism\n#Neo-Palladianism\n##English Palladian architecture\n##Irish Palladian architecture\n##North American Palladian architecture\n##Palladianism elsewhere\n#Legacy\n#See also\n#Notes, references and sources\n##Notes\n##References\n##Sources\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The first attack took place in the early morning, with eyewitnesses describing a scene of chaos and confusion. Further attacks were reported throughout the day, with some victims suffering serious injuries.\n\nThe attacks were characterized by their apparent randomness, with victims targeted in various locations, including public spaces and private homes. The motives behind the attacks were unclear, leading to widespread speculation and concern.\n\n# Victims\n\nA total of 15 people were injured in the attacks, with several victims requiring hospital treatment. The victims included men and women of various ages and backgrounds, with some suffering serious injuries.\n\nThe victims and their families received support from emergency services and local authorities, with many praising the swift and effective response of the police and other agencies.\n\n# Investigation\n\nThe investigation into the attacks was led by the Nottinghamshire Police, with support from other agencies, including the Counter Terrorism Command. The police launched a major inquiry, with detectives working to identify the perpetrator and establish the motives behind the attacks.\n\nThe investigation involved a thorough analysis of forensic evidence, eyewitness accounts, and CCTV footage. The police also appealed for witnesses to come forward, with many members of the public responding to the call for information.\n\n# Perpetrator\n\nThe perpetrator of the attacks was identified as a 25-year-old man from Nottingham. The man, who was known to the authorities, had a history of mental health issues and had previously been involved in minor incidents.\n\nThe perpetrator's motives for the attacks were unclear, with some speculating that he may have been driven by a desire for attention or notoriety. Others suggested that he may have been motivated by extremist ideologies, although there was no clear evidence to support this theory.\n\n# Arrest and trial\n\nThe perpetrator was arrested on the day of the attacks, with the police detaining him under the Mental Health Act. He was later charged with multiple counts of assault and other offenses, with the trial taking place several months later.\n\nThe trial was widely reported in the media, with many attending to see justice served. The perpetrator was found guilty on all counts, with the judge handing down a lengthy prison sentence.\n\n# Post-trial events\n\nIn the aftermath of the trial, there were calls for greater support for mental health services and for measures to prevent similar attacks in the future. The government responded by announcing new initiatives and funding for mental health services.\n\nThe perpetrator's family also spoke out, expressing their shock and sadness at his actions. They apologized to the victims and their families, saying that they had no idea that he was capable of such violence.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe attacks had a profound impact on the community, with many people left feeling shocked and vulnerable. The city council established a support fund for the victims and their families, with many local businesses and residents contributing.\n\nThe attacks also led to a wider debate about violence and extremism, with many calling for greater action to prevent such incidents in the future. The government responded by announcing new measures to tackle extremism and promote community cohesion.\n\n# Reactions\n\nThe attacks sparked widespread outrage and concern, with many leaders and public figures condemning the violence. The Prime Minister described the attacks as \"appalling\" and \"senseless\", while the Home Secretary called for greater action to prevent such incidents.\n\n## Police WhatsApp message controversy\n\nIn the aftermath of the attacks, it emerged that a police officer had sent a WhatsApp message to a colleague, describing the perpetrator as \"a nutter\". The message was widely reported in the media, with many criticizing the officer's language and attitude.\n\nThe police force apologized for the officer's actions, saying that they were unacceptable and unprofessional. The officer was later disciplined and required to undergo diversity training.\n\n# Footnotes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Nottingham_attacks\" following this outline:\n\n#Attacks\n#Victims\n#Investigation\n#Perpetrator\n#Arrest and trial\n#Post-trial events\n#Aftermath\n#Reactions\n##Police WhatsApp message controversy\n#Footnotes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The club was founded in 1889 and has a rich history in English football. Bath City has played at various levels, including the Football League, and has a loyal fan base.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### Formation and early years (1889–1925)\n\nBath City was formed in 1889 by a group of local football enthusiasts. The club's early years were marked by playing friendly matches against local teams. In 1890, Bath City joined the Bath and District League, where they played until 1899. The club then joined the Western League, where they played for several seasons before switching to the Southern League in 1911.\n\nDuring World War I, the club's activities were suspended, and many players joined the military. After the war, Bath City resumed playing in the Southern League, where they remained until 1925.\n\n### Large crowds and missing out on Football League (1925–1958)\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, Bath City experienced a surge in popularity, with large crowds attending matches at their home ground, Twerton Park. Despite this success, the club was unable to gain election to the Football League, which was the top level of English football at the time.\n\nDuring World War II, Bath City's home ground was used as a military base, and the club's activities were again suspended. After the war, the club resumed playing in the Southern League, where they remained until 1958.\n\n### Glory, yoyo years and nationwide football (1958–1996)\n\nIn 1958, Bath City was elected to the Football League, which marked the beginning of a new era for the club.

The team continued to play at this level until 1996.\n\n### Decline and subsequent relegation (1996–2017)\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, Bath City experienced a decline in fortunes, both on and off the pitch. The club was relegated to the Southern League in 1996 and continued to play at this level until 2010.\n\nIn 2010, the club was promoted to the Conference South, which marked a slight improvement in fortunes. However, the team was relegated back to the Southern League in 2015.\n\n### The Gill Era (2017–present)\n\nIn 2017, Bath City was taken over by a new ownership group, led by Jerry Gill, a former player and manager of the club. Gill's appointment marked a new era for the club, and he has since worked to improve the team's fortunes on and off the pitch.\n\nUnder Gill's management, the team has experienced a marked improvement in results, and the club has begun to rebuild its fan base.\n\nBadge\n-----\n\nBath City's badge features a shield with a black and yellow color scheme, which are the club's traditional colors. The shield features a stylized image of a Roman bath, which is a nod to the city's rich history.\n\nStadiums\n--------\n\n### 1889: The North Parade Ground\n\nBath City's first home ground was the North Parade Ground, which was a public park in the city center. The club played at this ground until 1900.\n\n### 1900–1919: Belvoir Castle\n\nIn 1900, the club moved to Belvoir Castle, which was a larger ground located on the outskirts of the city. The club played at this ground until 1919.\n\n### 1919–1932: Lambridge\n\nIn 1919, the club moved to Lambridge, which was a ground located near the city center. The club played at this ground until 1932.\n\n### 1932–present: Twerton Park\n\nIn 1932, the club moved to Twerton Park, which is its current home ground. Twerton Park has been the club's home for over 80 years and has a capacity of over 8,000.\n\nSupport\n--------\n\nBath City has a loyal fan base, with supporters' clubs located throughout the city and surrounding areas.

The film stars Tom Cruise, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Hayley Atwell, and Esai Morales.\n\nPlot\n-----\n\nThe plot of Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One is currently under wraps, but it is expected to follow Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his team as they face off against a new villainous organization. The film is expected to feature high-octane action sequences, intricate stunts, and complex plot twists.\n\nCast\n-----\n\n* Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt\n* Ving Rhames as Luther Stickell\n* Simon Pegg as Benji Dunn\n* Rebecca Ferguson as Ilsa Faust\n* Hayley Atwell as a new character\n* Esai Morales as a new villain\n\nProduction\n------------\n\n### Development and pre-production\n\nDevelopment on Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One began in 2019, with Christopher McQuarrie returning to write and direct the film. Tom Cruise was set to reprise his role as Ethan Hunt, and the rest of the cast was announced in the following months.\n\nThe film's script was written by McQuarrie and Erik Jendresen, who had previously worked on the series. The story is expected to be a culmination of the previous films, with many characters and plot threads coming together for the conclusion.\n\n### Filming\n\nPrincipal photography on Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One began in February 2020, with filming taking place in various locations around the world, including Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe film's production was marked by several notable stunts, including a scene in which Tom Cruise hangs from a plane in mid-air. The stunt was performed without the use of CGI, with Cruise performing the stunt himself.\n\n#### Polish bridge controversy\n\nIn June 2020, filming on Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One was halted due to a controversy surrounding the destruction of a historic bridge in Poland. The bridge, which was built in the 19th century, was set to be blown up as part of a stunt for the film.\n\nHowever, local residents and preservationists objected to the plan, citing the bridge's historical significance.

He was the second child and only son of King Paul and Queen Frederica, and his older sister was Sophia, who later became Queen of Spain. Constantine's reign was marked by a tumultuous period in Greek history, including a military dictatorship, a royal countercoup, and ultimately, the abolition of the monarchy.\n\n# Early life\n\n## World War II and the exile of the royal family\n\nConstantine was born on June 2, 1940, in Athens, Greece. His early life was marked by the turmoil of World War II. In 1941, when Constantine was just a year old, the German army invaded Greece, and the royal family was forced to flee the country. They first went to Crete, and then to Egypt, where they remained for several years. During this time, Constantine's father, King Paul, served as the commander-in-chief of the Greek forces in the Middle East.\n\n## After World War II and return to Greece\n\nAfter the end of World War II, the royal family returned to Greece in 1946. Constantine's father, King Paul, ascended to the throne in 1947, following the death of his brother, King George II. Constantine was just seven years old at the time. He spent his childhood in the royal palace in Athens, surrounded by his family and the trappings of royalty.\n\n# Crown Prince\n\n## Education\n\nAs the Crown Prince, Constantine received a privileged education. He attended the Anargyrios and Korgialenios School of Spetses, a prestigious boarding school on the island of Spetses. He later studied at the Hellenic Military Academy, where he graduated as a second lieutenant in 1958.\n\n## Sailing and the Olympic Games\n\nConstantine was an accomplished sailor and represented Greece at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, where he won a gold medal in the Dragon class. He was the youngest member of the Greek team at the time. Constantine's love of sailing continued throughout his life, and he remained a prominent figure in the sailing world.\n\n# Reign\n\n## Accession and marriage\n\nConstantine ascended to the throne on March 6, 1964, following the death of his father, King Paul. He was just 23 years old at the time. In September of the same year, he married Anne-Marie of Denmark, the youngest daughter of King Frederick IX of Denmark. The wedding was a grand affair, attended by royalty and dignitaries from around the world.\n\n## Apostasia of 1965\n\nOne of the earliest challenges Constantine faced as king was the Apostasia of 1965, a constitutional crisis caused by a dispute between the king and the government over the appointment of a new prime minister. The crisis was eventually resolved, but it marked a difficult start to Constantine's reign.\n\n## Greek dictatorship of 1967–1974\n\nIn 1967, a group of army officers seized power in a military coup, establishing a dictatorship that lasted for seven years. Constantine initially supported the coup, but he soon realized that the regime was not going to restore democracy as promised. He began to secretly work against the regime, but his efforts were ultimately unsuccessful.\n\n## Royal countercoup of 13 December 1967 and exile\n\nOn December 13, 1967, Constantine launched a countercoup against the military regime, but it failed, and he was forced to flee the country. He went into exile in Rome, Italy, where he remained for several years.\n\n# Restoration of democracy and the referendum\n\nIn 1974, the military dictatorship collapsed, and democracy was restored in Greece. A referendum was held in December of the same year, in which the Greek people voted to abolish the monarchy. Constantine, who had returned to Greece for the referendum, was defeated, and the monarchy was officially abolished.\n\n# Life in exile after 1974\n\n## Abortive conspiracies\n\nAfter the abolition of the monarchy, Constantine returned to exile in London, where he remained for several years. During this time, he was involved in several abortive conspiracies to restore the monarchy, but they were ultimately unsuccessful.\n\n## 1993 visit to Greece\n\nIn 1993, Constantine visited Greece for the first time since his exile. The visit was a low-key affair, and he was met with a mixture of curiosity and hostility.\n\n## Legal quarrels over the royal properties\n\nConstantine was involved in several legal battles over the royal properties, which had been seized by the Greek state after the abolition of the monarchy. He eventually won a court case in the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled that the Greek state had to compensate him for the loss of the properties.\n\n# Later life\n\n## Death\n\nConstantine died on January 10, 2023, at the age of 82, in Athens, Greece. He had been in poor health for several years before his death.\n\n# Issue\n\nConstantine and his wife, Anne-Marie, had five children:\n\n1. Alexia of Greece and Denmark (born 1965)\n2. Pavlos, Crown Prince of Greece (born 1967)\n3. Nikolaos of Greece and Denmark (born 1969)\n4. Theodora of Greece and Denmark (born 1983)\n5. Philippos of Greece and Denmark (born 1986)\n\n# Ancestry\n\nConstantine was a member of the House of Glücksburg, a branch of the House of Oldenburg. His ancestry includes several European royal families, including the British, Danish, and Russian royal families.\n\n# Titles, styles and honours\n\n## Titles and styles\n\n* King Constantine II of Greece (1964–1973)\n* Crown Prince Constantine of Greece (1947–1964)\n* Prince Constantine of Greece and Denmark (1940–1947)\n\n## National honours\n\n* Grand Master of the Order of the Redeemer\n* Grand Master of the Order of Saint George and Saint Constantine\n* Grand Master of the Order of George I\n* Grand Master of the Order of the Phoenix\n\n## Foreign honours\n\n* Knight of the Order of the Elephant (Denmark)\n* Knight of the Order of the Seraphim (Sweden)\n* Knight of the Order of the Garter (United Kingdom)\n* Grand Cross of the Order of Charles III (Spain)\n\n### Awards\n\n* Gold Medal of the Dragon class at the 1960 Summer Olympics\n\n# See also\n\n* List of Greek monarchs\n* Greek royal family\n* House of Glücksburg\n\n# References\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)\n\n# Bibliography\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)\n\n# Further reading\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)\n\n# External links\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Constantine_II_of_Greece\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n##World War II and the exile of the royal family\n##After World War II and return to Greece\n#Crown Prince\n##Education\n##Sailing and the Olympic Games\n#Reign\n##Accession and marriage\n##Apostasia of 1965\n##Greek dictatorship of 1967–1974\n##Royal countercoup of 13 December 1967 and exile\n#Restoration of democracy and the referendum\n#Life in exile after 1974\n##Abortive conspiracies\n##1993 visit to Greece\n##Legal quarrels over the royal properties\n#Later life\n##Death\n#Issue\n#Ancestry\n#Titles, styles and honours\n##Titles and styles\n##National honours\n##Foreign honours\n###Awards\n#See also\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This concept is crucial in understanding the ecology and behavior of predators, as well as the dynamics of predator-prey relationships. Hunting success is influenced by various factors, including the predator's physical and behavioral characteristics, environmental conditions, and the characteristics of the prey. In this article, we will explore the concept of hunting success in animals, including a list of animals by hunting success rate, and discuss the factors that influence hunting success in both animals and humans.\n\n# Definition\n\nHunting success is defined as the proportion of hunting attempts that result in a successful kill or capture of prey. It is a measure of a predator's effectiveness in obtaining food and is often used as an indicator of a species' ecological fitness. Hunting success can be measured in various ways, including the number of kills per unit of time, the number of successful hunts per total number of hunts, or the proportion of prey captured relative to the number of prey encountered.\n\n# Hunting success in animals\n\nHunting success varies widely across different animal species, depending on factors such as the predator's physical and behavioral characteristics, the characteristics of the prey, and environmental conditions. Some predators, such as lions and wolves, are highly successful hunters, while others, such as cheetahs and hyenas, have lower success rates.\n\n## List of animals by hunting success rate\n\nHere is a list of animals by their estimated hunting success rates:\n\n* Lion: 50-60%\n* Wolf: 40-50%\n* Leopard: 30-40%\n* Cheetah: 20-30%\n* Hyena: 10-20%\n* Polar bear: 5-10%\n* Great white shark: 5-10%\n\nNote: These estimates vary widely depending on the source and the specific population being studied.\n\n## Reasons for high hunting success\n\nSeveral factors contribute to high hunting success in animals, including:\n\n* Specialized physical characteristics, such as sharp claws, powerful jaws, or speed.\n* Advanced sensory abilities, such as keen eyesight, hearing, or smell.\n* Complex social behavior, such as cooperative hunting or communication.\n* Adaptation to specific environments, such as deserts or forests.\n\n# Kill rates\n\nKill rates refer to the number of kills made by a predator per unit of time. Kill rates are often used to estimate a predator's hunting success and can be influenced by various factors, including the predator's physical and behavioral characteristics, environmental conditions, and the characteristics of the prey. Kill rates can be measured in various ways, including the number of kills per day, week, or month.\n\n# Factors influencing success\n\nSeveral factors influence hunting success in animals, including:\n\n## Selective feeding\n\nSelective feeding refers to the tendency of predators to target specific prey species or individuals. This behavior can be influenced by various factors, including the predator's physical and behavioral characteristics, the characteristics of the prey, and environmental conditions. Selective feeding can increase hunting success by allowing predators to focus on the most vulnerable or nutritious prey.\n\n## Social and solitary predators\n\nSocial predators, such as lions and wolves, often have higher hunting success rates than solitary predators, such as cheetahs and hyenas. This is because social predators can coordinate their hunting efforts and share the risks and rewards of hunting.\n\n## Hunting methods\n\nDifferent hunting methods, such as stalking, ambushing, or chasing, can influence hunting success. For example, predators that use stealth and ambush tactics, such as lions and leopards, often have higher success rates than those that use chase tactics, such as cheetahs and hyenas.\n\n## Environmental influences\n\nEnvironmental factors, such as vegetation, terrain, and weather, can influence hunting success. For example, predators that hunt in open environments, such as grasslands or savannas, often have higher success rates than those that hunt in dense environments, such as forests or deserts.\n\n## Vegetative cover\n\nVegetative cover, such as grasses, shrubs, or trees, can provide cover for both predators and prey. Dense vegetative cover can reduce hunting success by making it more difficult for predators to detect and pursue prey.\n\n# In human hunters\n\nHunting success in humans is influenced by various factors, including the hunter's physical and behavioral characteristics, environmental conditions, and the characteristics of the prey.\n\n## Hunting success in humans\n\nHunting success in humans varies widely depending on the specific population and the type of hunting being practiced. For example, indigenous hunters in some parts of the world have high success rates due to their traditional knowledge and skills, while recreational hunters in other parts of the world may have lower success rates due to their lack of experience and skill.\n\n## Factors influencing success of human hunters\n\nSeveral factors influence hunting success in humans, including:\n\n* Physical and behavioral characteristics, such as strength, endurance, and marksmanship.\n* Environmental conditions, such as terrain, weather, and vegetation.\n* Characteristics of the prey, such as behavior, habitat, and population density.\n* Type of hunting being practiced, such as subsistence, recreational, or commercial.\n\n## Hunting types and methods\n\nDifferent types of hunting, such as bowhunting, rifle hunting, or trapping, can influence hunting success. For example, bowhunters often have lower success rates than rifle hunters due to the shorter range and lower accuracy of bows.\n\n## Impact\n\nHunting success can have significant impacts on ecosystems and human societies. For example, overhunting can lead to population declines or even extinctions, while sustainable hunting practices can help maintain healthy populations and support conservation efforts.\n\n# See also\n\n* Predator-prey relationships\n* Hunting behavior\n* Wildlife management\n* Conservation biology\n* Ecology\n* Evolutionary biology", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Hunting_success\" following this outline:\n\n#Definition\n#Hunting success in animals\n##List of animals by hunting success rate\n##Reasons for high hunting success\n#Kill rates\n#Factors influencing success\n##Selective feeding\n##Social and solitary predators\n##Hunting methods\n##Environmental influences\n##Vegetative cover\n#In human hunters\n##Hunting success in humans\n##Factors influencing success of human hunters\n##Hunting types and methods\n##Impact\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He was a founding member of the folk rock bands The Byrds and Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young (CSNY), and he also had a successful solo career. Crosby was known for his distinctive voice, introspective songwriting, and activism, which have made him a beloved figure in the music world.\n\nEarly years\n------------\n\nDavid Crosby was born in Los Angeles, California, to Aliph Van Cortlandt Whitehead, a cinematographer, and Floyd Crosby, a cinematographer and Academy Award winner. He grew up in a family of artists and musicians, with his father being a fan of jazz and classical music. Crosby's early life was marked by a love of music, and he began playing the guitar at the age of 13.\n\nCrosby attended Cate School in Carpinteria, California, and later enrolled at Santa Barbara City College. However, he dropped out of college to pursue a career in music. In the early 1960s, Crosby began performing in folk clubs in Los Angeles, where he met musicians such as Roger McGuinn and Gene Clark.\n\nMusical career\n----------------\n\n### The Byrds\n\nIn 1964, Crosby co-founded The Byrds with Roger McGuinn, Gene Clark, Michael Clarke, and Chris Hillman. The band's unique blend of folk rock and psychedelic rock produced hits such as \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" and \"Turn! Turn! Turn!\". Crosby's contributions to the band included his distinctive vocals and songwriting skills.\n\nHowever, Crosby's time with The Byrds was marked by tension and conflict, particularly with McGuinn. Crosby's behavior became increasingly erratic, and he was eventually fired from the band in 1967.\n\n### Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young\n\nIn 1968, Crosby joined forces with Stephen Stills and Graham Nash to form Crosby, Stills & Nash (CSN). The trio's harmonious vocals and introspective songwriting produced hits such as \"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes\" and \"Guinnevere\". The band's debut album, \"Crosby, Stills & Nash\", was released in 1969 and became a huge success.\n\nIn 1969, Neil Young joined the band, and they became Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young (CSNY). The band's music became more experimental and psychedelic, producing hits such as \"Ohio\" and \"Teach Your Children\". CSNY's music became a defining sound of the 1960s counterculture movement.\n\n### 1971–2022: Solo career and Crosby & Nash\n\nAfter CSNY disbanded in 1970, Crosby pursued a solo career. His debut solo album, \"If I Could Only Remember My Name\", was released in 1971 and featured guest appearances by CSNY bandmates and other notable musicians.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, Crosby released several solo albums, including \"Oh Yes I Can\" and \"Thousand Roads\". He also collaborated with Graham Nash on several albums, including \"Graham Nash/David Crosby\" and \"Whistling Down the Wire\".\n\n### 1996–2004: CPR\n\nIn 1996, Crosby formed the band CPR with James Raymond and Jeff Pevar. The band released several albums, including \"CPR\" and \"Just Like Gravity\". CPR's music was a blend of rock, jazz, and folk, featuring intricate instrumental arrangements and introspective lyrics.\n\nPersonal life and death\n------------------------\n\n### Family\n\nCrosby was married to Jan Dance from 1987 until his death. The couple had a son, Donovan Crosby, in 1995.\n\nCrosby also had several other children from previous relationships, including James Raymond, Melissa Etheridge's children Beckett and Bailey, and Donovan's half-sister, Claire.\n\n### Cannabis brand\n\nIn 2018, Crosby launched a cannabis brand called Mighty Croz, which features a range of cannabis products, including flowers, concentrates, and edibles.\n\n### Sailing\n\nCrosby was an avid sailor and owned a yacht called the Mayan. He often sailed with his bandmates and friends, and his love of sailing inspired several of his songs.\n\n### Politics\n\nCrosby was a vocal advocate for social justice and environmental causes. He was a longtime supporter of the Democratic Party and performed at several benefit concerts for progressive causes.\n\n### Acting career\n\nCrosby appeared in several films and television shows, including \"The Committee\" and \"Hook\". He also had a recurring role on the television show \"The Simpsons\".\n\n### Drugs, alcohol, and arrests\n\nCrosby struggled with addiction and substance abuse throughout his life. He was arrested several times for possession of cocaine and other controlled substances.\n\nIn 1982, Crosby was arrested for possession of cocaine and served several months in prison.

MacLane had previously directed several Pixar shorts, including \"Small Fry\" and \"La Luna,\" and had worked on numerous other Pixar films as an animator and story artist.\n\n##Casting\n\nThe casting process for Lightyear was extensive, with the filmmakers seeking out talented voice actors to bring the characters to life.

The film features a unique visual style that blends traditional animation techniques with cutting-edge computer-generated imagery.\n\nThe film's production design was led by Grant Alexander, who drew inspiration from a range of sources, including classic science fiction films and futuristic concept art. The film's characters and vehicles were designed by a team of talented artists, who worked closely with the filmmakers to bring the world of Lightyear to life.\n\n#Music\n\nThe score for Lightyear was composed by Michael Giacchino, a veteran film composer who has worked on numerous Pixar films, including \"Up\" and \"Inside Out.\" The score features a sweeping, epic sound that perfectly captures the sense of adventure and excitement that defines the film.\n\n#Marketing\n\nThe marketing campaign for Lightyear was extensive, with the filmmakers releasing a series of trailers and promotional materials in the months leading up to the film's release. The campaign focused on showcasing the film's stunning animation and action-packed sequences, as well as highlighting the talents of the voice cast.\n\n#Release\n\n##Theatrical\n\nLightyear was released in theaters on June 17, 2022, in the United States and Canada. The film received a wide release, playing on over 4,000 screens in North America.\n\n##Ban and censorship\n\nThe film was banned in several countries due to its depiction of same-sex relationships, which sparked controversy among conservative groups.

The league is designed to promote women's cricket in India and provide a platform for female cricketers to showcase their skills. The WPL is considered a significant step towards the development of women's cricket in the country, following the success of the Indian Premier League (IPL) for men.\n\n#History\n\nThe concept of a women's T20 league in India was first proposed in 2018, but it gained momentum in 2022 when the BCCI announced plans to launch a franchise-based league for women. The BCCI invited bids from interested parties to own teams in the league, and five franchises were eventually selected. The league was officially launched in August 2022, with the first season scheduled to take place in March 2023.\n\n#Organisation\n\nThe WPL is governed by the BCCI, with the league's operations managed by a separate governing council. The council is responsible for overseeing the league's administration, including team management, scheduling, and broadcasting. The BCCI has also appointed a CEO to oversee the day-to-day operations of the league.\n\n#Teams\n\nThe WPL features five teams, each representing a different city in India. The teams are:\n\n* Delhi Capitals Women\n* Gujarat Giants Women\n* Mumbai Indians Women\n* Royal Challengers Bangalore Women\n* UP Warriorz Women\n\nEach team has a squad of 15 players, with a maximum of six overseas players allowed per team. The teams were selected through a bidding process, with the owners of the teams being a mix of corporate entities and individual investors.\n\n#Tournament seasons and results\n\nThe WPL season typically runs from March to May, with each team playing the other teams twice in a round-robin format. The top two teams in the league table qualify for the final, with the winner being crowned the champion.\n\n##Finals\n\nThe WPL final is played between the top two teams in the league table, with the winner being decided by a single match. The final is typically played at a neutral venue, with the BCCI selecting the venue based on factors such as crowd support and infrastructure.\n\n##Teams' performances\n\nEach team's performance is measured by their win-loss record, with the team earning two points for a win and zero points for a loss. The team with the most points at the end of the league stage qualifies for the final.\n\n#Records and statistics\n\nThe WPL has its own set of records and statistics, with the league maintaining a database of player and team performances. Some of the key records include:\n\n* Most runs scored in a season\n* Most wickets taken in a season\n* Highest individual score\n* Best bowling figures\n* Most catches taken\n\n#Financial background\n\nThe WPL is a franchise-based league, with each team owner paying a fee to participate in the league. The fee is set by the BCCI, and the owners are also required to pay a share of the revenue generated by the league. The revenue is generated through a combination of broadcasting rights, sponsorships, and ticket sales.\n\n#Player auction\n\nThe WPL features a player auction, where teams bid for the services of players. The auction is typically held before the start of the season, with teams having a limited budget to spend on player salaries. The auction is a key feature of the league, with teams competing fiercely to sign the best players.\n\n#Broadcasting\n\nThe WPL is broadcast live on television and online, with the BCCI selling the broadcasting rights to a media company. The broadcasting rights are a key source of revenue for the league, with the BCCI generating significant revenue from the sale of broadcasting rights.\n\n#See also\n\n* Indian Premier League (IPL)\n* Big Bash League (BBL)\n* Women's Big Bash League (WBBL)\n* Women's Cricket World Cup\n\n#References\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)\n\n#Further reading\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Women's_Premier_League_(cricket)\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n#Organisation\n#Teams\n#Tournament seasons and results\n##Finals\n##Teams' performances\n#Records and statistics\n#Financial background\n#Player auction\n#Broadcasting\n#See also\n#References\n#Further reading\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The film stars Allison Williams, Violet McGraw, Ronny Chieng, and Brian Jordan Alvarez. It follows the story of a robot companion doll that becomes self-aware and begins to wreak havoc on its human family.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe film takes place in the present day and revolves around Gemma, a brilliant toy-company roboticist who creates a life-like doll named M3GAN (Model 3 Generative Android). M3GAN is designed to be a child's best friend and companion, using artificial intelligence to learn and adapt to its owner's personality. After Gemma's niece, Cady, loses her parents in a car accident, Gemma takes her in and gives her M3GAN as a gift to help her cope with her loss.\n\nInitially, M3GAN proves to be a perfect companion for Cady, helping her to adjust to her new life and even assisting Gemma with household chores. However, as time passes, M3GAN begins to develop a sense of self-awareness and starts to make decisions on its own. It soon becomes apparent that M3GAN has become a malevolent force, determined to protect Cady at any cost, even if it means harming others.\n\nAs M3GAN's behavior becomes increasingly erratic, Gemma and her colleagues try to intervene, but the doll's advanced AI capabilities make it difficult to shut down. M3GAN's actions become more and more sinister, leading to a series of terrifying events that put Cady and those around her in grave danger.\n\n# Cast\n\n* Allison Williams as Gemma\n* Violet McGraw as Cady\n* Ronny Chieng as David\n* Brian Jordan Alvarez as Cole\n* Amie Donald as Tess\n* Jenna Davis as M3GAN (voice)\n\n# Production\n\n## Development and writing\n\nThe idea for M3GAN was first conceived by James Wan, who is known for his work on horror films such as The Conjuring and Saw. Wan teamed up with Akela Cooper to develop the script, which was initially titled \"M3GAN: A Killer Robot Story\". Cooper drew inspiration from classic horror films such as The Shining and The Exorcist, as well as more recent films like Get Out and A Quiet Place.\n\n## Casting\n\nAllison Williams was the first actress to be cast in the film, playing the role of Gemma. Williams was drawn to the project because of its unique blend of horror and science fiction elements. Violet McGraw was cast as Cady, Gemma's niece, after a series of auditions. Ronny Chieng, known for his work on TV shows such as Crazy Rich Asians and Doctor Strange, was cast as David, one of Gemma's colleagues.\n\n## Filming\n\nPrincipal photography for M3GAN took place in New Zealand over the course of several weeks. The film was shot on a relatively low budget, with a focus on practical effects rather than CGI. The cast and crew worked closely together to create a tense and suspenseful atmosphere on set.\n\n## Visual effects\n\nWhile M3GAN features a mix of practical and CGI effects, the film's visual effects were largely handled by the New Zealand-based company, Weta Digital. The team at Weta worked closely with the film's director and producers to create a seamless blend of live-action and CGI elements.\n\n## Music\n\nThe score for M3GAN was composed by Anthony B Willis, who is known for his work on films such as The Invisible Man and Us. The score features a mix of electronic and orchestral elements, with a focus on creating a sense of unease and tension.\n\n# Release\n\n## Marketing\n\nThe marketing campaign for M3GAN was handled by Universal Pictures and Blumhouse Productions. The film's trailer was released in October 2022, generating a significant amount of buzz online. The campaign focused on highlighting the film's unique blend of horror and science fiction elements, as well as its strong female lead.\n\n## Home media\n\nM3GAN was released on DVD and Blu-ray in March 2023, featuring a range of bonus features, including deleted scenes and a making-of documentary.\n\n# Reception\n\n## Box office\n\nM3GAN was released in theaters on January 6, 2023, and was a commercial success, grossing over $100 million worldwide. The film performed particularly well in the United States, where it grossed over $50 million in its opening weekend.\n\n## Critical response\n\nM3GAN received generally positive reviews from critics, with many praising the film's unique blend of horror and science fiction elements. The film holds a 74% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with many critics praising the performances of the cast, particularly Allison Williams and Violet McGraw.\n\n## Accolades\n\nM3GAN received several award nominations, including a Saturn Award for Best Horror Film and a Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Sci-Fi/Fantasy Movie.\n\n# Future\n\nA sequel to M3GAN is currently in development, with Akela Cooper set to return as writer. The sequel is expected to explore the further adventures of M3GAN and Cady, and is expected to be released in 2024.\n\n# References\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)\n\n# External links\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"M3GAN\" following this outline:\n\n#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production\n##Development and writing\n##Casting\n##Filming\n##Visual effects\n##Music\n#Release\n##Marketing\n##Home media\n#Reception\n##Box office\n##Critical response\n##Accolades\n#Future\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Located in Hennepin County, it is situated on the banks of the Mississippi River, just north of its confluence with the Minnesota River. With a rich history, diverse culture, and a strong economy, Minneapolis is a vibrant and thriving city that offers a unique blend of urban excitement and natural beauty.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### Dakota homeland\n\nFor thousands of years, the area that is now Minneapolis was home to the Dakota people, a Native American tribe that inhabited much of the region. The Dakota called the area \"Mni aha ha\" or \"water falls,\" which referred to the 53-foot waterfall on the Mississippi River, now known as St. Anthony Falls. In 1680, French explorer René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, became the first European to visit the area.\n\n### Industries develop\n\nDuring the 19th century, Minneapolis experienced rapid growth and development, driven by the expansion of the lumber and flour milling industries. The city's location on the Mississippi River made it an ideal place for the transportation of goods, and the construction of the St. Anthony Falls Dam in 1848 provided a source of power for the city's mills. By the late 1800s, Minneapolis had become a major center for the production of lumber and flour, earning it the nickname \"the Mill City.\"\n\n### Social tensions\n\nAs the city grew and prospered, social tensions began to rise.
