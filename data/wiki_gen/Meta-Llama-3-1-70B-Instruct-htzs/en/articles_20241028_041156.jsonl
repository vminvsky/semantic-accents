Born on September 29, 1935, in Ferriday, Louisiana, Lewis is one of the pioneers of rock and roll, alongside Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry, and Little Richard. He is also known as \"The Killer\" for his dynamic stage presence and pounding piano style.\n\n#Early life\n\nJerry Lee Lewis was born to Elmo and Mamie Lewis, a poor farming family. He was the third of four children, and his family moved frequently during his childhood. Lewis's early life was marked by poverty and hardship, but music played a significant role in his family. His parents encouraged his musical talent, and he began playing piano at the age of nine. Lewis's mother mortgaged their home to buy him a piano, which became his primary instrument.\n\nLewis's musical influences were diverse, ranging from gospel to country to rhythm and blues. He was particularly drawn to the sounds of Hank Williams, Al Jolson, and Jimmie Rodgers. Lewis attended the Southwest Bible Institute in Waxahachie, Texas, but was expelled after three months for playing secular music.\n\n#Career\n\n##J&M Studio\n\nIn 1952, Lewis traveled to Shreveport, Louisiana, to audition for the Louisiana Hayride, a popular country music show. He was rejected, but he met J.D. Miller, a local record producer, and pianist. Miller signed Lewis to his J&M Studio label, and they recorded several singles, including \"Don't Stay Away (Till Love Grows Cold)\" and \"Crazy Arms.\" Although these recordings did not achieve commercial success, they helped Lewis gain regional recognition.\n\n##Sun Records\n\nIn 1956, Lewis traveled to Memphis, Tennessee, to audition for Sun Records, a fledgling label founded by Sam Phillips. Phillips was impressed by Lewis's talent and signed him to a recording contract. Lewis's first single for Sun, \"Crazy Arms,\" was a moderate success, but it was his next single, \"Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On,\" that brought him national attention. The song's success was followed by \"Great Balls of Fire,\" which reached number two on the Billboard charts.\n\n##Marriage controversy\n\nIn 1957, Lewis's career was derailed by a scandal surrounding his marriage to his 13-year-old cousin, Myra Gale Brown. The marriage was illegal in most states, and the public outcry led to Lewis's cancellation from several high-profile tours and television appearances. The scandal damaged Lewis's reputation and led to a significant decline in his record sales.\n\n##Smash Records\n\nIn 1963, Lewis signed with Smash Records, a subsidiary of Mercury Records. He released several albums, including \"The Return of Rock\" and \"Country Songs for City Folks.\" Although these recordings did not achieve the same level of success as his Sun Records era, they helped Lewis maintain a loyal fan base.\n\n##Live at the Star Club, Hamburg\n\nIn 1964, Lewis recorded a live album at the Star Club in Hamburg, Germany. The album, \"Live at the Star Club, Hamburg,\" is often cited as one of the greatest live rock and roll recordings of all time. The album's success helped revitalize Lewis's career and introduced him to a new generation of fans.\n\n##Country comeback\n\nIn the late 1960s, Lewis began to focus on country music, releasing several successful singles, including \"What's Made Milwaukee Famous (Has Made a Loser Out of Me)\" and \"To Make Love Sweeter for You.\" Lewis's country comeback was marked by several chart-topping hits, including \"There Must Be More to Love Than This\" and \"Would You Take Another Chance on Me.\"\n\n##Grand Ole Opry appearance\n\nIn 1973, Lewis became the first rock and roll artist to appear on the Grand Ole Opry, a prestigious country music institution. Lewis's appearance was a significant moment in his career, marking his acceptance by the country music establishment.\n\n##The Session and Southern Roots\n\nIn 1973, Lewis released \"The Session,\" a critically acclaimed album that featured several rock and roll classics, including \"Drinking Wine Spo-Dee-O-Dee\" and \"Sea Cruise.\" The album was followed by \"Southern Roots,\" a country-rock album that explored Lewis's southern heritage.\n\n##Later career\n\nIn the 1980s, Lewis continued to tour and record, releasing several albums, including \"Young Blood\" and \"Class of '55.\" Lewis's later career was marked by several collaborations, including a 1986 album with Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash, and Roy Orbison.\n\n#Music legacy\n\n##Accolades\n\nLewis has received numerous accolades throughout his career, including three Grammy nominations and several Country Music Association Awards. In 1986, Lewis was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and in 1998, he was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame.\n\n##Piano style\n\nLewis's piano style is characterized by his pounding, energetic playing. He is known for his ability to play complex rhythms and melodies, and his piano playing has been cited as an influence by several rock and roll artists, including Elton John and Leon Russell.\n\n#Personal life\n\n##Relationships and children\n\nLewis has been married seven times and has seven children. His most notable marriage was to Myra Gale Brown, his 13-year-old cousin, whom he married in 1957. The marriage was widely publicized and led to a significant backlash against Lewis.\n\n##Religious beliefs\n\nLewis was raised as a Pentecostal Christian and has maintained a strong faith throughout his life. He has often incorporated gospel music into his performances and has released several gospel albums.\n\n##Graceland arrest\n\nIn 1976, Lewis was arrested at the gates of Graceland, Elvis Presley's Memphis home, for brandishing a pistol and threatening Presley's bodyguards. The incident was widely publicized and further damaged Lewis's reputation.\n\n##Debt\n\nLewis has struggled with debt throughout his career, including a 1988 bankruptcy filing. He has also faced several lawsuits, including a 2010 lawsuit filed by his ex-wife, Kerrie McCarver.\n\n##Health and death\n\nLewis has struggled with health issues throughout his life, including a 2010 stroke and a 2019 hospitalization for pneumonia. He died on October 28, 2022, at the age of 87.\n\n#Selected discography\n\n##Compositions\n\n* \"Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On\" (1957)\n* \"Great Balls of Fire\" (1957)\n* \"Breathless\" (1958)\n* \"What's Made Milwaukee Famous (Has Made a Loser Out of Me)\" (1968)\n* \"To Make Love Sweeter for You\" (1968)\n\n#References\n\n##Sources cited\n\n* Lewis, Jerry Lee. 1996.

After the war, he became a key figure in the postwar espionage landscape, working for both the Gehlen Organization and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Von Bolschwing's life was marked by controversy, deception, and ultimately, scandal.\n\nEarly life and Nazi career\n---------------------------\n\n### Early life and business ventures\n\nOtto von Bolschwing was born on October 15, 1909, in Schönfließ, Pomerania, German Empire. He came from a noble family and was educated at a Gymnasium in Berlin. After completing his secondary education, von Bolschwing went on to study law and economics at the University of Berlin. However, he did not complete his studies, instead opting to pursue a career in business.\n\nIn the early 1930s, von Bolschwing became involved in various business ventures, including the import and export of goods. He also developed connections with influential figures in the Nazi Party, which would later prove beneficial to his career.\n\n### Mandatory Palestine\n\nIn 1933, von Bolschwing traveled to Mandatory Palestine, where he became involved in the local business community. He established connections with Jewish businessmen and politicians, which would later be used to his advantage in his role as an intelligence operative.\n\nDuring his time in Palestine, von Bolschwing became familiar with the local politics and economy, which would later serve him well in his role as a spy. He also developed a deep understanding of the Jewish community, which would be crucial in his future dealings with Jewish leaders and organizations.\n\n### Office of Jewish Affairs\n\nIn 1935, von Bolschwing returned to Germany and joined the SD (Sicherheitsdienst), the intelligence agency of the SS. He was assigned to the Office of Jewish Affairs, where he worked closely with Adolf Eichmann, who would later become infamous for his role in the Holocaust.\n\nVon Bolschwing's role in the Office of Jewish Affairs involved gathering intelligence on Jewish organizations and individuals, as well as developing strategies for the persecution and deportation of Jews. He became an expert in Jewish affairs and developed a network of contacts within the Jewish community.\n\nWorld War II\n------------\n\n### Romania\n\nIn 1940, von Bolschwing was assigned to Romania, where he worked as a liaison officer between the German and Romanian governments. He played a key role in the development of the Iron Guard, a fascist organization that would later become involved in the persecution of Jews and other minority groups.\n\nDuring his time in Romania, von Bolschwing became close friends with Ion Antonescu, the Romanian dictator. He also developed relationships with other key figures in the Romanian government, which would later be useful in his postwar career.\n\n### Downfall and imprisonment\n\nIn 1944, von Bolschwing was arrested by the SS for his involvement in a plot to overthrow Adolf Hitler. He was imprisoned in a concentration camp, where he remained until the end of the war.\n\n### Austria\n\nAfter the war, von Bolschwing fled to Austria, where he went into hiding. He assumed a new identity and began to build a new life for himself.\n\nPostwar espionage\n-----------------\n\n### Gehlen Organization\n\nIn 1946, von Bolschwing was recruited by the Gehlen Organization, a German intelligence agency that was established by the United States. He worked as a spy and intelligence operative, gathering information on Soviet activities in Eastern Europe.\n\nVon Bolschwing's work with the Gehlen Organization involved developing a network of contacts within the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. He became an expert in Soviet affairs and developed a deep understanding of the Soviet intelligence apparatus.\n\n### Central Intelligence Agency\n\nIn 1954, von Bolschwing was recruited by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), where he worked as a spy and intelligence operative. He was involved in various operations, including the development of a network of contacts within the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.\n\nVon Bolschwing's work with the CIA involved gathering intelligence on Soviet activities and developing strategies for the overthrow of communist governments. He became a key figure in the CIA's operations in Eastern Europe and developed a reputation as a skilled and ruthless operative.\n\n### Cover-up\n\nIn the 1960s, von Bolschwing's past as a Nazi SS officer began to come to light. The CIA attempted to cover up his involvement in Nazi atrocities, but the truth eventually emerged.\n\nVon Bolschwing's involvement in the Nazi regime and his role in the persecution of Jews and other minority groups was widely reported in the media. He became a symbol of the CIA's involvement with former Nazis and the agency's willingness to overlook past atrocities in the name of national security.\n\n### Emigration to the United States\n\nIn 1959, von Bolschwing emigrated to the United States, where he settled in California. He assumed a new identity and began to build a new life for himself.\n\nLife in the United States\n-------------------------\n\n### Business career\n\nVon Bolschwing became involved in various business ventures, including the development of real estate and the import and export of goods. He became a successful businessman and developed a network of contacts within the business community.\n\n### TCI scandal\n\nIn the 1970s, von Bolschwing became involved in a scandal involving the Transpacific Container Corporation (TCI), a company that was involved in the import and export of goods. The scandal involved allegations of bribery and corruption, and von Bolschwing was accused of using his connections with government officials to secure contracts for the company.\n\n### Later life and investigations\n\nIn the 1980s, von Bolschwing's past as a Nazi SS officer came under renewed scrutiny. He was investigated by the Office of Special Investigations (OSI), a unit of the Department of Justice that was established to investigate Nazi war crimes.\n\nVon Bolschwing's involvement in Nazi atrocities was widely reported in the media, and he became a symbol of the CIA's involvement with former Nazis. He died on March 7, 1982, at the age of 72, but his legacy as a ruthless and cunning operative continued to be felt for many years after his death.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nExternal links\n--------------\n\nBibliography\n------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Otto_von_Bolschwing\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and Nazi career\n##Early life and business ventures\n##Mandatory Palestine\n##Office of Jewish Affairs\n#World War II\n##Romania\n##Downfall and imprisonment\n##Austria\n#Postwar espionage\n##Gehlen Organization\n##Central Intelligence Agency\n##Cover-up\n##Emigration to the United States\n#Life in the United States\n##Business career\n##TCI scandal\n##Later life and investigations\n#References\n#External links\n#Bibliography\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He is also a businessman and media commentator, but his military career has been marred by allegations of war crimes, which have been the subject of extensive media coverage and investigations.\n\nEarly Life and Family\n--------------------\n\nBen Roberts-Smith was born on November 1, 1978, in Perth, Western Australia. He grew up in a military family and was educated at Hale School, a private boys' school in Perth. Roberts-Smith's father, Len Roberts-Smith, was a Vietnam War veteran and a prominent businessman. His mother, Sue Roberts-Smith, was a schoolteacher.\n\nRoberts-Smith's family has a strong military tradition, with his grandfather and great-uncle serving in World War II. He has two younger brothers, Sam and Matthew, who also served in the Australian Army.\n\nMilitary Career\n----------------\n\nBen Roberts-Smith enlisted in the Australian Army in 1996, at the age of 18. He completed his recruit training at the Australian Army Recruit Training Centre in Kapooka, New South Wales, and was then posted to the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3 RAR).\n\nRoberts-Smith served in East Timor in 1999 and 2000, as part of the United Nations peacekeeping mission. He was later deployed to Afghanistan in 2006, where he served with the Special Air Service Regiment (SASR). During his time in Afghanistan, Roberts-Smith was involved in several high-profile operations, including the Battle of Kakarak in 2006.\n\n### Military Decorations\n\nBen Roberts-Smith was awarded the Victoria Cross for Australia on January 23, 2011, for his actions during the Battle of Kakarak. He was also awarded the Medal for Gallantry in 2006, for his service in Afghanistan.\n\nRoberts-Smith's Victoria Cross citation reads:\n\n\"On the afternoon of 11 June 2006, during Operation Perth, Lance Corporal Roberts-Smith was a member of a Special Air Service Regiment (SASR) patrol that was engaged by a numerically superior enemy force in the Chora Valley, Afghanistan. The patrol was pinned down by heavy machine gun fire and was in danger of being overrun. Lance Corporal Roberts-Smith, without regard for his own safety, exposed himself to the enemy fire and moved forward to a position from where he could engage the enemy. He then, on multiple occasions, drew the enemy's fire and enabled his patrol to withdraw to a position of cover. His actions enabled the patrol to regroup and reorganize, and ultimately led to the enemy being defeated.\"\n\nCorporate Career\n-----------------\n\nAfter leaving the Australian Army in 2013, Ben Roberts-Smith pursued a career in business. He worked as a senior executive at the Seven Network, a major Australian media company, and later as the general manager of the Seven West Media company.\n\nRoberts-Smith has also worked as a business consultant and has been involved in various business ventures, including a failed attempt to launch a chain of gyms.\n\nOther Activities\n----------------\n\nBen Roberts-Smith has been involved in various charitable and community activities, including working with the Australian War Memorial and the Returned and Services League (RSL). He has also been involved in several business and community organizations, including the Australian Institute of Management and the Australian Chamber of Commerce.\n\nWar Crime Allegations\n---------------------\n\nBen Roberts-Smith has been the subject of allegations of war crimes, including the killing of unarmed civilians and prisoners of war. The allegations were first made public in 2018, and have since been the subject of extensive media coverage and investigations.\n\n### Investigation\n\nThe Australian government has launched several investigations into the allegations against Roberts-Smith, including a Royal Commission into the Australian Defence Force's handling of the allegations. The Royal Commission, which was established in 2020, is ongoing.\n\nDefamation Suit\n----------------\n\nBen Roberts-Smith has launched a defamation suit against the Australian media company, Fairfax Media (now known as Nine Entertainment), over the publication of the war crime allegations. The suit, which was filed in 2019, alleges that Fairfax Media published false and defamatory material about Roberts-Smith.\n\n### Judgment\n\nIn 2021, the Federal Court of Australia ruled in favor of Fairfax Media, finding that the publication of the allegations was not defamatory. The court found that the allegations were substantially true, and that Fairfax Media had a legitimate interest in publishing the material.\n\n### Appeal\n\nBen Roberts-Smith has appealed the Federal Court's decision to the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia. The appeal is ongoing.\n\nFurther Controversy\n-------------------\n\nBen Roberts-Smith has been the subject of further controversy, including allegations of domestic violence and bullying. The allegations, which were made public in 2020, have been denied by Roberts-Smith.\n\nPersonal Life\n-------------\n\nBen Roberts-Smith is married to Emma Roberts-Smith, a former model and businesswoman. The couple has two children together.\n\nRoberts-Smith is a keen sportsman and enjoys playing rugby and cricket.

The game took place on February 12, 2023, at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. The Kansas City Chiefs defeated the Philadelphia Eagles by a score of 38-35, earning their second Super Bowl title in four years.\n\n# Background\n\n## Host selection\n\nState Farm Stadium was chosen as the host site for Super Bowl LVII in May 2018, beating out a bid from the Miami Dolphins to host the game at Hard Rock Stadium. The NFL owners voted 24-3 in favor of Arizona, with one abstention. The stadium had previously hosted Super Bowl XLII in 2008 and Super Bowl XLIX in 2015.\n\n## Calls for location change\n\nPrior to the game, there were calls to change the location of the Super Bowl due to Arizona's voting laws, which some critics argued were restrictive and discriminatory. However, the NFL ultimately decided to keep the game in Arizona, citing the state's strong track record of hosting successful Super Bowls.\n\n## Indigenous representation\n\nThe Super Bowl LVII halftime show featured a performance by Native American rapper and singer Fancy Dance, which included elements of Indigenous culture and representation. The show also included a pre-recorded video message from the Navajo Nation, which highlighted the importance of Indigenous representation in sports and media.\n\n## Stadium playing surface\n\nThe playing surface at State Farm Stadium was a natural grass field, which was installed specifically for the Super Bowl. The field was grown in California and transported to Arizona, where it was installed in the stadium over the course of several days.\n\n# Teams\n\n## Kansas City Chiefs\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs entered the Super Bowl as the AFC champions, having defeated the Cincinnati Bengals in the AFC Championship Game. The Chiefs were led by quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who was making his third Super Bowl appearance in four years. The team's offense was also led by tight end Travis Kelce and wide receiver Tyreek Hill, who were both considered among the best players at their positions in the NFL.\n\n## Philadelphia Eagles\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles entered the Super Bowl as the NFC champions, having defeated the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC Championship Game. The Eagles were led by quarterback Jalen Hurts, who was making his first Super Bowl appearance. The team's offense was also led by wide receiver A.J. Brown and running back Miles Sanders, who were both considered among the top players at their positions in the NFL.\n\n## Playoffs\n\nThe Chiefs and Eagles both entered the playoffs as the number one seeds in their respective conferences. The Chiefs defeated the Jacksonville Jaguars and the Bengals in the AFC playoffs, while the Eagles defeated the New York Giants and the 49ers in the NFC playoffs.\n\n## Pre-game notes\n\nThe game was expected to be a high-scoring affair, with both teams featuring high-powered offenses. The Chiefs were favored by 1.5 points, according to most sportsbooks. The game was also expected to be a closely contested matchup, with both teams featuring strong defenses.\n\n# Broadcasting\n\n## United States\n\n### Television\n\nThe game was broadcast nationally on Fox, with Kevin Burkhardt and Greg Olsen serving as the play-by-play announcers. The broadcast team also included sideline reporters Erin Andrews and Tom Rinaldi.\n\n### Advertising\n\nThe Super Bowl is traditionally one of the most-watched television events of the year, and advertisers pay millions of dollars for commercial time during the broadcast. Some of the most popular Super Bowl ads of 2023 included a commercial for the electric car company Polestar, which featured a humorous take on the typical car ad, and a commercial for the beer company Bud Light, which featured a surprise appearance by the singer and actress Taylor Swift.\n\n### Ratings\n\nThe game was watched by an estimated 114.25 million viewers in the United States, according to Nielsen Media Research. This made it the most-watched television event of the year, and one of the most-watched Super Bowls of all time.\n\n### Streaming\n\nThe game was also streamed live on the Fox Sports app and on various other streaming platforms, including Hulu and YouTube TV. The stream was watched by an estimated 7.5 million viewers, according to Fox.\n\n### Radio\n\nThe game was broadcast nationally on Westwood One, with Kevin Harlan and Trent Green serving as the play-by-play announcers.\n\n## International\n\nThe game was broadcast in over 200 countries and territories around the world, and was translated into multiple languages.

The inquiry has been the subject of much controversy and debate, with opinions divided on its legitimacy and potential outcomes.\n\n#Background\n\nImpeachment is a constitutional process that allows Congress to remove a president from office for \"high crimes and misdemeanors.\" The process is outlined in Article II, Section 4 of the United States Constitution, which states that the president \"shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\" The impeachment process is typically initiated in the House of Representatives, where articles of impeachment are drafted and voted on. If a majority of the House votes in favor of impeachment, the case is then sent to the Senate for trial.\n\nIn recent years, there have been several instances of impeachment inquiries into presidents, including Richard Nixon, Bill Clinton, and Donald Trump. In each of these cases, the impeachment process was initiated in response to allegations of misconduct, including obstruction of justice, perjury, and abuse of power.\n\n#Initiation of the inquiry\n\nThe impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden was initiated in [date] by [member of Congress], who introduced a resolution calling for an investigation into allegations of misconduct by the president. The resolution was referred to the [House committee], which began conducting an investigation into the allegations.\n\nThe allegations against Biden center on [briefly describe the allegations, e.g. \"his handling of a particular policy issue\" or \"his interactions with a foreign leader\"]. The inquiry is focused on determining whether Biden's actions constituted a \"high crime or misdemeanor\" and whether he should be impeached and removed from office.\n\n#House committee investigations\n\nThe [House committee] has been conducting an investigation into the allegations against Biden, gathering evidence and testimony from witnesses. The committee has held several hearings and has issued subpoenas to various individuals and organizations, including [list specific individuals or organizations].\n\nThe investigation has been led by [chair of the committee], who has stated that the committee is committed to conducting a thorough and impartial investigation. However, the inquiry has been criticized by some as being overly partisan and motivated by politics rather than a genuine concern for the truth.\n\n#Witness credibility\n\nOne of the key challenges facing the inquiry is assessing the credibility of witnesses. Several witnesses have come forward with allegations against Biden, but their credibility has been questioned by some.\n\n##Alexander Smirnov\n\nOne witness who has been at the center of the inquiry is Alexander Smirnov, a [former aide/official] who has made several allegations against Biden. Smirnov has stated that [briefly describe Smirnov's allegations, e.g. \"Biden pressured him to take a particular action\" or \"Biden made a promise that he did not keep\"].\n\nHowever, Smirnov's credibility has been questioned by some, who point out that he has a history of [briefly describe any relevant information about Smirnov's past, e.g. \"making false statements\" or \"having a personal vendetta against Biden\"]. Despite these concerns, Smirnov's testimony has been seen as a key part of the inquiry.\n\n#Responses\n\nThe impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden has sparked a range of responses from different groups and individuals.\n\n##Republican reaction\n\nMany Republicans have expressed support for the inquiry, arguing that it is necessary to hold the president accountable for his actions. Some have also criticized the inquiry as being too narrow, arguing that it should be expanded to include other allegations against Biden.\n\n##Democratic reaction\n\nMany Democrats have criticized the inquiry as a \"witch hunt\" and have expressed concerns that it is motivated by politics rather than a genuine concern for the truth. Some have also argued that the inquiry is a distraction from more pressing issues, such as [list specific issues, e.g. \"healthcare\" or \"climate change\"].\n\n##Reaction from academics\n\nSome academics have weighed in on the inquiry, offering their perspectives on its legitimacy and potential outcomes. Some have argued that the inquiry is necessary to uphold the rule of law and ensure that the president is held accountable for his actions. Others have expressed concerns that the inquiry is overly partisan and could have unintended consequences for the country.\n\n#Analysis\n\nThe impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden has been the subject of much analysis and debate.\n\n##Legal standing\n\nOne of the key questions surrounding the inquiry is its legal standing. Some have argued that the inquiry is unconstitutional, as it does not meet the standard of \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" outlined in the Constitution. Others have argued that the inquiry is a legitimate exercise of Congress's authority to investigate the president.\n\n#Opinion polling\n\nOpinion polling has shown that public opinion is divided on the inquiry.\n\n##Support for inquiry\n\nSome polls have shown that a majority of Americans support the inquiry, arguing that it is necessary to hold the president accountable for his actions. However, other polls have shown that support for the inquiry is more divided, with some people expressing concerns that it is motivated by politics rather than a genuine concern for the truth.\n\n##Support for impeachment\n\nOpinion polling has also shown that support for impeachment is more divided. Some polls have shown that a majority of Americans do not support impeachment, arguing that it would be too divisive and potentially damaging to the country. However, other polls have shown that support for impeachment is more evenly split, with some people arguing that it is necessary to uphold the rule of law and ensure that the president is held accountable for his actions.\n\n#Outcome\n\nThe outcome of the impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden is uncertain. If the inquiry leads to articles of impeachment being drafted and voted on, the case will then be sent to the Senate for trial. If the Senate votes to convict, Biden could be removed from office. However, if the Senate votes to acquit, Biden will remain in office.\n\n#Notes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Impeachment_inquiry_into_Joe_Biden\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Initiation of the inquiry\n#House committee investigations\n#Witness credibility\n##Alexander Smirnov\n#Responses\n##Republican reaction\n##Democratic reaction\n##Reaction from academics\n#Analysis\n##Legal standing\n#Opinion polling\n##Support for inquiry\n##Support for impeachment\n#Outcome\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The album marks SZA's first full-length release in five years, following her critically acclaimed debut album Ctrl (2017).\n\n#Background\n\nIn the years leading up to the release of SOS, SZA had been teasing new music and experimenting with different sounds. In 2020, she released a string of singles, including \"Hit Different\" and \"Good Days,\" which hinted at a more experimental and introspective approach to her music. SZA also took time to focus on her mental health and personal life, using the hiatus to recharge and refocus her creative energy.\n\n#Writing and production\n\nSZA began working on SOS in earnest in 2021, collaborating with a range of producers and writers to craft a cohesive and introspective album. The writing process was deeply personal, with SZA drawing on her own experiences with love, loss, and self-discovery. The album features production credits from a range of notable producers, including Babyface, Don Toliver, and Rodney Jerkins.\n\n#Composition\n\nMusically, SOS is a genre-bending album that blends elements of R&B, hip-hop, and indie rock. The album features a range of tempos and moods, from the slow-burning introspection of \"Nobody Gets Me\" to the upbeat, experimental production of \"I Hate U.\" SZA's vocal delivery is equally versatile, ranging from soft and introspective to bold and experimental.\n\n#Title and artwork\n\nThe title SOS is a reference to the international distress signal, reflecting the album's themes of crisis and self-discovery. The album artwork features a photograph of SZA submerged in water, surrounded by flowers and debris. The image is a metaphor for the album's themes of transformation and rebirth.\n\n#Promotion\n\nSOS was preceded by the release of several singles, including \"Good Days\" and \"I Hate U.\" SZA also performed a series of live shows and festival appearances, including a headlining set at the 2022 Governors Ball Music Festival. The album was further promoted through a range of social media and online campaigns.\n\n#Critical reception\n\n##Reviews\n\nSOS received widespread critical acclaim upon its release. Reviewers praised the album's introspective lyrics, genre-bending production, and SZA's vocal delivery. Many critics noted the album's thematic coherence and emotional depth, with some describing it as a \"masterpiece\" and a \"game-changer\" for R&B.\n\n##Year-end rankings\n\nSOS appeared on a number of year-end lists, including Rolling Stone's 50 Best Albums of 2022 and Pitchfork's 50 Best Albums of 2022. The album was also named one of the best albums of the year by publications such as The New York Times and The Guardian.\n\n#Awards\n\nSOS received several awards and nominations, including a Grammy Award nomination for Best R&B Album. The album also won the BET Award for Album of the Year.\n\n#Commercial performance\n\nSOS debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart, marking SZA's first number-one album.

The outbreak resulted in significant damage and loss of life, with multiple tornadoes touching down over the course of four days.\n\n# Meteorological synopsis\n\n## March 24–25\n\nA strong low-pressure system developed over the southern Great Plains on March 24, bringing with it a cold front that stretched from Texas to Illinois. As the system moved eastward, it encountered a mass of warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico, creating a volatile mix of warm, humid air near the surface and cooler, drier air aloft. This setup led to the development of a strong squall line, which produced multiple tornadoes across the region.\n\n## March 26–27\n\nAs the low-pressure system continued to move eastward, it interacted with a second cold front that was moving southward from Canada. This interaction led to the development of a strong upper-level trough, which provided additional lift and instability to the atmosphere. The combination of the strong low-pressure system, the cold front, and the upper-level trough created a highly unstable atmosphere, leading to the development of multiple long-lived tornadoes.\n\n# Confirmed tornadoes\n\n## March 24 event\n\nA total of 15 tornadoes were reported on March 24, with the majority touching down in Texas and Oklahoma. The strongest tornado of the day was an EF2 that touched down in rural Texas, causing significant damage to homes and outbuildings.\n\n## March 25 event\n\nA total of 20 tornadoes were reported on March 25, with the majority touching down in Louisiana and Mississippi. The strongest tornado of the day was an EF3 that touched down in rural Louisiana, causing significant damage to homes and businesses.\n\n## March 26 event\n\nA total of 25 tornadoes were reported on March 26, with the majority touching down in Mississippi and Georgia. The strongest tornado of the day was an EF4 that touched down in rural Mississippi, causing catastrophic damage to homes and businesses.\n\n## March 27 event\n\nA total of 10 tornadoes were reported on March 27, with the majority touching down in Alabama and Tennessee. The strongest tornado of the day was an EF2 that touched down in rural Alabama, causing significant damage to homes and outbuildings.\n\n## Rolling Fork–Midnight–Silver City, Mississippi\n\nThe longest-lived tornado of the outbreak touched down in rural Mississippi on March 26, causing catastrophic damage to homes and businesses. The tornado, which was rated EF4, was on the ground for over 80 miles, making it one of the longest-lived tornadoes in Mississippi history.\n\n## Black Hawk–Winona, Mississippi\n\nA devastating EF3 tornado touched down in rural Mississippi on March 26, causing significant damage to homes and businesses. The tornado was on the ground for over 20 miles, making it one of the most destructive tornadoes of the outbreak.\n\n## Egypt–New Wren–Amory–Smithville, Mississippi\n\nA long-lived EF3 tornado touched down in rural Mississippi on March 26, causing significant damage to homes and businesses. The tornado was on the ground for over 40 miles, making it one of the most destructive tornadoes of the outbreak.\n\n## North West Point–Smiths Mill–Pine Mountain, Georgia\n\nA devastating EF3 tornado touched down in rural Georgia on March 27, causing significant damage to homes and businesses. The tornado was on the ground for over 20 miles, making it one of the most destructive tornadoes of the outbreak.\n\n# Non-tornadic effects\n\nIn addition to the tornadoes, the outbreak also produced significant non-tornadic effects, including strong winds, large hail, and heavy rain. The strong winds caused significant damage to trees and power lines, leaving thousands without electricity. The large hail caused significant damage to crops and vehicles, while the heavy rain caused flash flooding in several areas.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe tornado outbreak of March 24–27, 2023 had a devastating impact on the affected areas, with multiple communities left to pick up the pieces. The outbreak resulted in significant damage and loss of life, with multiple people injured or killed.\n\n## Political response\n\nThe outbreak prompted a swift response from government officials, with multiple states declaring states of emergency. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) also deployed resources to the affected areas, including personnel, equipment, and funding.\n\n## Mississippi\n\nThe state of Mississippi was particularly hard hit by the outbreak, with multiple communities affected. The state's governor declared a state of emergency, and the state's emergency management agency coordinated the response efforts.\n\n### Rolling Fork\n\nThe town of Rolling Fork was one of the hardest hit communities in Mississippi, with multiple homes and businesses destroyed. The town's mayor declared a state of emergency, and the town's emergency management agency coordinated the response efforts.\n\n### Amory\n\nThe town of Amory was also significantly affected by the outbreak, with multiple homes and businesses damaged.

The election was the 59th general election in Sweden and the first to be held under the new electoral system introduced in 2021.\n\n# Background\n\nThe 2022 general election was held against the backdrop of significant changes in Swedish politics. The previous government, led by Prime Minister Stefan Löfven, had been in power since 2014. However, Löfven's government had undergone significant changes in the lead-up to the election.\n\n## Löfven's Government\n\nStefan Löfven's government was formed in 2014 after the Swedish Social Democratic Party (SAP) emerged as the largest party in the Riksdag. Löfven's government was a minority government, relying on support from the Green Party and the Left Party. During its tenure, the government implemented several significant policies, including a major overhaul of the Swedish tax system and a significant increase in funding for education and healthcare.\n\nHowever, Löfven's government faced several challenges, including a major crisis in the Swedish migration agency and a significant increase in gang violence.

He is a member of the United National Party (UNP) and has been a key figure in Sri Lankan politics for over four decades.\n\n#Early life and education\n\nRanil Wickremesinghe was born on March 24, 1949, in Colombo, Sri Lanka. He comes from a prominent family of politicians and lawyers. His father, Esmond Wickremesinghe, was a lawyer and a politician who served as a member of the State Council of Ceylon. Wickremesinghe's maternal grandfather, D.R. Wijewardena, was a prominent lawyer and politician who served as a member of the Legislative Council of Ceylon.\n\nWickremesinghe received his primary education at Royal College, Colombo, and later attended the University of Ceylon, where he studied law. He graduated with a degree in law and was called to the bar in 1972.\n\n#Political career\n\nRanil Wickremesinghe's entry into politics was influenced by his family's involvement in politics. He joined the United National Party (UNP) in 1967 and quickly rose through the ranks. In 1977, he was elected to the Parliament of Sri Lanka from the Biyagama electorate.\n\n##Batalanda incident\n\nIn 1990, Wickremesinghe was embroiled in a controversy surrounding the Batalanda detention center, where hundreds of prisoners were allegedly tortured and killed. Wickremesinghe, who was then the Minister of Education, was accused of being involved in the cover-up of the incident. Although he denied any involvement, the incident damaged his reputation and led to widespread criticism.\n\n##First premiership (1993–1994)\n\nIn 1993, Wickremesinghe became the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka for the first time, succeeding Dingiri Banda Wijetunga. During his first premiership, Wickremesinghe implemented several economic reforms, including the privatization of state-owned enterprises and the liberalization of trade policies.\n\n##Opposition (1994–2001)\n\nIn 1994, Wickremesinghe's government was defeated in the parliamentary elections, and he became the Leader of the Opposition. During this period, he led the opposition to the government of Chandrika Kumaratunga, who had implemented several populist policies that Wickremesinghe opposed.\n\n###1999 presidential election\n\nIn 1999, Wickremesinghe contested the presidential election against Chandrika Kumaratunga. Although he polled well, he lost the election due to the support of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) and the Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) for Kumaratunga.\n\n##Second premiership (2001–2004)\n\nIn 2001, Wickremesinghe became the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka for the second time, after the UNP won the parliamentary elections. During his second premiership, Wickremesinghe implemented several economic reforms, including the signing of the Ceasefire Agreement with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).\n\n###Peace talks\n\nIn 2002, Wickremesinghe initiated peace talks with the LTTE, which had been waging a separatist war against the government since the 1980s. Although the talks were initially successful, they broke down in 2003 due to disagreements over the implementation of the Ceasefire Agreement.\n\n##Opposition (2004–2015)\n\nIn 2004, Wickremesinghe's government was defeated in the parliamentary elections, and he became the Leader of the Opposition for the second time. During this period, he led the opposition to the government of Mahinda Rajapaksa, who had implemented several authoritarian policies that Wickremesinghe opposed.\n\n###2005 presidential election\n\nIn 2005, Wickremesinghe contested the presidential election against Mahinda Rajapaksa. Although he polled well, he lost the election due to the support of the JVP and the JHU for Rajapaksa.\n\n###Dissent within the UNP\n\nIn 2011, Wickremesinghe faced a leadership challenge from within the UNP, led by Karu Jayasuriya and Sajith Premadasa. Although the challenge was ultimately unsuccessful, it weakened Wickremesinghe's position within the party.\n\n###End of the civil war and 2010 presidential election\n\nIn 2009, the Sri Lankan civil war ended with the defeat of the LTTE. In 2010, Wickremesinghe contested the presidential election against Mahinda Rajapaksa, who was seeking re-election. Although Wickremesinghe polled well, he lost the election due to the support of the JVP and the JHU for Rajapaksa.\n\n##Third, fourth and fifth premierships (2015–2019)\n\nIn 2015, Wickremesinghe became the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka for the third time, after the UNP won the parliamentary elections. During his third premiership, Wickremesinghe implemented several economic reforms, including the introduction of a new constitution and the establishment of a national unity government.\n\n###Foreign policy\n\nDuring his third premiership, Wickremesinghe implemented a foreign policy that was more aligned with the West. He strengthened relations with the United States and the European Union, and he supported the United Nations' resolution on human rights in Sri Lanka.\n\n###Government bonds controversy\n\nIn 2015, Wickremesinghe was embroiled in a controversy surrounding the issuance of government bonds, which were allegedly sold at a high interest rate to a company linked to the Prime Minister's friend, Arjuna Mahendran. Although Wickremesinghe denied any involvement, the incident damaged his reputation and led to widespread criticism.\n\n##Opposition (2019–2022)\n\nIn 2019, Wickremesinghe's government was defeated in the presidential election, and he became the Leader of the Opposition for the third time. During this period, he led the opposition to the government of Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who had implemented several populist policies that Wickremesinghe opposed.\n\n##Sixth premiership (2022)\n\nIn 2022, Wickremesinghe became the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka for the sixth time, after the resignation of Mahinda Rajapaksa. During his sixth premiership, Wickremesinghe implemented several economic reforms, including the introduction of a new economic plan and the establishment of a national unity government.\n\n#Presidency (2022–2024)\n\nIn 2022, Wickremesinghe became the President of Sri Lanka, after the resignation of Gotabaya Rajapaksa. During his presidency, Wickremesinghe implemented several economic reforms, including the introduction of a new economic plan and the establishment of a national unity government.\n\n##Crackdown on anti-government protests\n\nIn 2022, Wickremesinghe's government was criticized for its crackdown on anti-government protests, which were sparked by the economic crisis. Although Wickremesinghe denied any involvement, the incident damaged his reputation and led to widespread criticism.\n\n##Handling of economic crisis\n\nDuring his presidency, Wickremesinghe implemented several economic reforms, including the introduction of a new economic plan and the establishment of a national unity government. However, his handling of the economic crisis was criticized by many, who argued that it was inadequate and that it had worsened the crisis.\n\n##2023 local government elections\n\nIn 2023, Wickremesinghe's party, the UNP, performed poorly in the local government elections, which were seen as a referendum on his presidency. Although Wickremesinghe denied that the election results were a reflection of his popularity, the incident damaged his reputation and led to widespread criticism.\n\n##2024 presidential election\n\nIn 2024, Wickremesinghe contested the presidential election, but he lost to Dullas Alahapperuma. Although Wickremesinghe polled well, he lost the election due to the support of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) for Alahapperuma.\n\n#Family and personal life\n\nRanil Wickremesinghe is married to Maitree Wickremesinghe, a professor of English literature.

The incident sparked widespread protests and raised concerns about police brutality and systemic racism in the United States.\n\n#Background\n\nJayland Walker was born on December 16, 1996, in Akron, Ohio. He grew up in the city and attended Buchtel High School. After high school, Walker worked as a DoorDash delivery driver and was known to his friends and family as a kind and gentle person. Walker was also an avid music lover and enjoyed playing the guitar and writing songs.\n\nIn the months leading up to his death, Walker had been struggling with depression and anxiety. His family and friends reported that he had been seeking help and was taking medication to manage his symptoms.\n\n#Incident\n\nOn June 27, 2022, at around 12:30 a.m., Walker was driving his car in the downtown area of Akron when he was stopped by police officers. The officers were responding to a report of a suspicious vehicle, and Walker's car allegedly matched the description.\n\nAccording to police reports, Walker did not immediately stop his car and instead led the officers on a brief chase. Walker eventually pulled over, and the officers approached his vehicle. Walker then allegedly got out of his car and began to run away from the officers.\n\nThe police officers, who were later identified as Justin Franks, Ryan White, and Michael Pirkle, among others, chased after Walker and attempted to apprehend him. During the chase, the officers used their tasers and pepper spray on Walker, but he continued to run.\n\nAt around 12:45 a.m., the officers cornered Walker in a parking lot and opened fire, shooting him multiple times. Walker was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\n#Investigation\n\nThe Akron Police Department immediately launched an investigation into the shooting, which was led by the Ohio Bureau of Investigation (BBI). The BBI collected evidence from the scene, including body camera footage from the officers involved, and interviewed witnesses.\n\nThe investigation found that the officers had shot Walker a total of 46 times, with some bullets striking him in the back and others in the face and torso. The report also noted that Walker was unarmed at the time of the shooting.\n\nIn July 2022, the Akron Police Department released a report detailing the events leading up to Walker's death. The report stated that Walker had been driving erratically and had failed to stop for the police officers. However, the report also noted that the officers had used excessive force and that Walker's death was a result of \"a combination of factors, including the actions of the officers and the circumstances of the incident.\"\n\n#Body camera footage\n\nIn July 2022, the Akron Police Department released body camera footage from the officers involved in the shooting.

Once the capital of the Kingdom of Hawaii, Lahaina is now a popular tourist destination known for its rich cultural heritage, stunning natural beauty, and vibrant arts scene. This article provides an overview of Lahaina's history, geography, demographics, arts and culture, sports, and popular culture.\n\n# History\n\nLahaina's history dates back to the early 19th century, when it was a major center of commerce, politics, and culture in Hawaii.\n\n## Name\n\n### Modern name, etymology and pronunciations\n\nThe modern name \"Lahaina\" is derived from the Hawaiian words \"la\" meaning \"sun\" and \"haina\" meaning \"cruel\" or \"relentless\". The name is often pronounced as \"lah-HY-nah\" or \"lah-HAH-nah\".\n\n### Ancient names\n\nBefore the arrival of Westerners, Lahaina was known by several ancient names, including \"Lele\" and \"Mokuhinia\". These names referred to the area's fertile lands, abundant resources, and strategic location.\n\n## Early rulers\n\nLahaina was an important center of power and politics in ancient Hawaii. The area was ruled by a series of ali'i (chiefs) and monarchs, including Kahekili II, who established Lahaina as the capital of Maui in the late 18th century.\n\n## Western contact\n\n### Kahekili II\n\nIn 1786, Lahaina was visited by British explorer George Vancouver, who was received by Kahekili II. The meeting marked the beginning of Western contact with Lahaina and had significant consequences for the area's history.\n\n### Kamehameha I and Kamehameha II\n\nIn the early 19th century, Kamehameha I, the founder of the Kingdom of Hawaii, conquered Maui and established Lahaina as his royal capital. Kamehameha II, his son and successor, continued to rule from Lahaina until his death in 1824.\n\n### Christian missionaries\n\nIn 1820, Christian missionaries arrived in Lahaina, led by Hiram Bingham. The missionaries had a profound impact on the area, introducing Christianity, Western education, and modern agriculture.\n\n### Whaling\n\nDuring the 19th century, Lahaina became a major whaling port, with hundreds of ships visiting the area each year. The whaling industry brought significant economic growth and cultural change to Lahaina.\n\n### Kamehameha III\n\nIn 1825, Kamehameha III, the grandson of Kamehameha I, ascended to the throne and established Honolulu as the new capital of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Although Lahaina was no longer the capital, it remained an important cultural and economic center.\n\n### 20th century\n\nIn the 20th century, Lahaina experienced significant growth and development, driven by the tourism industry. The area became known for its historic sites, cultural attractions, and natural beauty.\n\n## 2023 wildfire\n\nOn August 8, 2023, a devastating wildfire broke out in Lahaina, forcing thousands of people to evacuate and causing widespread damage. The fire was eventually brought under control, but not before it had destroyed hundreds of homes and businesses.\n\n# Geography\n\nLahaina is located on the western coast of Maui, approximately 20 miles northwest of Kahului. The area is bounded by the West Maui Mountains to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west.\n\n## Climate\n\nLahaina has a tropical savanna climate, with warm temperatures and moderate humidity throughout the year. The area experiences a dry season from April to October and a wet season from November to March.\n\n# Demographics\n\nAs of the 2020 census, the population of Lahaina was approximately 12,702 people. The area is diverse, with a mix of Native Hawaiians, Caucasians, Asians, and other ethnic groups.\n\n# Arts and culture\n\nLahaina is known for its vibrant arts scene, with numerous galleries, museums, and cultural attractions. The area is home to the Lahaina Heritage Trail, a self-guided walking tour that explores the area's history and culture.\n\n# Sports\n\nLahaina is a popular destination for outdoor enthusiasts, with numerous beaches, parks, and recreational facilities. The area is also home to the Lahaina Civic Center, which hosts a variety of sports and cultural events throughout the year.\n\n# Popular culture\n\nLahaina has been featured in numerous films, television shows, and books, including the popular TV show \"Hawaii Five-O\" and the novel \"The Descendants\" by Kaui Hart Hemmings.\n\n# Gallery\n\n* Aerial view of Lahaina\n* Lahaina Heritage Trail\n* Lahaina Civic Center\n* Lahaina Banyan Court Park\n\n# See also\n\n* Kingdom of Hawaii\n* Maui\n* Hawaii\n* Lahaina Heritage Trail\n* Lahaina Civic Center\n\n# Notes\n\n* This article is based on general knowledge and does not include specific citations or references.\n\n# External links\n\n* Official website of Lahaina\n* Lahaina Heritage Trail\n* Lahaina Civic Center", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Lahaina,_Hawaii\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Name\n###Modern name, etymology and pronunciations\n###Ancient names\n##Early rulers\n##Western contact\n###Kahekili II\n###Kamehameha I and Kamehameha II\n###Christian missionaries\n###Whaling\n###Kamehameha III\n###20th century\n##2023 wildfire\n#Geography\n##Climate\n#Demographics\n#Arts and culture\n#Sports\n#Popular culture\n#Gallery\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The outbreak caused widespread damage and resulted in at least six fatalities.\n\n# Meteorological Synopsis\n\nThe outbreak was caused by a strong low-pressure system that developed over the southern Great Plains on March 20. The system intensified as it moved eastward, producing a strong cold front that swept across the region. Moist air from the Gulf of Mexico interacted with the cold front, creating a volatile mix of warm, moist air near the surface and cooler, drier air aloft. This led to the development of strong thunderstorms, some of which produced tornadoes.\n\n## March 21\n\nOn March 21, the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) issued a moderate risk (4/5) of severe thunderstorms for parts of the southern Great Plains, including Oklahoma, Texas, and Kansas. As the day progressed, multiple tornadoes touched down across the region, including a long-lived EF2 tornado that affected several counties in Oklahoma.\n\n## March 22\n\nOn March 22, the SPC issued a high risk (5/5) of severe thunderstorms for parts of the Southeast, including Alabama, Georgia, and the Florida Panhandle. The risk area included several major cities, including Birmingham, Atlanta, and Tallahassee. As the cold front moved eastward, multiple tornadoes touched down across the region, including several long-lived EF3 tornadoes.\n\n## March 23\n\nOn March 23, the SPC issued a moderate risk (4/5) of severe thunderstorms for parts of the Mid-Atlantic, including North Carolina, Virginia, and Maryland. As the cold front continued to move eastward, multiple tornadoes touched down across the region, including a long-lived EF2 tornado that affected several counties in North Carolina.\n\n# Confirmed Tornadoes\n\nA total of 83 tornadoes were confirmed across nine states during the outbreak.\n\n## March 21 Event\n\nA total of 23 tornadoes were confirmed on March 21, including:\n\n* Oklahoma: 11 tornadoes, including a long-lived EF2 tornado that affected several counties\n* Texas: 6 tornadoes, including an EF1 tornado that damaged several homes in the Dallas area\n* Kansas: 4 tornadoes, including an EF1 tornado that touched down in the Kansas City area\n* Arkansas: 2 tornadoes, including an EF1 tornado that damaged several homes in the Little Rock area\n\n## March 22 Event\n\nA total of 31 tornadoes were confirmed on March 22, including:\n\n* Alabama: 12 tornadoes, including several long-lived EF3 tornadoes that affected several counties\n* Georgia: 8 tornadoes, including an EF3 tornado that damaged several homes in the Atlanta area\n* Florida: 6 tornadoes, including an EF2 tornado that touched down in the Panama City area\n* Tennessee: 3 tornadoes, including an EF1 tornado that damaged several homes in the Chattanooga area\n* Kentucky: 2 tornadoes, including an EF1 tornado that touched down in the Lexington area\n\n## March 23 Event\n\nA total of 29 tornadoes were confirmed on March 23, including:\n\n* North Carolina: 12 tornadoes, including a long-lived EF2 tornado that affected several counties\n* Virginia: 8 tornadoes, including an EF2 tornado that damaged several homes in the Richmond area\n* Maryland: 4 tornadoes, including an EF1 tornado that touched down in the Baltimore area\n* South Carolina: 3 tornadoes, including an EF1 tornado that damaged several homes in the Columbia area\n* West Virginia: 2 tornadoes, including an EF1 tornado that touched down in the Charleston area\n\n## Gretna–Arabi–New Orleans East, Louisiana\n\nA long-lived EF3 tornado affected the Gretna, Arabi, and New Orleans East areas of Louisiana, causing widespread damage and killing at least one person. The tornado touched down in the late evening hours of March 22 and remained on the ground for approximately 30 miles.\n\n# Non-Tornadic Effects\n\nIn addition to the tornadoes, the outbreak produced widespread non-tornadic effects, including:\n\n* Large hail: Multiple reports of large hail were received across the region, including hailstones up to 2 inches in diameter.\n* Damaging winds: Strong winds caused widespread damage, including downed trees and power lines.\n* Flash flooding: Heavy rainfall caused flash flooding in several areas, including parts of Alabama and Georgia.\n\n# Preparations and Impacts\n\nThe outbreak had significant impacts on daily life, including:\n\n* School closures: Multiple school districts closed due to the severe weather threat.\n* Flight cancellations: Several flights were cancelled or delayed due to the severe weather.\n* Power outages: Widespread power outages were reported across the region, affecting thousands of homes and businesses.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe aftermath of the outbreak included:\n\n* Search and rescue efforts: Emergency responders conducted search and rescue efforts in affected areas, including the use of drones and K-9 units.\n* Damage assessments: Damage assessments were conducted in affected areas, with preliminary estimates suggesting hundreds of millions of dollars in damage.\n* Relief efforts: Relief efforts were established, including the distribution of food, water, and shelter to affected individuals.\n\n# See Also\n\n* List of tornado outbreaks\n* Tornadoes of 2022\n* Storm Prediction Center\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a factual summary of the tornado outbreak of March 21–23, 2022.\n\n# External Links\n\n* Storm Prediction Center\n* National Weather Service\n* Federal Emergency Management Agency", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Tornado_outbreak_of_March_21–23,_2022\" following this outline:\n\n#Meteorological synopsis\n##March 21\n##March 22\n##March 23\n#Confirmed tornadoes\n##March 21 event\n##March 22 event\n##March 23 event\n##Gretna–Arabi–New Orleans East, Louisiana\n#Non-tornadic effects\n#Preparations and impacts\n#Aftermath\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Considered one of the most prestigious awards in the climbing world, the Piolets d'Or recognizes exceptional ascents, innovative routes, and contributions to the sport.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Piolets d'Or was established in 1991 by the French magazine Montagne and the Groupe de Haute Montagne (GHM), a French mountaineering organization. The award was created to recognize and celebrate outstanding achievements in alpinism and rock climbing, with a focus on innovation, style, and commitment. Over the years, the Piolets d'Or has evolved to include multiple winners, new categories, and changes in the selection process.\n\nMultiple winners\n\nSeveral climbers have won the Piolets d'Or multiple times, including Reinhold Messner, Catherine Destivelle, and Ueli Steck. These repeat winners have demonstrated exceptional skill, dedication, and innovation in their climbing careers.\n\nCriteria\n\nThe Piolets d'Or selection process is based on several criteria, including:\n\n* Innovation and creativity in route selection and climbing style\n* Difficulty and technical challenge of the ascent\n* Commitment and perseverance in the face of adversity\n* Respect for the environment and local cultures\n* Contribution to the sport of climbing and mountaineering\n\nA jury of experienced climbers, mountaineers, and outdoor enthusiasts reviews nominations and selects the winners based on these criteria.\n\nReception\n\nThe Piolets d'Or has been widely recognized and respected within the climbing community, with many winners going on to achieve international recognition and acclaim. The award has also been praised for its emphasis on innovation, style, and commitment, which are considered essential values in the sport of climbing.\n\nCriticism\n\nDespite its prestige, the Piolets d'Or has faced criticism over the years, with some arguing that the selection process is subjective and biased towards certain types of climbing or climbers. Others have criticized the award for prioritizing flashy, high-profile ascents over quieter, more low-key achievements.\n\n2023 award (31st awards)\n\nThe 2023 Piolets d'Or ceremony took place on November 18, 2022, in La Grave, France.

Khan was shot and injured while leading a protest march towards Islamabad, the capital city of Pakistan. The incident sent shockwaves across the country and sparked widespread condemnation from politicians, civil society, and the general public.\n\n# Background\n\n## Ousting of Imran Khan\n\nImran Khan was ousted as the Prime Minister of Pakistan on April 10, 2022, through a no-confidence vote in the National Assembly. The vote was held after the opposition parties, led by the Pakistan Muslim League (N) and the Pakistan Peoples Party, tabled a no-confidence motion against Khan, citing his government's poor performance and alleged mismanagement of the economy. Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party had been in power since 2018.\n\n## 2022 Azadi March-II\n\nFollowing his ouster, Khan announced a nationwide protest march, dubbed the \"Azadi March-II,\" to demand fresh elections and the resignation of the newly appointed Prime Minister, Shehbaz Sharif. The march began on October 28, 2022, from Lahore and was scheduled to culminate in Islamabad on November 4, 2022. Khan and his supporters claimed that the march was a peaceful protest aimed at restoring democracy and the rule of law in Pakistan.\n\n# Shooting\n\nOn November 3, 2022, while leading the protest march in Wazirabad, Khan was shot and injured in an assassination attempt. The incident occurred at around 4:30 pm local time when Khan was standing on the container-mounted stage of his convoy. A gunman, later identified as Naveed, opened fire on the convoy, hitting Khan in the leg. The shooting also injured several other PTI leaders and supporters, including Senator Faisal Javed Khan and former Punjab governor Chaudhry Sarwar.\n\nKhan was immediately rushed to a nearby hospital, where he underwent surgery for his injuries. His condition was reported to be stable, and he was later shifted to a hospital in Lahore for further treatment.\n\n# Suspects\n\nThe suspect, Naveed, was immediately arrested by the police and taken into custody. According to initial reports, Naveed was a 35-year-old resident of Wazirabad who had been motivated by \"personal grievances\" against Khan. However, further investigations revealed that Naveed had been influenced by extremist ideologies and had been planning the attack for several months.\n\nThe police also arrested several other suspects, including Naveed's brother and a local cleric, in connection with the assassination attempt. The investigation is ongoing, and authorities have promised to bring the perpetrators to justice.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## Domestic\n\nThe attempted assassination of Imran Khan sparked widespread outrage and condemnation across Pakistan. Politicians from all major parties, including the ruling coalition, condemned the attack and expressed solidarity with Khan. The Prime Minister, Shehbaz Sharif, ordered an immediate investigation into the incident and vowed to bring the perpetrators to justice.\n\nCivil society and human rights organizations also condemned the attack, calling it a \"brazen attempt to silence a political leader.\" The Pakistan Bar Council, the apex body of lawyers in the country, demanded a thorough investigation and punishment for the perpetrators.\n\n## International\n\nThe international community also condemned the assassination attempt, with several countries and organizations expressing solidarity with Khan and the people of Pakistan. The United States, the United Kingdom, and the European Union issued statements condemning the attack and calling for a thorough investigation.\n\nThe United Nations Secretary-General, António Guterres, also condemned the attack, expressing concern over the \"increasingly violent\" political climate in Pakistan. The Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and the Commonwealth of Nations also issued statements condemning the attack and calling for calm and restraint.\n\n# See also\n\n* Assassination of Salman Taseer\n* Assassination of Benazir Bhutto\n* 2022 Pakistani constitutional crisis", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Attempted_assassination_of_Imran_Khan\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Ousting of Imran Khan\n##2022 Azadi March-II\n#Shooting\n#Suspects\n#Reactions\n##Domestic\n##International\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It was located in the region of Oltenia, in what is now southwestern Romania. The Banat of Craiova was a unique experiment in colonial administration, which had significant consequences for the local population and the region's cultural heritage.\n\n#History\n\nThe history of the Banat of Craiova is closely tied to the complex and often tumultuous relations between the Habsburg Monarchy and the Ottoman Empire.\n\n##Austrian conquest\n\nIn 1716, during the Great Turkish War, the Habsburg Monarchy, led by Prince Eugene of Savoy, launched a campaign against the Ottoman Empire. The Austrians quickly conquered the region of Oltenia, including the city of Craiova, which became the administrative center of the newly formed Banat. The city's strategic location made it an important hub for trade and commerce, and the Austrians saw it as a key location for expanding their influence in the region.\n\n##Government creation\n\nIn 1718, the Habsburg Monarchy established the Banat of Craiova as a separate administrative division, governed by a ban, or viceroy, appointed by the Emperor. The ban was responsible for collecting taxes, maintaining law and order, and overseeing the local economy. The Austrians also introduced a new system of administration, which was based on the principles of Enlightenment absolutism. This system emphasized the importance of rational governance, efficient administration, and economic development.\n\n##Boyar and peasant resistance\n\nThe local boyar class, who had traditionally held power and influence in the region, resisted the Austrian conquest and the establishment of the Banat. They saw the Austrians as foreign occupiers who threatened their privileges and way of life. The peasants, who made up the majority of the population, were also skeptical of the Austrians and their new system of administration. Many peasants saw the Austrians as exploiters who imposed heavy taxes and forced labor.\n\n##Austrian consolidation\n\nDespite the initial resistance, the Austrians were able to consolidate their power in the Banat of Craiova. They introduced new laws and regulations, which aimed to modernize the local economy and improve living standards. The Austrians also invested in infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and canals, which helped to stimulate trade and commerce. The city of Craiova became a thriving commercial center, and the region began to experience economic growth.\n\n##Ottoman reconquest\n\nIn 1739, during the Austro-Turkish War, the Ottoman Empire reconquered the Banat of Craiova. The Austrians were forced to withdraw, and the region was returned to Ottoman control. The Ottoman reconquest marked the end of the Banat of Craiova as a separate administrative division, and the region was once again governed as part of the Ottoman Empire.\n\n#Legacy\n\nThe Banat of Craiova had a lasting impact on the region and its people.\n\n##\"Colonial\" precedent\n\nThe Banat of Craiova was a unique experiment in colonial administration, which set a precedent for future colonial endeavors. The Austrians introduced a new system of administration, which was based on the principles of Enlightenment absolutism. This system emphasized the importance of rational governance, efficient administration, and economic development. The Banat of Craiova served as a model for future colonial administrations, including those established by other European powers.\n\n##Cultural survivals\n\nDespite the Ottoman reconquest, the Banat of Craiova left a lasting cultural legacy in the region. The Austrians introduced new customs, traditions, and institutions, which survived long after the Banat was dissolved. The city of Craiova continued to thrive as a commercial center, and the region experienced economic growth and cultural development. The cultural heritage of the Banat of Craiova can still be seen in the region's architecture, cuisine, and folklore.\n\n#Symbols\n\nThe Banat of Craiova had its own symbols, which reflected its unique history and cultural heritage.\n\n* The coat of arms of the Banat of Craiova featured a shield with the imperial eagle of the Habsburg Monarchy, surrounded by the symbols of the region's major cities, including Craiova.\n* The flag of the Banat of Craiova featured a white field with the coat of arms in the center.\n\n#Notes\n\nThe Banat of Craiova was a short-lived but significant experiment in colonial administration. Its legacy can still be seen in the region's cultural heritage and economic development. The Banat of Craiova serves as a reminder of the complex and often tumultuous relations between the Habsburg Monarchy and the Ottoman Empire, and its history continues to fascinate historians and scholars today.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Banat_of_Craiova\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Austrian conquest\n##Government creation\n##Boyar and peasant resistance\n##Austrian consolidation\n##Ottoman reconquest\n#Legacy\n##\"Colonial\" precedent\n##Cultural survivals\n#Symbols\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The election was the first to be held during the COVID-19 pandemic, and it saw a significant shift in the country's political landscape.\n\n#Background\n\n##Previous Election\n\nThe previous general election was held on May 9, 2018, which saw the Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition, led by Mahathir Mohamad, winning a majority of the seats in the Dewan Rakyat, the lower house of the Parliament of Malaysia. The Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition, which had been in power since independence, suffered a significant defeat.\n\n##Significant Events\n\nSeveral significant events took place between the 2018 and 2022 elections. One of the most notable was the COVID-19 pandemic, which had a major impact on the country's economy and public health. The government's handling of the pandemic was widely criticized, and it led to a significant increase in public dissatisfaction with the government.\n\nAnother significant event was the 2020–22 Malaysian political crisis, which saw a series of defections and realignments among the country's political parties. The crisis began in February 2020, when a group of PH lawmakers defected to the BN coalition, triggering a collapse of the PH government.\n\n##2020–22 Political Crisis\n\nThe 2020–22 Malaysian political crisis was a period of significant turmoil in the country's politics. It began on February 21, 2020, when a group of PH lawmakers, led by Muhyiddin Yassin, defected to the BN coalition. The defection triggered a collapse of the PH government, and Muhyiddin was appointed as the new Prime Minister.\n\nHowever, the new government faced significant opposition from the PH coalition, which claimed that the defection was unconstitutional. The crisis continued for several months, with both sides engaging in a series of negotiations and maneuvers.\n\nEventually, the crisis subsided, and a new government was formed. However, the crisis had a significant impact on the country's politics, leading to a period of instability and realignment among the country's political parties.\n\n#Electoral System\n\nMalaysia uses a first-past-the-post electoral system, in which the candidate with the most votes in each constituency wins the seat. The country is divided into 222 constituencies, each of which elects one member to the Dewan Rakyat.\n\nThe electoral system has been criticized for being biased towards the ruling coalition, which has traditionally been the BN coalition. The system has also been criticized for being prone to gerrymandering, which is the manipulation of constituency boundaries to favor one party or group.\n\n#Timeline\n\n##Dissolution of Parliament\n\nThe 14th Parliament of Malaysia was dissolved on October 10, 2022, after the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (King of Malaysia) granted the Prime Minister's request for a dissolution.\n\n##Dissolution of State Legislatures\n\nSeveral state legislatures were also dissolved, including those in the states of Kelantan, Terengganu, Kedah, and Perlis.\n\n##Pre-Nomination Events\n\nSeveral events took place before the nomination of candidates, including the announcement of the election date and the dissolution of the Parliament.\n\n##Timetable\n\nThe election timetable was as follows:\n\n* October 10, 2022: Dissolution of Parliament\n* October 20, 2022: Nomination of candidates\n* November 5, 2022: Early voting\n* November 19, 2022: Polling day\n\n#Last Election Pendulum\n\nThe last election pendulum shows the number of seats that each party or coalition needs to win to form a government. The pendulum is based on the results of the 2018 general election.\n\n#Political Parties and Candidates\n\n##Parties Represented in Current Legislatures\n\nSeveral parties are represented in the current legislatures, including the BN coalition, the PH coalition, and the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS).\n\n##Extra-Parliamentary Parties\n\nSeveral extra-parliamentary parties also contested the election, including the Malaysian United Democratic Alliance (MUDA) and the Parti Pejuang Tanah Air (Pejuang).\n\n##Nominated Candidates\n\nA total of 916 candidates were nominated for the election, including several high-profile politicians.\n\n#Campaign\n\n##Timing of Election\n\nThe election was held during the COVID-19 pandemic, which had a significant impact on the campaign. Several candidates and parties were forced to adapt their campaign strategies to comply with health protocols.\n\n##Youth Vote\n\nThe youth vote was seen as a key factor in the election, with several parties and candidates targeting young voters through social media and other channels.\n\n#Outgoing Members of Parliament\n\nSeveral outgoing members of Parliament did not contest the election, including the former Prime Minister, Mahathir Mohamad.\n\n#Opinion Polls\n\nSeveral opinion polls were conducted during the campaign, with some showing a close contest between the main parties.\n\n#Results\n\n##By Alliance\n\nThe results by alliance were as follows:\n\n* Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition: 81 seats\n* Perikatan Nasional (PN) coalition: 73 seats\n* Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition: 30 seats\n* Gabungan Parti Sarawak (GPS) coalition: 23 seats\n* Gabungan Rakyat Sabah (GRS) coalition: 6 seats\n* Independents: 2 seats\n\n##By Parliamentary Seats\n\nThe results by parliamentary seat were as follows:\n\n* Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition: 81 seats\n* Perikatan Nasional (PN) coalition: 73 seats\n* Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition: 30 seats\n* Gabungan Parti Sarawak (GPS) coalition: 23 seats\n* Gabungan Rakyat Sabah (GRS) coalition: 6 seats\n* Independents: 2 seats\n\n##State Assemblies\n\nThe results for the state assemblies were as follows:\n\n* Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition: 270 seats\n* Perikatan Nasional (PN) coalition: 209 seats\n* Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition: 114 seats\n* Gabungan Parti Sarawak (GPS) coalition: 76 seats\n* Gabungan Rakyat Sabah (GRS) coalition: 29 seats\n* Independents: 10 seats\n\n##Seats that Changed Allegiance\n\nSeveral seats changed allegiance during the election, including the parliamentary seat of Pekan, which was won by the PN coalition.\n\n#Aftermath\n\n##Formation of Federal Government\n\nThe formation of the federal government was delayed due to a dispute over the appointment of the Prime Minister.\n\n##International Reactions\n\nThe international community reacted cautiously to the election results, with several countries calling for a peaceful transfer of power.\n\n#See Also\n\n* 2022 Malaysian state elections\n* List of members of the Dewan Rakyat\n* List of members of the Dewan Negara\n\n#Notes\n\nNote: This article is a general overview of the 2022 Malaysian general election.

The bridge, also known as the Kerch Bridge, is a significant infrastructure project that was completed in 2018 and spans the Kerch Strait, linking Crimea to Russia's Krasnodar region.\n\n# Background\n\nThe Crimean Bridge was constructed by Russia after it annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. The bridge's construction was seen as a strategic move to solidify Russia's control over the peninsula and to facilitate the transportation of goods and people. The bridge is approximately 19 kilometers long and consists of two separate structures: a road bridge and a rail bridge. The explosion occurred on the road bridge, which carries vehicular traffic between Russia and Crimea.\n\nThe Crimean Bridge has significant economic and strategic importance for Russia. It allows for the transportation of goods, including oil and natural gas, between Russia and Crimea, and provides a vital link for the Russian military to supply its forces in the region. The bridge has also become a symbol of Russian power and control over Crimea.\n\n# Event\n\nOn October 8, 2022, at approximately 6:07 a.m. local time, a large explosion occurred on the Crimean Bridge. The explosion was reportedly caused by a truck bomb that detonated on the road bridge, causing significant damage to the structure. The blast was powerful enough to be seen and heard from a distance, and it sparked a large fire that burned for several hours.\n\nThe explosion occurred in the early morning hours, when traffic on the bridge was typically light. However, the blast still caused significant disruptions to traffic, and several vehicles were damaged or destroyed in the explosion. Miraculously, there were no reported fatalities in the blast, although several people were injured.\n\n# Immediate impact\n\nThe explosion on the Crimean Bridge had an immediate impact on traffic and transportation in the region. The road bridge was closed to traffic, and several nearby roads were also shut down as a precautionary measure. The rail bridge, which carries train traffic between Russia and Crimea, was also closed temporarily as a safety precaution.\n\nThe explosion also had an immediate impact on the local economy. Several businesses and industries in the region rely on the Crimean Bridge for transportation and logistics, and the closure of the bridge caused significant disruptions to these operations.\n\n# Structural damage to the bridges\n\nThe explosion on the Crimean Bridge caused significant structural damage to the road bridge. The blast damaged several spans of the bridge, and it also caused a significant fire that burned for several hours. The fire was eventually brought under control, but it caused additional damage to the bridge's structural components.\n\nThe full extent of the damage to the Crimean Bridge is still unknown, but it is clear that the explosion caused significant harm to the structure. The bridge's operator, the Russian state-owned company Russian Highways, has announced plans to repair the damage and restore traffic to the bridge as soon as possible.\n\n# Reaction\n\n## Ukrainian\n\nThe Ukrainian government was quick to condemn the explosion on the Crimean Bridge, calling it a \"terrorist attack\" and blaming Russian authorities for the blast. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said that the explosion was a \"clear example of the consequences of Russia's actions\" and called on the international community to increase pressure on Moscow.\n\n## Russian\n\nThe Russian government was also quick to respond to the explosion, with President Vladimir Putin calling it a \"terrorist attack\" and vowing to find and punish those responsible. Putin also announced plans to increase security measures on the Crimean Bridge and to improve the safety of the structure.\n\n## International\n\nThe international community was also quick to respond to the explosion on the Crimean Bridge. The United States, the European Union, and other countries condemned the blast and called for an investigation into the incident. The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting to discuss the explosion and its implications for regional security.\n\n# Aftermath\n\n## Effect on Russian forces\n\nThe explosion on the Crimean Bridge had a significant impact on Russian military forces in the region. The bridge is a critical transportation artery for the Russian military, and its closure caused significant disruptions to military operations. The Russian military was forced to rely on alternative transportation routes, including sea and air transport, to supply its forces in Crimea.\n\n## Effect on Russian government\n\nThe explosion on the Crimean Bridge also had a significant impact on the Russian government. The blast was seen as a major embarrassment for the Russian authorities, who had touted the bridge as a symbol of Russian power and control over Crimea. The explosion also raised questions about the safety and security of the bridge, and it sparked a major investigation into the incident.\n\n# Investigation\n\nThe Russian government has launched a major investigation into the explosion on the Crimean Bridge. The investigation is being led by the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB), which has announced plans to identify and punish those responsible for the blast.\n\nThe investigation is ongoing, but it is clear that the explosion on the Crimean Bridge was a major incident with significant implications for regional security. The international community is closely watching the investigation and is calling for transparency and accountability in the Russian government's response to the blast.\n\n# See also\n\n* Crimean Bridge\n* Russia-Ukraine relations\n* Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation\n* Russian military intervention in Ukraine\n\n# References\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)\n\n# External links\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Crimean_Bridge_explosion\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Event\n#Immediate impact\n#Structural damage to the bridges\n#Reaction\n##Ukrainian\n##Russian\n##International\n#Aftermath\n##Effect on Russian forces\n##Effect on Russian government\n#Investigation\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
