It is composed of various courts and tribunals, each with distinct jurisdictions and powers. The Polish judiciary plays a vital role in upholding the rule of law, protecting individual rights, and ensuring the stability of the country's democratic system.\n\n# Structure\n\n## Common courts\n\nCommon courts in Poland are responsible for adjudicating civil, criminal, and family law cases. They are divided into three tiers: district courts, regional courts, and courts of appeal. District courts are the first-tier courts, handling cases involving minor crimes, civil disputes, and family law matters. Regional courts serve as the second-tier courts, hearing appeals from district courts and handling more complex cases. Courts of appeal are the third-tier courts, hearing appeals from regional courts and providing final judgments in most cases.\n\n## Military courts\n\nMilitary courts in Poland have jurisdiction over cases involving military personnel, including disciplinary matters, crimes committed by military personnel, and matters related to military service. There are two types of military courts: military district courts and the Military Court of Appeal. Military district courts handle cases involving military personnel, while the Military Court of Appeal hears appeals from military district courts.\n\n## Supreme Court\n\nThe Supreme Court of Poland is the highest court in the country, responsible for interpreting the law and providing final judgments in cases involving the interpretation of statutes, regulations, and international agreements. The Supreme Court is composed of 120 judges, divided into four chambers: the Civil Chamber, the Criminal Chamber, the Labour and Social Security Chamber, and the Military Chamber.\n\n## Administrative courts\n\nAdministrative courts in Poland are responsible for adjudicating cases involving administrative decisions, including decisions made by government agencies and local authorities. There are two tiers of administrative courts: the Provincial Administrative Courts and the Supreme Administrative Court. Provincial Administrative Courts handle cases involving administrative decisions, while the Supreme Administrative Court hears appeals from Provincial Administrative Courts.\n\n## Constitutional Tribunal\n\nThe Constitutional Tribunal of Poland is a special court responsible for interpreting the Constitution and ensuring that laws and regulations are consistent with its provisions. The Constitutional Tribunal is composed of 15 judges, appointed by the President of Poland, the Sejm (the lower house of parliament), and the Senate.\n\n## State Tribunal\n\nThe State Tribunal of Poland is a special court responsible for hearing cases involving crimes committed by high-ranking government officials, including the President, Prime Minister, and members of parliament. The State Tribunal is composed of 19 judges, appointed by the National Council of the Judiciary.\n\n# Procedure\n\nCourt procedures in Poland are governed by the Code of Civil Procedure and the Code of Criminal Procedure. Cases are typically initiated by filing a complaint or indictment with the relevant court. The court then schedules a hearing, during which the parties present their arguments and evidence. The court may also appoint experts to provide testimony or conduct investigations. After considering the evidence and arguments, the court renders a judgment, which may be appealed to a higher court.\n\n# Staff\n\n## Judges and court assessors\n\nJudges in Poland are appointed by the President of Poland, on the recommendation of the National Council of the Judiciary. To be eligible for appointment, candidates must have a law degree, at least 10 years of experience as a lawyer or judge, and pass a rigorous selection process.\n\n### National Council of the Judiciary\n\nThe National Council of the Judiciary is a 25-member body responsible for recommending candidates for judicial appointments, including judges and court assessors. The Council is composed of judges, lawyers, and academics, appointed by the President of Poland, the Sejm, and the Senate.\n\n#### Procedure of appointment\n\nThe procedure for appointing judges and court assessors involves several steps. First, candidates must submit their applications to the National Council of the Judiciary. The Council then reviews the applications, conducts interviews, and selects candidates to recommend to the President of Poland. The President then appoints the recommended candidates to the relevant court.\n\n#### Rights and duties\n\nJudges and court assessors in Poland have several rights and duties. They are entitled to independence, impartiality, and protection from external interference. They are also required to uphold the law, ensure the fairness of proceedings, and provide reasoned judgments.\n\n## Judges sitting in the tribunals\n\nJudges sitting in the tribunals, including the Constitutional Tribunal and the State Tribunal, are appointed by the President of Poland, on the recommendation of the National Council of the Judiciary. They must have a law degree, at least 10 years of experience as a lawyer or judge, and pass a rigorous selection process.\n\n## Other judicial positions\n\nOther judicial positions in Poland include court clerks, court administrators, and judicial assistants. These positions are typically filled through competitive examinations or recruitment processes.\n\n## Remuneration\n\nJudges and court assessors in Poland are entitled to a salary, which is set by the Ministry of Justice. They also receive benefits, including health insurance, pension, and social security.\n\n# Minimal requirements\n\nTo be eligible for appointment as a judge or court assessor in Poland, candidates must meet certain minimal requirements, including:\n\n* Having a law degree\n* Having at least 10 years of experience as a lawyer or judge\n* Passing a rigorous selection process\n* Being a Polish citizen\n* Being at least 30 years old\n\n# Issues\n\n## Length of proceedings\n\nOne of the major issues affecting the Polish judiciary is the length of proceedings. Court cases often take several years to resolve, leading to frustration and disillusionment among litigants.\n\n## Lack of popular support and trust\n\nThe Polish judiciary has faced criticism and mistrust from the public, particularly in recent years. This has been attributed to various factors, including perceptions of judicial corruption, politicization, and lack of accountability.\n\n## Other issues\n\nOther issues affecting the Polish judiciary include inadequate funding, outdated infrastructure, and insufficient training for judges and court staff.\n\n## Rule of law concerns\n\nIn recent years, Poland has faced concerns about the rule of law, particularly with regards to the independence of the judiciary. These concerns have been raised by the European Union, the Council of Europe, and other international organizations.\n\n### Capture of the Constitutional Tribunal\n\nIn 2015, the Polish government passed a law that allowed it to appoint new judges to the Constitutional Tribunal, effectively taking control of the court. This move was widely criticized as an attempt to undermine the independence of the judiciary.\n\n### Undue influence on judges\n\nThere have been allegations of undue influence on judges in Poland, particularly by politicians and government officials. This has led to concerns about the impartiality and independence of the judiciary.\n\n### Partisan control of the National Council of the Judiciary\n\nThe National Council of the Judiciary has been criticized for being under partisan control, with some members allegedly having close ties to the ruling party. This has led to concerns about the politicization of the judiciary.\n\n#### Arbitrary secondment of judges\n\nThere have been cases of judges being arbitrarily seconded to other courts or duties, allegedly as a form of punishment or retribution. This has led to concerns about the independence and security of judges.\n\n### Repercussions in Poland and abroad\n\nThe concerns about the rule of law in Poland have had repercussions both domestically and internationally. The European Union has launched infringement proceedings against Poland, and the country has faced criticism from other international organizations and human rights groups.\n\n# See also\n\n* Constitution of Poland\n* Polish law\n* European Court of Human Rights\n* European Union law\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is based on publicly available information and does not represent the views of any individual or organization.\n\n# References\n\nThis article does not include any references or citations.\n\n# External links\n\n* Official website of the Polish judiciary\n* Official website of the Supreme Court of Poland\n* Official website of the Constitutional Tribunal of Poland", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Judiciary_of_Poland\" following this outline:\n\n#Structure\n##Common courts\n##Military courts\n##Supreme Court\n##Administrative courts\n##Constitutional Tribunal\n##State Tribunal\n#Procedure\n#Staff\n##Judges and court assessors\n###National Council of the Judiciary\n####Procedure of appointment\n####Rights and duties\n##Judges sitting in the tribunals\n##Other judicial positions\n##Remuneration\n#Minimal requirements\n#Issues\n##Length of proceedings\n##Lack of popular support and trust\n##Other issues\n##Rule of law concerns\n###Capture of the Constitutional Tribunal\n###Undue influence on judges\n###Partisan control of the National Council of the Judiciary\n####Arbitrary secondment of judges\n###Repercussions in Poland and abroad\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The incident sparked a diplomatic row between the two countries and raised concerns about national security, espionage, and the use of advanced surveillance technology.\n\n# Background\n\n## History and Development of Reconnaissance Balloons\n\nHigh-altitude balloons have been used for reconnaissance and surveillance purposes for decades. The first recorded use of balloons for military purposes dates back to the French Revolutionary Wars, when the French army used balloons to observe enemy positions. In the 20th century, the United States and the Soviet Union developed advanced balloon-based surveillance systems, including the U-2 and Corona spy balloon programs.\n\n## Past Chinese Balloons and Unidentified Objects\n\nChina has been using high-altitude balloons for military and scientific purposes since the 1970s. In 2019, a Chinese balloon was spotted over the United States, but it was not intercepted. In 2020, a Chinese balloon was detected over Japan, and in 2022, a Chinese balloon was spotted over the Philippines. There have also been reports of unidentified objects, believed to be Chinese balloons, being detected over Taiwan and India.\n\n## U.S.–China Tensions\n\nThe incident occurred against the backdrop of rising tensions between the United States and China. The two countries have been engaged in a trade war since 2018, and there have been numerous incidents of espionage and cyberattacks. The United States has also been critical of China's human rights record, particularly in Xinjiang, and has imposed sanctions on Chinese officials. China has responded by accusing the United States of interfering in its internal affairs.\n\n# Incident\n\n## Balloon\n\n### Size, Propulsion, and Payload\n\nThe balloon was estimated to be around 200 feet (60 meters) tall, with a payload of around 2,000 pounds (900 kilograms). It was propelled by wind currents and solar power, allowing it to stay aloft for extended periods. The payload was believed to include advanced sensors and communication equipment, including cameras, radar, and signals intelligence capabilities.\n\n### Signals Intelligence Capabilities\n\nThe balloon was equipped with signals intelligence capabilities, allowing it to intercept and collect communications signals from the ground. This could include cellular communications, radio signals, and even internet traffic. The exact capabilities of the balloon are not publicly known, but experts believe it could have been used to collect sensitive information about military and civilian targets.\n\n## Detection\n\nThe balloon was first detected on January 28, 2023, by the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) over Alaska. It was initially thought to be a weather balloon, but further analysis revealed its true nature. The balloon was tracked by NORAD and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as it entered Canadian airspace.\n\n## Flight Path\n\nThe balloon flew over the northwestern United States, including the states of Montana, Idaho, and Washington, before entering Canadian airspace. It was tracked by the Canadian military and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) as it flew over the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan.\n\n## U.S. Monitoring and Counterintelligence\n\nThe United States monitored the balloon's flight path and took steps to protect sensitive information. The FAA issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) warning pilots about the balloon's presence, and the military took steps to secure sensitive information.\n\n## Downing\n\nOn February 4, 2023, the United States military shot down the balloon off the coast of South Carolina. The balloon was destroyed by a Sidewinder missile fired from an F-22 Raptor fighter jet. The debris was recovered by the U.S. Navy and the Coast Guard.\n\n## Debris Recovery\n\nThe debris from the balloon was recovered by the U.S. Navy and the Coast Guard. The wreckage was taken to a secure facility for analysis, where experts were able to determine the balloon's true purpose and capabilities.\n\n# Legality of Airspace and Downing\n\nThe incident raised questions about the legality of the balloon's presence in U.S. airspace and the downing of the balloon. The United States claimed that the balloon was a threat to national security and that its downing was justified under international law. China claimed that the balloon was a civilian weather balloon that had strayed into U.S. airspace and that its downing was a violation of international law.\n\n# Response and Reactions\n\n## United States\n\nThe United States government condemned the incident as a \"clear violation of U.S. sovereignty\" and accused China of engaging in espionage. The incident was seen as a major embarrassment for the Biden administration, which had been criticized for its handling of relations with China.\n\n## Canada\n\nThe Canadian government expressed concern about the incident and called for an explanation from China. The incident was seen as a major test of Canada's relations with China, which have been strained in recent years.\n\n## China\n\nThe Chinese government denied any wrongdoing and claimed that the balloon was a civilian weather balloon that had strayed into U.S. airspace. China accused the United States of overreacting and violating international law.\n\n## NATO\n\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) condemned the incident as a \"clear violation of international law\" and expressed support for the United States and Canada.\n\n## Australia\n\nThe Australian government expressed concern about the incident and called for an explanation from China. The incident was seen as a major test of Australia's relations with China, which have been strained in recent years.\n\n## Japan\n\nThe Japanese government expressed concern about the incident and called for an explanation from China. The incident was seen as a major test of Japan's relations with China, which have been strained in recent years.\n\n## Singapore\n\nThe Singaporean government expressed concern about the incident and called for an explanation from China. The incident was seen as a major test of Singapore's relations with China, which have been strained in recent years.\n\n## United Kingdom\n\nThe British government expressed concern about the incident and called for an explanation from China. The incident was seen as a major test of the UK's relations with China, which have been strained in recent years.\n\n## Venezuela\n\nThe Venezuelan government expressed support for China and accused the United States of violating international law.\n\n## Media Reactions\n\nThe incident was widely covered in the media, with many outlets expressing concern about the implications for national security and international relations.\n\n### Analysis\n\nMany experts analyzed the incident as a major escalation of tensions between the United States and China. The incident was seen as a test of the Biden administration's handling of relations with China and a major challenge to U.S. national security.\n\n### Satire\n\nThe incident was also the subject of satire, with many comedians and commentators poking fun at the idea of a balloon being used for espionage. The incident was seen as a symbol of the absurdity of international relations and the lengths to which countries will go to gather intelligence.\n\n# Other High-Altitude Objects in February 2023\n\nIn the days following the incident, there were reports of other high-altitude objects being detected over the United States and Canada. These objects were later determined to be balloons or other harmless objects, but they sparked further concern about national security and the use of advanced surveillance technology.\n\n# Additional Assessments of the Balloon\n\nThe incident has sparked a major debate about the use of advanced surveillance technology and the implications for national security. Many experts have called for greater transparency and accountability in the use of such technology, and for greater cooperation between countries to prevent the misuse of such technology.\n\n# See also\n\n* Chinese espionage in the United States\n* Signals intelligence\n* High-altitude balloon\n* International law\n* National security\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a comprehensive overview of the 2023 Chinese balloon incident.

The team has a rich history, having participated in numerous international competitions, including the FIFA World Cup and the Africa Cup of Nations.\n\n# History\n\n## Pre-independence period\n\nFootball was introduced to Morocco in the early 20th century by French and Spanish colonizers. The first Moroccan football clubs were established in the 1920s, and the country's first national team was formed in 1928. During this period, Morocco played several friendly matches against other North African teams.\n\n## Beginning of Morocco (1955–1963)\n\nMorocco gained independence from France in 1956, and the country's football federation was established in 1955. The national team played its first official match in 1957, against Iraq, and went on to participate in several regional tournaments, including the Arab Games.\n\n## First appearances in international competitions (1963–1976)\n\nMorocco made its debut in international competitions in 1963, participating in the Africa Cup of Nations. The team also qualified for the 1970 FIFA World Cup, where it lost all three matches. Morocco continued to participate in the Africa Cup of Nations throughout the 1970s, but failed to advance beyond the group stage.\n\n## Between successes and defeats (1976–1986)\n\nMorocco experienced a period of moderate success in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The team won the 1976 Africa Cup of Nations, defeating Guinea 1-0 in the final. However, Morocco failed to qualify for the 1982 FIFA World Cup and was eliminated in the group stage of the 1984 Africa Cup of Nations.\n\n## Golden generation (1986–2000)\n\nThe late 1980s and 1990s are considered Morocco's \"golden generation.\" The team qualified for the 1986 FIFA World Cup, where it lost to West Germany and Poland. Morocco also won the 1988 Arab Nations Cup and finished runner-up in the 1992 Africa Cup of Nations.\n\n## Difficult years (2006–2017)\n\nMorocco experienced a decline in performance in the mid-2000s. The team failed to qualify for the 2006 FIFA World Cup and was eliminated in the group stage of the 2008 Africa Cup of Nations. Morocco also failed to qualify for the 2010 and 2014 FIFA World Cups.\n\n## Second golden generation (2017–present)\n\nIn 2017, Morocco hired Hervé Renard as its coach, marking the beginning of a new era for the team. Morocco qualified for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, where it lost to Iran and Portugal. The team also finished runner-up in the 2018 African Nations Championship.\n\n# Home stadium\n\nThe Morocco national team plays its home matches at the Stade Mohammed V in Casablanca, which has a capacity of 45,800 spectators. The stadium was opened in 1955 and has undergone several renovations since then.\n\n# Kit suppliers\n\nMorocco's kit supplier is Adidas, which has been the team's sponsor since 2012. The team's home kit is typically a combination of red and green, while the away kit is usually white or yellow.\n\n# Results and fixtures\n\n## 2023\n\n* March 25: Morocco vs. Brazil (friendly)\n*

In Alberta, Canada, the issue of orphan wells has become a significant concern due to the large number of wells that have been abandoned over the years. This article provides an overview of the current situation, context, and responses to the issue of orphan wells in Alberta.\n\n# Current Overview\n\nAs of 2022, there are over 170,000 inactive oil and gas wells in Alberta, with approximately 97,000 of these wells classified as orphan wells. The number of orphan wells in Alberta has been increasing over the years due to a combination of factors, including the decline of the oil and gas industry, company bankruptcies, and the lack of a comprehensive regulatory framework to manage well reclamation and abandonment.\n\n# Context\n\nThe oil and gas industry has been a significant contributor to Alberta's economy for decades. However, as the industry has matured, many wells have reached the end of their productive life and have been abandoned. In many cases, the companies that operated these wells have gone bankrupt or have abandoned their assets, leaving the wells without a responsible party to manage their reclamation and abandonment.\n\n# Landowners and Municipalities\n\nLandowners and municipalities in Alberta have been significantly impacted by the issue of orphan wells. Many landowners have had orphan wells left on their property, which can pose environmental and safety risks. Municipalities have also been affected, as they are often left to deal with the costs of managing and reclaiming orphan wells.\n\n# Orphan Well Association\n\nThe Orphan Well Association (OWA) is a non-profit organization established by the Alberta government to manage the reclamation and abandonment of orphan wells. The OWA is funded by the industry and the government, and it works to identify and prioritize orphan wells for reclamation and abandonment.\n\n# OWA Funding\n\nThe OWA is funded through a combination of industry and government funding.\n\n## Federal and Provincial Subsidies\n\nThe OWA receives funding from the federal and provincial governments through subsidies and grants. This funding is used to support the OWA's work in reclaiming and abandoning orphan wells.\n\n# Alberta Energy Regulator\n\nThe Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) is the primary regulator of the oil and gas industry in Alberta. The AER is responsible for ensuring that companies operating in Alberta comply with regulations and requirements related to well reclamation and abandonment.\n\n# Legal and Regulatory Considerations\n\nThere are several legal and regulatory considerations related to orphan wells in Alberta.\n\n## Polluter Pays Principle\n\nThe polluter pays principle is a key regulatory concept in Alberta, which holds that companies responsible for environmental damage should pay for the costs of cleanup and reclamation. However, in the case of orphan wells, the polluter pays principle is often not applicable, as the companies responsible for the wells have gone bankrupt or abandoned their assets.\n\n## Suspended Inactive Wells\n\nSuspended inactive wells are wells that have been temporarily abandoned but may still be reactivated in the future. However, many suspended inactive wells have been left in this state for extended periods, posing environmental and safety risks.\n\n# Bankruptcies and Orphan Wells\n\nBankruptcies have been a significant contributor to the issue of orphan wells in Alberta.\n\n## Strategic Packaging of Costly Liabilities with Productive Assets\n\nIn some cases, companies have strategically packaged costly liabilities, such as orphan wells, with productive assets in order to avoid taking responsibility for the costs of reclamation and abandonment.\n\n# Environmental Impacts of Orphan Wells\n\nOrphan wells can have significant environmental impacts, including fugitive gas emissions, surface casing vent flow, and gas migration.\n\n## Fugitive Gas Emissions\n\nFugitive gas emissions occur when methane and other gases escape from orphan wells, contributing to climate change and air pollution.\n\n## Surface Casing Vent Flow (SCVF) and Gas Migration (GM)\n\nSurface casing vent flow and gas migration occur when gases escape from orphan wells and migrate to the surface, posing environmental and safety risks.\n\n# Potential Geothermal Conversion of Orphan Wells in Alberta\n\nThere is potential for geothermal conversion of orphan wells in Alberta, which could provide a new source of renewable energy.\n\n# Responses\n\nThere have been several responses to the issue of orphan wells in Alberta, including government initiatives, industry-led solutions, and community-based efforts.\n\n# See Also\n\n* Oil and gas industry in Alberta\n* Environmental impacts of oil and gas development\n* Geothermal energy in Canada\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article provides an overview of the issue of orphan wells in Alberta, Canada. Further research and analysis are needed to fully understand the scope and complexity of this issue.\n\n# External Links\n\n* Orphan Well Association\n* Alberta Energy Regulator\n* Government of Alberta: Orphan Wells", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Orphan_wells_in_Alberta,_Canada\" following this outline:\n\n#Current overview\n#Context\n#Landowners and municipalities\n#Orphan Well Association\n#OWA funding\n##Federal and provincial subsidies\n#Alberta Energy Regulator\n#Legal and regulatory considerations\n##Polluter pays principle\n##Suspended inactive wells\n#Bankruptcies and orphan wells\n##Strategic packaging of costly liabilities with productive assets\n#Environmental impacts of orphan wells\n##Fugitive gas emissions\n##Surface casing vent flow (SCVF) and gas migration (GM)\n#Potential geothermal conversion of orphan wells in Alberta\n#Responses\n#See also\n#Notes\n#External links\n#Citations\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The crisis was triggered by a combination of factors, including high interest rates, declining asset values, and a loss of depositor confidence. The crisis led to the collapse of several major banks, including Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank, and prompted a response from regulators and policymakers to stabilize the financial system.\n\n# Background\n\nThe United States banking system had experienced a period of relative stability and growth following the 2008 financial crisis. However, the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent economic recovery led to a significant increase in government debt and a rise in interest rates. This, in turn, put pressure on banks' balance sheets and profitability.\n\nIn addition, the growth of shadow banking and fintech firms had led to increased competition for traditional banks, making it harder for them to attract and retain deposits. The rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) and cryptocurrency also posed a threat to traditional banking models.\n\n# Liquidation of Silvergate Bank\n\n## Background\n\nSilvergate Bank was a California-based bank that specialized in serving the cryptocurrency industry. The bank had grown rapidly in recent years, thanks to the surge in cryptocurrency prices. However, as the cryptocurrency market declined, the bank's deposits and assets began to shrink.\n\n## Events\n\nOn March 8, 2023, Silvergate Bank announced that it would be winding down operations and liquidating its assets. The bank's decision was reportedly due to a loss of confidence from its depositors and a decline in its asset values. The bank's collapse was seen as a precursor to the wider banking crisis that would unfold in the following weeks.\n\n# Collapse of Silicon Valley Bank\n\n## Background\n\nSilicon Valley Bank (SVB) was a California-based bank that specialized in serving the tech industry. The bank had grown rapidly in recent years, thanks to the surge in venture capital and startup activity. However, as interest rates rose, the bank's deposits and assets began to shrink.\n\n## Events\n\nOn March 10, 2023, SVB announced that it would be seeking to raise additional capital to shore up its balance sheet. However, the bank's efforts were unsuccessful, and on March 11, 2023, the bank was taken over by regulators. The bank's collapse was the largest in the United States since the 2008 financial crisis.\n\n# Collapse of Signature Bank\n\n## Background\n\nSignature Bank was a New York-based bank that specialized in serving the real estate and cryptocurrency industries. The bank had grown rapidly in recent years, thanks to the surge in real estate prices and cryptocurrency activity. However, as interest rates rose, the bank's deposits and assets began to shrink.\n\n## Events\n\nOn March 12, 2023, Signature Bank was taken over by regulators, following a run on the bank's deposits. The bank's collapse was seen as a sign of the growing instability in the financial system.\n\n# Collapse of First Republic Bank\n\n## Background\n\nFirst Republic Bank was a California-based bank that specialized in serving the wealth management and private banking sectors. The bank had grown rapidly in recent years, thanks to the surge in wealth creation and private banking activity. However, as interest rates rose, the bank's deposits and assets began to shrink.\n\n## Events\n\nOn April 1, 2023, First Republic Bank announced that it would be seeking to raise additional capital to shore up its balance sheet. However, the bank's efforts were unsuccessful, and on April 2, 2023, the bank was taken over by regulators. The bank's collapse marked the end of a tumultuous period in the US banking sector.\n\n# Aftermath\n\n## Bank Term Funding Program\n\nIn response to the banking crisis, the US Federal Reserve announced the creation of a new lending facility, the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP). The program would provide loans to banks for up to one year, using Treasury securities as collateral. The program was designed to provide liquidity to banks and stabilize the financial system.\n\n## Government discussion of other funding\n\nThe US government also discussed other funding options, including a potential bailout of the banking sector. However, the idea of a bailout was met with opposition from lawmakers and the public, who were skeptical of providing taxpayer support to the banking industry.\n\n## U.S. investigations\n\nSeveral US regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, launched investigations into the causes of the banking crisis. The investigations were expected to focus on the role of bank management, regulation, and supervision in contributing to the crisis.\n\n## Economic impact\n\nThe banking crisis had a significant impact on the US economy, leading to a decline in economic growth and a rise in unemployment. The crisis also had a global impact, leading to a decline in international trade and a rise in economic uncertainty.\n\n## International impact\n\nThe banking crisis had a significant impact on international financial markets, leading to a decline in stock prices and a rise in bond yields. The crisis also led to a decline in economic growth and a rise in unemployment in several countries, including the UK, Germany, and Japan.\n\n# See also\n\n* 2008 financial crisis\n* COVID-19 pandemic\n* Cryptocurrency\n* Decentralized finance\n* Fintech\n* Shadow banking\n* Silicon Valley Bank\n* Signature Bank\n* Silvergate Bank\n* First Republic Bank", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_United_States_banking_crisis\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Liquidation of Silvergate Bank\n##Background\n##Events\n#Collapse of Silicon Valley Bank\n##Background\n##Events\n#Collapse of Signature Bank\n##Background\n##Events\n#Collapse of First Republic Bank\n##Background\n##Events\n#Aftermath\n##Bank Term Funding Program\n##Government discussion of other funding\n##U.S. investigations\n##Economic impact\n##International impact\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He is known for his advocacy of Sikh rights and his calls for the establishment of Khalistan, a separate Sikh homeland.\n\nEarly Life\n-----------\n\nAmritpal Singh was born in 1993 in the village of Jallupur Khera in the Amritsar district of Punjab, India. Little is known about his early life, but it is reported that he comes from a family of modest means and was raised in a devout Sikh household.\n\nWaris Punjab De\n----------------\n\n### Succession to Deep Sidhu\n\nAmritpal Singh rose to prominence in 2022 after being appointed as the leader of Waris Punjab De, a Sikh activist organization founded by the late Deep Sidhu. Sidhu, a popular Punjabi actor and activist, had been a key figure in the 2020-2021 Indian farmers' protest and had gained a significant following among young Sikhs. After Sidhu's death in a car accident in February 2022, Amritpal Singh was chosen by the organization's leadership to succeed him as the new chief.\n\n### Campaigning and Prachaar\n\nUnder Amritpal Singh's leadership, Waris Punjab De continued to focus on issues such as Sikh rights, social justice, and the commemoration of Sikh historical events. The organization also engaged in prachaar, or outreach and publicity work, to spread its message and attract new supporters. Amritpal Singh traveled extensively throughout Punjab and other parts of India, delivering speeches and meeting with local communities to promote the organization's agenda.\n\n### Drug Rehabilitation\n\nOne of the key initiatives launched by Waris Punjab De under Amritpal Singh's leadership was a campaign to combat drug addiction among young Sikhs. The organization established a network of rehabilitation centers and counseling services to help individuals struggling with addiction, and Amritpal Singh personally participated in several high-profile raids on suspected drug dens.\n\n### Early Controversies\n\nAmritpal Singh's leadership of Waris Punjab De was not without controversy, however. Some critics accused him of promoting a radical and divisive agenda, and of using inflammatory language to whip up support among his followers. Others questioned his qualifications and experience, suggesting that he was not equipped to lead a major organization like Waris Punjab De.\n\n### Khalistan and Bhindranwale Styling\n\nAmritpal Singh has been accused of glorifying the Khalistan movement and promoting a radical, separatist agenda. He has also been criticized for his admiration of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, a Sikh militant leader who was killed in the 1984 Operation Blue Star. Amritpal Singh has been known to wear clothing and accessories similar to those worn by Bhindranwale, and has been accused of seeking to emulate the militant leader's style and legacy.\n\nPolitical Career\n-----------------\n\n### Member of Parliament\n\nIn 2022, Amritpal Singh announced his intention to run for the Indian Parliament as an independent candidate from the Amritsar constituency. Although he was ultimately unsuccessful, his campaign drew significant attention and support from young Sikhs and other marginalized communities.\n\nParticipation in Violence\n-------------------------\n\n### Ajnala Clash\n\nIn February 2023, Amritpal Singh was involved in a violent clash with police in the town of Ajnala, Punjab. The incident began when Amritpal Singh and his supporters attempted to storm a police station to free a detained activist, and escalated into a full-blown riot. Several people were injured, and Amritpal Singh was accused of inciting the violence.\n\nCrackdown and Arrest\n---------------------\n\n### Allegations and Charges\n\nIn March 2023, the Indian government launched a crackdown on Waris Punjab De and its leadership, accusing the organization of promoting separatism and violence. Amritpal Singh was arrested and charged with several offenses, including sedition and rioting.\n\n### Reactions\n\n#### Domestic\n\nThe arrest of Amritpal Singh sparked widespread protests and demonstrations across Punjab and other parts of India. Many Sikhs and other supporters of the organization accused the government of cracking down on dissent and suppressing Sikh rights.\n\n#### International\n\nThe international community also responded to Amritpal Singh's arrest, with several human rights organizations and Sikh groups expressing concern about the Indian government's actions. The United States, the United Kingdom, and other countries issued statements calling for calm and restraint, and urging the Indian government to respect the rights of all citizens.\n\nPersonal Life\n--------------\n\nLittle is known about Amritpal Singh's personal life, but it is reported that he is married and has several children. He is known to be a devout Sikh and has been involved in various charitable and social initiatives throughout his life.\n\nSee Also\n--------\n\n* Waris Punjab De\n* Deep Sidhu\n* Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale\n* Khalistan movement\n* Sikh nationalism\n\nNotes\n------\n\nThis article is a general overview of Amritpal Singh's life and career, and is not intended to be a comprehensive or definitive account.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Amritpal_Singh\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n#Waris Punjab De\n##Succession to Deep Sidhu\n##Campaigning and Prachaar\n##Drug rehabilitation\n##Early controversies\n##Khalistan and Bhindranwale styling\n#Political career\n##Member of Parliament\n#Participation in violence\n##Ajnala clash\n#Crackdown and arrest\n##Allegations and charges\n##Reactions\n###Domestic\n###International\n#Personal life\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The film is the sequel to Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (2018) and the third installment in the Jurassic World franchise, with Trevorrow also serving as executive producer alongside Steven Spielberg. The film concludes the Jurassic World trilogy and marks the final chapter in the story.\n\nPlot\n-----\n\nThe film takes place four years after the events of Fallen Kingdom. Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) and Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) are living in a world where dinosaurs and humans coexist. However, their peaceful life is disrupted when a new threat emerges in the form of a genetically engineered species of giant locusts that threaten the global food supply. Meanwhile, a rival biotech company, Biosyn Genetics, led by the enigmatic Lewis Dodgson (Campbell Scott), seeks to exploit the situation for their own gain.\n\nAs Owen and Claire navigate this new world, they must confront the consequences of playing with nature and the ethics of genetic engineering. Along the way, they team up with old allies, including Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill), Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), and Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), who have their own agendas and motivations.\n\nCast\n----\n\n* Chris Pratt as Owen Grady\n* Bryce Dallas Howard as Claire Dearing\n* Sam Neill as Dr. Alan Grant\n* Laura Dern as Dr. Ellie Sattler\n* Jeff Goldblum as Dr. Ian Malcolm\n* Campbell Scott as Lewis Dodgson\n* DeWanda Wise as Kayla Watts\n* Mamoudou Athie as Ramsay Cole\n* Isabella Sermon as Maisie Lockwood\n* Justice Smith as Franklin Webb\n* Daniella Pineda as Dr. Zia Rodriguez\n* Omar Sy as Barry Sembène\n\nProduction\n----------\n\n### Development\n\nIn 2018, it was announced that a third installment in the Jurassic World franchise was in development, with Colin Trevorrow set to return as director and co-writer.

The production team built several large sets, including a replica of the Biosyn Genetics headquarters and a futuristic research facility.\n\n### Creatures on screen\n\nThe film features a range of dinosaurs and other creatures, including the giant locusts that serve as the main antagonist. The creatures were brought to life using a combination of practical effects and CGI.\n\n### Post-production\n\nPost-production on the film began in early 2021, with Trevorrow working closely with the editing team to shape the final cut of the movie. The film's score was composed by Michael Giacchino, who had previously worked on the scores for the other films in the Jurassic World trilogy.\n\nMusic\n------\n\nThe score for the film was composed by Michael Giacchino, who had previously worked on the scores for the other films in the Jurassic World trilogy. The score was recorded with a full orchestra and features a range of themes and motifs that reflect the film's action-packed and emotional tone.\n\nMarketing\n----------\n\nThe marketing campaign for the film was launched in February 2022, with the release of the first trailer.

He played a crucial role in the establishment and development of the country's security apparatus, particularly the General Directorate for State Security (DGSP), also known as the Securitate. Throughout his career, Pintilie was involved in numerous human rights abuses, atrocities, and power struggles that shaped the course of Romanian history.\n\n#Biography\n\n##Youth and imprisonment\n\nGheorghe Pintilie was born in 1902 in the village of Popeni, Vaslui County, Romania. His early life and education are not well-documented, but it is known that he became involved in left-wing politics at a young age. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Pintilie was a member of the Romanian Communist Party, which was then banned by the authorities. He was arrested and imprisoned several times for his activities, including a five-year sentence in 1933 for \"crimes against the state.\"\n\n##Communist rise\n\nAfter his release from prison in 1938, Pintilie went underground and continued to work for the Communist Party. During World War II, he was part of the Romanian resistance movement against the fascist regime of Marshal Ion Antonescu. Following the Soviet occupation of Romania in 1944, Pintilie emerged as a key figure in the country's communist movement. He quickly rose through the ranks, becoming a member of the Central Committee of the Romanian Communist Party and a close ally of the party's leader, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej.\n\n##DGSP creation\n\nIn 1948, Pintilie was instrumental in the creation of the General Directorate for State Security (DGSP), which would become the country's main security agency. As the first director of the DGSP, Pintilie oversaw the development of the organization's structure, personnel, and operations. He modeled the DGSP after the Soviet KGB, with a focus on internal security, surveillance, and counter-intelligence. Under Pintilie's leadership, the DGSP quickly became a powerful tool for the Communist Party to suppress opposition, monitor the population, and maintain control.\n\n##Pushing for atrocities\n\nPintilie was a strong supporter of the Communist Party's radical policies, including forced collectivization, nationalization of industry, and the suppression of opposition. He played a key role in the implementation of these policies, often using brutal methods to silence critics and opponents. In the early 1950s, Pintilie was involved in a series of atrocities, including the forced relocation of thousands of people from the Danube Delta, the imprisonment of tens of thousands of peasants who resisted collectivization, and the torture and execution of suspected enemies of the state.\n\n##Brainwashing experiment\n\nIn the early 1950s, Pintilie was involved in a notorious brainwashing experiment known as the \"Pitești Experiment.\" The experiment, which was modeled after similar programs in the Soviet Union, aimed to \"re-educate\" prisoners through physical and psychological torture. Pintilie oversaw the implementation of the experiment, which was carried out at the Pitești prison. The experiment resulted in the deaths of hundreds of prisoners, and many more were left with permanent physical and psychological damage.\n\n##In the power struggles\n\nThroughout the 1950s and 1960s, Pintilie was involved in a series of power struggles within the Communist Party. He was a key ally of Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, but after Dej's death in 1965, Pintilie found himself at odds with the new party leader, Nicolae Ceaușescu. Ceaușescu saw Pintilie as a threat to his power and began to undermine his position within the party. In 1967, Pintilie was removed as director of the DGSP and replaced by Ion Stănescu, a loyal supporter of Ceaușescu.\n\n##Political isolation\n\nFollowing his removal from the DGSP, Pintilie was gradually isolated from power. He was no longer a member of the Central Committee, and his influence within the party was greatly diminished. In the early 1970s, Pintilie was forced into retirement, and he lived the rest of his life in relative obscurity.\n\n##Downfall\n\nGheorghe Pintilie died in 1985, at the age of 83. His legacy as a key figure in the early years of the Communist regime in Romania is still controversial today. While he played a crucial role in the establishment and development of the country's security apparatus, his involvement in numerous human rights abuses, atrocities, and power struggles has left a lasting stain on his reputation.\n\n#Notes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Gheorghe_Pintilie\" following this outline:\n\n#Biography\n##Youth and imprisonment\n##Communist rise\n##DGSP creation\n##Pushing for atrocities\n##Brainwashing experiment\n##In the power struggles\n##Political isolation\n##Downfall\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This outbreak was one of the most significant December tornado outbreaks on record, affecting multiple states and causing significant damage and loss of life.\n\n# Meteorological Synopsis\n\nA powerful low-pressure system developed over the Rocky Mountains on December 11, 2022, and began to move eastward towards the Great Plains. As it interacted with a strong cold front, a significant amount of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico was drawn into the system, leading to a high level of instability in the atmosphere. This instability, combined with strong wind shear, created a favorable environment for thunderstorms to develop and intensify.\n\nAs the system moved eastward, it encountered a strong upper-level jet stream, which provided additional lift and helped to fuel the development of strong updrafts. The combination of these factors led to the development of a large outbreak of tornadoes across the Southern United States.\n\n# Confirmed Tornadoes\n\n## December 12 Event\n\nThe outbreak began on the afternoon of December 12, with multiple tornadoes reported across Oklahoma and Texas. One of the strongest tornadoes of the day occurred in the town of Idabel, Oklahoma, where a EF3 tornado caused significant damage and injured multiple people.\n\n## December 13 Event\n\nDecember 13 saw a significant increase in tornado activity, with multiple long-lived tornadoes reported across Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama.

The mission is a follow-up to Chandrayaan-2, which successfully orbited the Moon but failed to soft-land on its surface in 2019. Chandrayaan-3 is designed to demonstrate India's capability to soft-land on the lunar surface and conduct in-situ scientific experiments.\n\n# History\n\nChandrayaan-3 was approved by the Indian government in January 2019, with a budget of ₹615 crore (approximately $85 million USD). The mission was initially planned for launch in 2020, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic and technical issues, the launch was postponed several times. The spacecraft was finally launched on July 14, 2023, from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh.\n\n# Objectives\n\nThe primary objective of Chandrayaan-3 is to demonstrate the capability to soft-land on the lunar surface. The mission aims to achieve this by developing and testing a new lunar lander, Vikram, which is designed to descend to the lunar surface from an altitude of 100 km. The mission also aims to conduct in-situ scientific experiments on the lunar surface using a rover, Pragyan.\n\n# Spacecraft\n\n## Design\n\nChandrayaan-3 consists of three main components: the propulsion module, the Vikram lander, and the Pragyan rover.\n\n### Propulsion module\n\nThe propulsion module is the main spacecraft that carries the Vikram lander and the Pragyan rover to the lunar orbit. It is equipped with a high-gain antenna, a solar panel, and a propulsion system that enables the spacecraft to travel to the Moon and enter into lunar orbit.\n\n### Vikram lander\n\nThe Vikram lander is designed to separate from the propulsion module and descend to the lunar surface. It is equipped with a terrain mapping camera, a hazard avoidance camera, and a radar altimeter that enable it to navigate and land safely on the lunar surface.\n\n### Rover Pragyan\n\nThe Pragyan rover is a small, six-wheeled rover that is designed to move around on the lunar surface and conduct scientific experiments. It is equipped with a camera, an alpha-proton X-ray spectrometer, and a laser-induced breakdown spectroscope that enable it to analyze the lunar regolith and rocks.\n\n## Payloads\n\n### On lander\n\nThe Vikram lander carries several payloads, including:\n\n* Terrain mapping camera: a high-resolution camera that captures images of the lunar surface\n* Hazard avoidance camera: a camera that captures images of the lunar surface to enable safe landing\n* Radar altimeter: a radar system that measures the altitude of the lander above the lunar surface\n* Seismometer: an instrument that measures the seismic activity on the lunar surface\n\n### On rover\n\nThe Pragyan rover carries several payloads, including:\n\n* Camera: a high-resolution camera that captures images of the lunar surface\n* Alpha-proton X-ray spectrometer: an instrument that analyzes the elemental composition of the lunar regolith and rocks\n* Laser-induced breakdown spectroscope: an instrument that analyzes the elemental composition of the lunar regolith and rocks\n\n### On the propulsion module\n\nThe propulsion module carries several payloads, including:\n\n* High-gain antenna: a communication antenna that enables communication with Earth\n* Solar panel: a panel that generates power for the spacecraft\n* Propulsion system: a system that enables the spacecraft to travel to the Moon and enter into lunar orbit\n\n# Mission profile\n\n## Launch\n\nChandrayaan-3 was launched on July 14, 2023, from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh. The spacecraft was launched on a GSLV Mk III rocket, which placed it into a highly elliptical Earth orbit.\n\n## Orbit\n\nAfter launch, the spacecraft traveled to the Moon and entered into lunar orbit. The spacecraft orbited the Moon several times before the Vikram lander separated and descended to the lunar surface.\n\n## Landing\n\nThe Vikram lander successfully landed on the lunar surface on August 23, 2023. The lander touched down in the lunar south pole region, near the Shackleton crater.\n\n## Surface operations\n\nAfter landing, the Pragyan rover separated from the Vikram lander and began to move around on the lunar surface. The rover conducted several scientific experiments, including analyzing the lunar regolith and rocks.\n\n## Propulsion module reinserted to orbit around Earth\n\nAfter the Vikram lander and the Pragyan rover completed their mission, the propulsion module was reinserted into orbit around Earth. The propulsion module will continue to orbit Earth for several years, conducting scientific experiments and testing new technologies.\n\n## Mission life\n\nThe mission life of Chandrayaan-3 is expected to be several years. The spacecraft will continue to orbit the Moon and conduct scientific experiments until its fuel is depleted.\n\n# Team\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 mission was developed by a team of scientists and engineers from the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). The team was led by Dr. K. Sivan, the Chairman of ISRO.\n\n# Funding\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 mission was funded by the Indian government, with a budget of ₹615 crore (approximately $85 million USD).\n\n# Results\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 mission has achieved several significant results, including:\n\n## Temperature variation\n\nThe Pragyan rover has measured the temperature variation on the lunar surface, which has helped scientists to understand the thermal environment of the Moon.\n\n## Detection of sulfur\n\nThe Pragyan rover has detected sulfur on the lunar surface, which has provided new insights into the geological history of the Moon.\n\n## Plasma measurement\n\nThe Vikram lander has measured the plasma environment on the lunar surface, which has helped scientists to understand the interaction between the solar wind and the lunar surface.\n\n## Seismic measurements\n\nThe Vikram lander has measured the seismic activity on the lunar surface, which has provided new insights into the internal structure of the Moon.\n\n# Domestic reactions\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 mission has received widespread coverage and acclaim in India. The mission has been hailed as a major achievement for the Indian space program and has sparked widespread interest in space exploration among the Indian public.\n\n# International reactions\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 mission has also received international attention and acclaim. The mission has been recognized as a significant achievement for the global space community and has demonstrated India's growing capabilities in space exploration.\n\n# Awards\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 mission has received several awards and recognition, including the \"Space Pioneer Award\" from the International Space University.\n\n# See also\n\n* Chandrayaan-1\n* Chandrayaan-2\n* Indian Space Research Organisation\n* Lunar exploration\n* Space exploration\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is based on publicly available information and may not reflect the most up-to-date information on the Chandrayaan-3 mission.\n\n# References\n\nNone\n\n# External links\n\n* Indian Space Research Organisation\n* Chandrayaan-3 mission website\n* NASA's Lunar Exploration Program", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Chandrayaan-3\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n#Objectives\n#Spacecraft\n##Design\n###Propulsion module\n###Vikram lander\n###Rover pragyan\n##Payloads\n###On lander\n###On rover\n###On the propulsion module\n#Mission profile\n##Launch\n##Orbit\n##Landing\n##Surface operations\n##Propulsion module reinserted to orbit around Earth\n##Mission life\n#Team\n#Funding\n#Results\n##Temperature variation\n##Detection of sulfur\n##Plasma measurement\n##Seismic measurements\n#Domestic reactions\n#International reactions\n#Awards\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The violence resulted in significant loss of life, displacement of people, and widespread destruction of property.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Scheduled Tribe status for Meitei\n\nThe Meitei community, which is the largest ethnic group in Manipur, has been demanding Scheduled Tribe (ST) status for several years. The ST status is a constitutional provision that provides certain benefits and reservations to historically disadvantaged communities in India. The Meitei community argues that they have been historically marginalized and excluded from the benefits of development, and that the ST status would provide them with greater access to education, employment, and economic opportunities.\n\n### Political background\n\nManipur has a complex political landscape, with multiple ethnic groups vying for power and influence. The state has a long history of insurgency and militancy, with several armed groups operating in the region. The state government has been criticized for its handling of the situation, with many accusing it of being ineffective and biased towards certain communities.\n\n### Refugees from Myanmar\n\nIn recent years, Manipur has seen an influx of refugees from Myanmar, who have fled their country due to conflict and persecution. Many of these refugees have settled in Manipur, which has put a strain on the state's resources and infrastructure. The presence of these refugees has also contributed to tensions between different ethnic groups in the state.\n\n### International factors\n\nThe violence in Manipur has been influenced by international factors, including the presence of armed groups and the flow of arms and ammunition from neighboring countries. The state's proximity to the international border with Myanmar has made it vulnerable to the influence of external forces.\n\n**Antecedents**\n\nThe violence in Manipur did not occur in a vacuum. There were several incidents and events in the months leading up to the violence that contributed to the tensions between different ethnic groups. These included clashes between Meitei and Kuki students, attacks on Meitei villages by Kuki militants, and the killing of a Meitei youth by Kuki militants.\n\n**Overview**\n\n### Initial riots\n\nThe violence began on May 3, 2023, when a group of Meitei youths clashed with Kuki students in Imphal, the capital city of Manipur. The clashes quickly spread to other parts of the city, with both sides attacking each other's homes and businesses. The police were initially unable to control the situation, and the violence continued for several days.\n\n### Government response\n\nThe state government responded to the violence by imposing a curfew and deploying security forces in affected areas. However, the government was criticized for its slow response and its failure to prevent the violence from spreading. The government also established a relief camp for people displaced by the violence, but many complained about the poor conditions in the camp.\n\n### Recurrent violence\n\nDespite the initial efforts to control the situation, the violence continued to recur in different parts of the state. There were reports of attacks on Meitei villages by Kuki militants, and of retaliatory attacks by Meitei militants on Kuki villages. The violence also spread to other ethnic groups, including the Naga and the Hmar.\n\n### Warring groups\n\nSeveral armed groups were involved in the violence, including the Kuki National Army (KNA) and the Meitei National Front (MNF). These groups have been responsible for many of the attacks and killings, and have contributed to the escalation of the violence.\n\n### Casualties and victims\n\nThe violence has resulted in significant loss of life, with over 100 people killed and many more injured. Many people have also been displaced, with thousands forced to flee their homes and seek shelter in relief camps. The violence has also caused widespread destruction of property, with many homes and businesses destroyed or damaged.\n\n**Supreme Court proceedings**\n\nThe Supreme Court of India has taken cognizance of the violence in Manipur and has issued several orders to the state government to take steps to control the situation. The court has also appointed a special committee to investigate the violence and to recommend measures to prevent such incidents in the future.\n\n**Reactions**\n\nThe violence in Manipur has been widely condemned by different sections of society, including politicians, civil society groups, and the media.

The work is based on a ballet scenario by Rafael Hertzberg and premiered in 1896. The opera's storyline revolves around a princess held captive in a tower by her wicked aunt, and her subsequent rescue by a brave prince.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### Composition\n\nSibelius began working on The Maiden in the Tower in 1896, shortly after completing his symphonic poem, The Swan of Tuonela. The composer was drawn to the project due to the ballet scenario's dramatic potential and the opportunity to experiment with new musical styles. Sibelius collaborated with Hertzberg to adapt the scenario into an operatic format, resulting in a condensed narrative that focused on the essential elements of the story.\n\n### Premiere\n\nThe Maiden in the Tower premiered on November 7, 1896, at the Finnish National Opera in Helsinki. The production featured soprano Emmy Achté as the Maiden and baritone Abraham Ojanperä as the Prince. The opera received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising Sibelius's music while others found the storyline too simplistic.\n\n### Withdrawal and suppression\n\nDespite its initial premiere, The Maiden in the Tower was withdrawn from the repertoire shortly after its debut. Sibelius himself was dissatisfied with the opera, feeling that it did not meet his artistic standards. The composer's decision to withdraw the work was likely influenced by the harsh criticism he received from some reviewers. As a result, The Maiden in the Tower remained largely forgotten for several decades.\n\n### Posthumous revival\n\nThe Maiden in the Tower experienced a posthumous revival in the 1980s, with several productions and recordings emerging in the decades that followed. The opera's revival can be attributed, in part, to a renewed interest in Sibelius's lesser-known works. Modern audiences and critics have reevaluated The Maiden in the Tower, recognizing its unique musical qualities and historical significance.\n\nStructure and Roles\n-------------------\n\nThe Maiden in the Tower is a one-act opera featuring four main characters:\n\n* The Maiden (soprano): a princess held captive in a tower by her wicked aunt\n* The Prince (baritone): the Maiden's rescuer\n* The Aunt (mezzo-soprano): the Maiden's wicked aunt and captor\n* The Herald (tenor): a messenger who announces the Prince's arrival\n\nSynopsis\n--------\n\nThe opera takes place in a single scene, set in the tower where the Maiden is being held captive. The Maiden laments her fate, singing of her longing for freedom and her desire to be reunited with her beloved Prince. The Aunt appears, taunting the Maiden and gloating over her own power.\n\nThe Herald announces the Prince's arrival, and the Maiden's hopes are raised. The Prince enters, and the Aunt attempts to thwart his rescue efforts. However, the Prince ultimately succeeds in freeing the Maiden, and the two are reunited. The opera concludes with a triumphant duet between the Maiden and the Prince.\n\nMusic\n------\n\nThe Maiden in the Tower features a unique blend of Sibelius's characteristic musical styles, including elements of folk music, Romanticism, and Impressionism. The opera's score is notable for its use of leitmotifs, with each character associated with a distinct musical theme.\n\nThe Maiden's music is characterized by soaring melodies and a sense of longing, while the Prince's music is marked by bold, heroic themes. The Aunt's music is dark and menacing, featuring low, ominous chords and a sense of malevolence. The Herald's music is brief but significant, serving as a catalyst for the events that unfold.\n\nContext and Analysis\n--------------------\n\n### The plot as allegory\n\nThe Maiden in the Tower can be interpreted as an allegory for the struggle for Finnish independence. The Maiden represents the Finnish people, held captive by the oppressive forces of Russian rule (embodied by the Aunt). The Prince represents the brave and heroic figures who fought for Finland's freedom.\n\n### Opera and Finland's language strife\n\nThe Maiden in the Tower was composed during a time of great linguistic and cultural upheaval in Finland. The opera's libretto is written in Swedish, which was the dominant language of the Finnish upper class at the time. However, the Finnish language was gaining prominence, and the opera's use of Swedish was seen as a reflection of the country's cultural and linguistic divide.\n\n### Later opinions of Sibelius's music\n\nIn the decades following its premiere, The Maiden in the Tower was often criticized for its perceived simplicity and lack of depth. However, modern critics have reevaluated the opera, recognizing its unique musical qualities and historical significance.\n\n### Reasons for post-1981 neglect\n\nDespite its posthumous revival, The Maiden in the Tower remains a relatively neglected work in Sibelius's oeuvre. The opera's neglect can be attributed to a variety of factors, including its brevity, its perceived lack of dramatic complexity, and its relatively unknown status compared to Sibelius's more famous works.\n\nDiscography\n------------\n\nThe Maiden in the Tower has been recorded several times, with notable productions including:\n\n* 1983: Finnish National Opera, conducted by Ulf Söderblom\n* 1994: Royal Swedish Opera, conducted by Leif Segerstam\n* 2003: Finnish National Opera, conducted by Mikko Franck\n\nNotes, References, and Sources\n------------------------------\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements.)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"The_Maiden_in_the_Tower\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Composition\n##Premiere\n##Withdrawal and suppression\n##Posthumous revival\n#Structure and roles\n#Synopsis\n#Music\n#Context and analysis\n##The plot as allegory\n##Opera and Finland's language strife\n##Later opinions of Sibelius's music\n##Reasons for post-1981 neglect\n#Discography\n#Notes, references, and sources\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Berejiklian's resignation came after the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) announced it would investigate her over allegations of corruption.

This was due in part to the popularity of minor parties and independents, as well as the potential for a significant swing against the Coalition government.\n\n# Campaign\n\n## Policies\n\nThe major parties released their policy platforms in the lead-up to the election.

The Greens and independents won the remaining 5 seats.\n\n# Electoral pendulums\n\n## Pre-election pendulum\n\nThe pre-election pendulum showed the Coalition government holding a majority of seats in the Legislative Assembly, with Labor needing a swing of 3.5% to win government.\n\n## Post-election pendulum\n\nThe post-election pendulum showed Labor holding a majority of seats in the Legislative Assembly, with the Coalition needing a swing of 2.5% to regain government.\n\n## Notes\n\nThe electoral pendulum is a graphical representation of the seats in the Legislative Assembly, showing the margin by which each seat was won at the previous election.\n\n# Candidates and retiring MPs\n\n## Labor\n\nA total of 93 Labor candidates contested the election, including 36 sitting MPs.

The disaster was one of the worst in Hawaii's history, with multiple islands affected and thousands of acres of land scorched.\n\n# Background\n\n## Wildfire risk\n\nHawaii is prone to wildfires due to its tropical climate, dry vegetation, and rugged terrain.

Human activities, such as land development, agriculture, and tourism, also contribute to the risk of wildfires.\n\n## Weather factors\n\nWeather conditions in Hawaii are characterized by high temperatures, low humidity, and strong winds, which create an environment conducive to wildfires. The summer months are particularly dry, with low rainfall and increased risk of lightning strikes. Weather patterns, such as trade winds and tropical cyclones, can also spread embers and sparks, fueling the spread of wildfires.\n\n# List of wildfires\n\nSeveral major wildfires burned across Hawaii in 2023, including:\n\n* Kula wildfire, Maui\n* Lahaina wildfire, Maui\n* Pūlehu-Kīhei wildfire, Maui\n* Mana Road wildfire, Hawaiʻi Island\n* Nanakuli wildfire, Oʻahu\n\n# Timeline\n\n## Maui\n\nMaui was the hardest-hit island, with multiple wildfires burning simultaneously.\n\n### Kula\n\nThe Kula wildfire started on August 8, 2023, in the Kula region of Maui.

The fire burned over 5,000 acres of land and forced the evacuation of thousands of residents.\n\n### Other fires\n\nOther wildfires burned across Maui, including the Olinda wildfire and the Makawao wildfire. These fires were smaller but still caused significant damage and disruption.\n\n## Hawaiʻi Island\n\nThe Mana Road wildfire started on August 15, 2023, on Hawaiʻi Island. The fire burned over 2,000 acres of land and forced the evacuation of several dozen residents.\n\n## Oʻahu\n\nThe Nanakuli wildfire started on August 18, 2023, on Oʻahu.

At least 10 people died, and dozens more were injured, including firefighters and civilians.\n\n## Damage\n\nThe wildfires caused widespread destruction, with hundreds of homes and businesses destroyed or damaged. The economic impact was significant, with estimated losses in the billions of dollars.\n\n## Environment\n\nThe wildfires burned thousands of acres of land, including sensitive ecosystems and wildlife habitats.

The crisis was sparked by a series of scandals and controversies surrounding Johnson's leadership, which ultimately led to a loss of confidence in his ability to govern.\n\n# Background\n\nBoris Johnson had been Prime Minister of the United Kingdom since July 2019, when he won the Conservative Party leadership election. Initially, his leadership was marked by a series of controversies, including his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and his decision to prorogue Parliament. However, he managed to maintain a strong grip on power, thanks in part to his ability to connect with voters and his success in leading the Conservative Party to a decisive victory in the 2019 general election.\n\nHowever, in 2022, a series of scandals and controversies began to erode Johnson's popularity and credibility. One of the most significant of these was the Partygate scandal, which involved allegations that Johnson and his staff had broken COVID-19 lockdown rules by holding parties in Downing Street. The scandal led to widespread outrage and calls for Johnson's resignation.\n\n# Collapse of the government\n\nThe crisis began to unfold on July 5, 2022, when Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak and Health Secretary Sajid Javid resigned from their positions, citing a loss of confidence in Johnson's leadership. The resignations were followed by a wave of other departures, including those of several junior ministers and parliamentary private secretaries.\n\n## Support for Johnson\n\nDespite the growing number of resignations, Johnson initially refused to step down, insisting that he had a mandate from the British people to continue as Prime Minister. He was supported by a number of senior ministers, including Home Secretary Priti Patel and Transport Secretary Grant Shapps.\n\nHowever, as the crisis deepened, it became increasingly clear that Johnson's position was untenable. On July 7, 2022, Johnson announced that he would resign as leader of the Conservative Party, but would remain as Prime Minister until a new leader was elected.\n\n# Resignation of Boris Johnson\n\nJohnson's resignation as Prime Minister was officially announced on September 6, 2022, when he met with King Charles III at Balmoral Castle. He was succeeded by Liz Truss, who won the Conservative Party leadership election on September 5, 2022.\n\n# Reactions\n\nThe reaction to Johnson's resignation was mixed, with some praising his decision to step down and others criticizing him for clinging to power for too long.\n\n## Domestic\n\nIn the UK, reaction to Johnson's resignation was divided along party lines. Conservative MPs and supporters generally praised Johnson's decision to step down, while Labour MPs and supporters criticized him for his handling of the crisis.\n\n## International\n\nInternationally, reaction to Johnson's resignation was also mixed. Some world leaders, such as US President Joe Biden, praised Johnson's decision to step down, while others, such as Russian President Vladimir Putin, criticized him for his handling of the crisis.\n\n# List of departures\n\nThe following is a list of some of the most notable departures from the UK government during the July 2022 crisis:\n\n* Rishi Sunak, Chancellor of the Exchequer\n* Sajid Javid, Health Secretary\n* Lord Frost, Minister of State for Brexit Opportunities and Government Efficiency\n* Will Quince, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Children and Families\n* Robin Walker, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland\n* Laura Trott, Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Chancellor of the Exchequer\n* Jonathan Gullis, Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland\n\n# See also\n\n* Premiership of Boris Johnson\n* Conservative Party leadership election, 2022\n* Partygate scandal\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a factual account of the July 2022 United Kingdom government crisis.

On June 6, 2023, the dam was destroyed, causing widespread flooding, damage to surrounding infrastructure, and significant impacts on the environment, agriculture, and local communities. This article provides an overview of the background, destruction, and aftermath of the Kakhovka Dam's destruction.\n\n#Background\n\nThe Kakhovka Dam was constructed in 1950 on the Dnieper River, approximately 30 kilometers (19 miles) east of the city of Kherson. The dam was part of the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Plant, which had a capacity of 351 megawatts. The dam's reservoir, Lake Kakhovka, was created to supply water for irrigation, drinking water, and hydroelectric power generation. The dam was also used for flood control and navigation.\n\n#Destruction\n\nOn June 6, 2023, at approximately 02:00 AM local time, the Kakhovka Dam was destroyed, releasing a massive amount of water into the Dnieper River. The exact cause of the destruction is disputed, but it is believed to have been the result of a combination of factors, including shelling and sabotage.\n\n#Responsibility\n\nThe responsibility for the destruction of the Kakhovka Dam is disputed between Ukraine and Russia. Ukraine has accused Russia of deliberately targeting the dam, while Russia has denied any involvement and blamed Ukraine for the destruction. The Ukrainian government has stated that the dam was destroyed by Russian shelling, while the Russian government has claimed that the dam was destroyed by Ukrainian forces in an attempt to flood the surrounding area and prevent Russian advances.\n\n#Effects\n\nThe destruction of the Kakhovka Dam had significant effects on the surrounding area, including:\n\n##Casualties\n\nThe exact number of casualties caused by the destruction of the Kakhovka Dam is unknown, but it is reported that several people were killed or injured in the immediate aftermath of the disaster.\n\n##Flooding and evacuations\n\nThe destruction of the dam caused widespread flooding in the surrounding area, with waters rising to as high as 7 meters (23 feet) in some areas. Thousands of people were evacuated from the affected areas, with many more left stranded or without access to basic necessities.\n\n##Animals and environment\n\nThe destruction of the dam also had significant impacts on the local environment and wildlife. The flooding caused by the dam's destruction affected several nature reserves and wildlife sanctuaries, including the Black Sea Biosphere Reserve. Many animals, including birds and fish, were killed or displaced by the flooding.\n\n##Military impact\n\nThe destruction of the Kakhovka Dam also had significant military implications. The dam's destruction disrupted the supply of water to Ukrainian forces in the region, making it more difficult for them to maintain their positions. The flooding caused by the dam's destruction also made it more difficult for Ukrainian forces to move troops and equipment in the region.\n\n##Water supply\n\nThe destruction of the Kakhovka Dam disrupted the supply of water to several cities and towns in the region, including Kherson and Nova Kakhovka. The dam's destruction also affected the supply of water for irrigation, with many farmers in the region left without access to the water they needed to grow their crops.\n\n##North Crimean Canal\n\nThe destruction of the Kakhovka Dam also affected the North Crimean Canal, which was built to supply water from the Dnieper River to the Crimean Peninsula. The canal was closed due to the flooding caused by the dam's destruction, leaving many communities on the Crimean Peninsula without access to fresh water.\n\n##Farming\n\nThe destruction of the Kakhovka Dam also had significant impacts on farming in the region. Many farmers in the region were left without access to the water they needed to grow their crops, and the flooding caused by the dam's destruction damaged or destroyed many crops.\n\n##Fisheries\n\nThe destruction of the Kakhovka Dam also affected the fisheries in the region. The flooding caused by the dam's destruction affected several fish farms and fisheries, with many fish killed or displaced by the flooding.\n\n##Energy\n\nThe destruction of the Kakhovka Dam also affected the supply of energy in the region. The dam's destruction disrupted the supply of electricity to several cities and towns in the region, with many communities left without access to electricity.\n\n##Costs of reconstruction\n\nThe costs of reconstructing the Kakhovka Dam are estimated to be in the billions of dollars. The Ukrainian government has stated that it will need significant international assistance to rebuild the dam and restore the affected areas.\n\n#Legal responses\n\nThe destruction of the Kakhovka Dam has led to several legal responses, including:\n\n* The Ukrainian government has filed a complaint with the International Court of Justice, accusing Russia of deliberately targeting the dam and causing significant harm to Ukraine.\n* The Russian government has denied any involvement in the destruction of the dam and has accused Ukraine of fabricating evidence.\n\n#Reactions\n\nThe destruction of the Kakhovka Dam has led to significant reactions from governments and international organizations around the world.\n\n##Ukrainian reactions\n\nThe Ukrainian government has condemned the destruction of the Kakhovka Dam, calling it a \"war crime\" and a \"deliberate attempt to cause harm to Ukraine.\" The Ukrainian government has also called for international assistance to rebuild the dam and restore the affected areas.\n\n##Russian reactions\n\nThe Russian government has denied any involvement in the destruction of the Kakhovka Dam, calling it a \"provocation\" by Ukraine. The Russian government has also accused Ukraine of fabricating evidence and trying to blame Russia for the destruction of the dam.\n\n##International reactions\n\nThe international community has condemned the destruction of the Kakhovka Dam, with many governments and international organizations calling for an investigation into the cause of the destruction. The United Nations has called for a ceasefire in the region and for both sides to work towards a peaceful resolution.\n\n#Aftermath\n\nThe destruction of the Kakhovka Dam has had significant and far-reaching consequences for Ukraine, Russia, and the international community. The incident has highlighted the need for a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Ukraine and for international cooperation to address the humanitarian and environmental impacts of the destruction.\n\n#See also\n\n##Similar international events\n\n* Destruction of the Mosul Dam\n* Destruction of the Tabqa Dam\n* Destruction of the Suleimaniyah Dam\n\n##General\n\n* Water security\n* Environmental security\n* Humanitarian law\n* International humanitarian law\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is a general overview of the destruction of the Kakhovka Dam and its aftermath.

This characteristic distinguishes eukaryotes from prokaryotes, which lack a true nucleus. Eukaryotes are incredibly diverse, ranging from single-celled organisms such as amoebas and paramecia, to complex multicellular organisms like plants, animals, and fungi.\n\n# Diversity\n\nEukaryotes exhibit a vast range of morphological, physiological, and ecological diversity. They can be found in almost every habitat on Earth, from the freezing tundra to the hottest deserts, and from the deepest oceans to the highest mountains. Eukaryotes can be autotrophic, obtaining their energy from sunlight, or heterotrophic, obtaining their energy from consuming other organisms. They can be sessile or mobile, and can exhibit a wide range of body forms, from simple spherical cells to complex multicellular organisms with specialized tissues and organs.\n\nSome examples of eukaryotic organisms include:\n\n* Protists: a group of single-celled eukaryotes that do not fit into any of the other eukaryotic categories. Examples include amoebas, paramecia, and giardia.\n* Fungi: a group of eukaryotes that obtain their energy by decomposing organic matter or by forming symbiotic relationships with other organisms. Examples include mushrooms, molds, and yeasts.\n* Plants: a group of eukaryotes that obtain their energy from sunlight through photosynthesis. Examples include trees, flowers, and crops.\n* Animals: a group of eukaryotes that obtain their energy by consuming other organisms. Examples include humans, insects, and fish.\n\n# Distinguishing features\n\nEukaryotes possess a number of distinguishing features that set them apart from prokaryotes.\n\n## Nucleus\n\nThe most distinctive feature of eukaryotic cells is the presence of a true nucleus, which is a membrane-bound organelle that houses the cell's genetic material. The nucleus is surrounded by a double membrane called the nuclear envelope, which is perforated by nuclear pores that allow for the passage of molecules in and out of the nucleus. The nucleus contains the majority of the cell's genetic material, which is organized into chromosomes.\n\n## Biochemistry\n\nEukaryotes exhibit a number of biochemical differences from prokaryotes. For example, eukaryotes have a different type of cell membrane that is composed of a phospholipid bilayer with embedded proteins. Eukaryotes also have a different type of metabolism, with a greater reliance on aerobic respiration and the use of mitochondria to generate energy.\n\n## Internal membranes\n\nEukaryotes have a number of internal membranes that are used to compartmentalize different cellular functions. These membranes include the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus, and lysosomes. The endoplasmic reticulum is a network of membranous tubules that is used for protein synthesis and transport. The Golgi apparatus is a complex of flattened membranous sacs that is used for protein modification and secretion. Lysosomes are membrane-bound organelles that contain digestive enzymes and are used for cellular digestion and recycling.\n\n## Mitochondria\n\nMitochondria are membrane-bound organelles that are found in the cells of most eukaryotes. They are used to generate energy for the cell through the process of cellular respiration. Mitochondria have their own DNA and are thought to have evolved from a group of bacteria that were engulfed by the cells of early eukaryotes.\n\n## Plastids\n\nPlastids are membrane-bound organelles that are found in the cells of plants and some protists. They are used for photosynthesis and are thought to have evolved from a group of cyanobacteria that were engulfed by the cells of early eukaryotes.\n\n## Cytoskeletal structures\n\nEukaryotes have a number of cytoskeletal structures that are used to provide mechanical support and shape to the cell. These structures include microtubules, microfilaments, and intermediate filaments. Microtubules are hollow tubes that are composed of tubulin proteins and are used for a variety of functions, including the separation of chromosomes during cell division. Microfilaments are thin filaments that are composed of actin proteins and are used for muscle contraction and cell movement. Intermediate filaments are a type of cytoskeletal structure that is found in the cells of animals and are used to provide mechanical support and shape to the cell.\n\n## Cell wall\n\nSome eukaryotes, such as plants and fungi, have a cell wall that is used to provide mechanical support and protection to the cell. The cell wall is composed of a variety of materials, including cellulose, chitin, and pectin.\n\n## Sexual reproduction\n\nMany eukaryotes reproduce sexually, which involves the fusion of male and female gametes to form a zygote. This process allows for the mixing of genetic material and increases genetic diversity.\n\n# Evolution\n\nThe evolution of eukaryotes is a complex and still somewhat mysterious process.\n\n## History of classification\n\nThe classification of eukaryotes has undergone significant changes over the years. Early classifications were based on morphological characteristics, but more recent classifications have been based on molecular phylogenetics. The most widely accepted classification is the six-kingdom system, which divides eukaryotes into the kingdoms Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Protista, Chromista, and Monera.\n\n## Phylogeny\n\nPhylogenetic analysis has revealed that eukaryotes are a monophyletic group, meaning that they share a common ancestor. The relationships between different groups of eukaryotes are still somewhat unclear, but most studies suggest that the earliest eukaryotes were single-celled organisms that lived over a billion years ago.\n\n## Origin of eukaryotes\n\nThe origin of eukaryotes is thought to have occurred through a process called endosymbiosis, in which one cell engulfs another cell and the engulfed cell becomes an organelle. This process is thought to have occurred multiple times, resulting in the formation of different organelles such as mitochondria and plastids.\n\n## Fossils\n\nFossil evidence of early eukaryotes is scarce, but there are a number of fossils that are thought to be eukaryotic in origin. These include fossils of ancient algae and fungi, as well as fossils of early animals such as sponges and cnidarians.\n\n# See also\n\n* Prokaryote\n* Protist\n* Fungi\n* Plant\n* Animal\n* Endosymbiotic theory\n* Mitochondrion\n* Plastid\n* Cytoskeleton\n\n# References\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank as per the requirements)\n\n# External links\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank as per the requirements)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Eukaryote\" following this outline:\n\n#Diversity\n#Distinguishing features\n##Nucleus\n##Biochemistry\n##Internal membranes\n##Mitochondria\n##Plastids\n##Cytoskeletal structures\n##Cell wall\n##Sexual reproduction\n#Evolution\n##History of classification\n##Phylogeny\n##Origin of eukaryotes\n##Fossils\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The movie follows the story of a troubled individual, Saul, as he navigates a series of eerie and unsettling events that challenge his perceptions of the world around him.\n\n#Plot\n\nThe film opens with Saul, a reclusive and introverted individual, living a mundane life in a small, isolated town. He spends most of his days working as a janitor at a local hospital, where he becomes fascinated with the patients and their stories. One day, Saul discovers a mysterious room in the hospital's basement, which appears to be locked and unused. His curiosity piqued, Saul begins to sneak into the room, where he finds a series of cryptic messages and strange symbols etched into the walls.\n\nAs Saul delves deeper into the mystery of the room, he starts to experience strange and unexplained events. He begins to question his own sanity and the reality of the world around him. The lines between reality and fantasy become increasingly blurred, and Saul finds himself trapped in a labyrinth of his own making.\n\nAs the story unfolds, Saul's grip on reality begins to slip further and further. He becomes convinced that someone or something is manipulating him, forcing him to confront the darkest corners of his own mind. In a desperate bid to regain control, Saul embarks on a perilous journey into the heart of the mystery, where he must confront the truth about himself and the world around him.\n\n#Production\n\n##Development\n\nThe idea for Saul Gone was first conceived by the film's writer and director, who were inspired by the works of psychological thriller masters such as David Lynch and Stanley Kubrick. The script was developed over several years, with the filmmakers pouring over drafts and revisions to create a narrative that was both complex and deeply unsettling.\n\n##Casting\n\nThe role of Saul was played by a relatively unknown actor, who was chosen for his ability to convey a sense of vulnerability and intensity. The supporting cast was composed of a mix of established actors and newcomers, each of whom brought their own unique energy to the film.\n\n##Writing\n\nThe script for Saul Gone was written in a highly stylized and atmospheric manner, with a focus on creating a sense of unease and tension.

He held various high-ranking positions, including Metropolitan of Bukovina and Exarch of Transnistria, and was involved in several key events that shaped the church's history.\n\n#Early life and monastic career\n\nVisarion Puiu was born on January 6, 1879, in the village of Văleni, Vaslui County, Romania. He came from a family of modest means and was the youngest of five children. From an early age, Puiu demonstrated a strong interest in spirituality and the Orthodox faith. He attended the Theological Seminary in Iași, where he studied theology and philosophy.\n\nIn 1900, Puiu was tonsured as a monk at the Neamț Monastery, one of the most important monastic centers in Romania. He took the monastic name Visarion and quickly rose through the ranks, becoming a hierodeacon in 1902 and a hieromonk in 1905. During this period, Puiu continued his theological studies, earning a doctorate in theology from the University of Bucharest in 1909.\n\n#Metropolitan of Bukovina\n\nIn 1918, Visarion Puiu was elected Metropolitan of Bukovina, a position that gave him jurisdiction over the Romanian Orthodox Church in the region of Bukovina. At the time, Bukovina was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, but it had a significant Romanian population. Puiu worked tirelessly to promote the interests of the Romanian Orthodox Church in the region, establishing new parishes and monasteries, and supporting the development of Romanian-language education and culture.\n\nDuring his tenure as Metropolitan of Bukovina, Puiu also played a key role in the unification of the Romanian Orthodox Church. In 1925, he participated in the synod that united the Romanian Orthodox Church under a single patriarch, Miron Cristea. Puiu's efforts to promote unity and cooperation within the church earned him widespread recognition and respect.\n\n#Exarch of Transnistria\n\nIn 1938, Visarion Puiu was appointed Exarch of Transnistria, a position that gave him jurisdiction over the Romanian Orthodox Church in the region of Transnistria. Transnistria was a disputed territory that had been annexed by Romania in 1918, and it had a complex history of conflict and tension.\n\nAs Exarch of Transnistria, Puiu worked to promote the interests of the Romanian Orthodox Church in the region, establishing new parishes and monasteries, and supporting the development of Romanian-language education and culture. However, his tenure was marked by controversy and conflict, particularly with regard to the treatment of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church in the region.\n\n##Voyage to Croatia and exile in Nazi Germany\n\nIn 1941, Visarion Puiu traveled to Croatia, where he met with the Croatian Orthodox Church and discussed the possibility of establishing a Croatian Orthodox patriarchate. However, his trip was cut short when he was arrested by the Gestapo and imprisoned in Zagreb.\n\nAfter several months in prison, Puiu was released and allowed to travel to Germany, where he was placed under house arrest. He spent the remainder of the war in exile, living in a series of monasteries and guesthouses in southern Germany.\n\n##Exile in Italy and trial for war crimes\n\nIn 1945, Visarion Puiu traveled to Italy, where he was arrested by the Allied authorities and charged with war crimes. Puiu was accused of collaborating with the Nazi regime and of participating in the persecution of Jews and other minorities during the war.\n\nPuiu's trial was widely publicized, and it sparked a significant controversy within the Romanian Orthodox Church. Many of Puiu's supporters argued that he had been unfairly accused and that he had actually worked to protect Jews and other minorities during the war.\n\nIn 1948, Puiu was acquitted of all charges and released from prison. However, the experience had a profound impact on him, and he spent the remainder of his life in relative obscurity.\n\n##Bishop of the Romanian Orthodox Diocese of Western Europe\n\nIn 1950, Visarion Puiu was appointed Bishop of the Romanian Orthodox Diocese of Western Europe, a position that gave him jurisdiction over the Romanian Orthodox Church in Western Europe. Puiu spent the remainder of his life serving the Romanian Orthodox community in Western Europe, establishing new parishes and monasteries, and promoting the interests of the Romanian Orthodox Church.\n\n##Final years and death\n\nVisarion Puiu died on August 10, 1964, in Paris, France. He was 85 years old. Puiu's funeral was attended by a large crowd of mourners, including many prominent figures from the Romanian Orthodox Church.\n\n#Posthumous evaluation\n\nVisarion Puiu's legacy is complex and multifaceted. On the one hand, he played a significant role in the development of the Romanian Orthodox Church, particularly during the mid-20th century. He worked tirelessly to promote the interests of the church, establishing new parishes and monasteries, and supporting the development of Romanian-language education and culture.\n\nOn the other hand, Puiu's involvement in the controversy surrounding the Ukrainian Orthodox Church in Transnistria and his alleged collaboration with the Nazi regime during World War II have been the subject of significant criticism and controversy.\n\nIn recent years, there have been efforts to reevaluate Puiu's legacy and to provide a more nuanced understanding of his role in the history of the Romanian Orthodox Church. However, the debate surrounding his legacy continues, and it is likely to remain a topic of discussion for many years to come.\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is based on a range of sources, including books, articles, and archival materials. However, due to the complexity and controversy surrounding Visarion Puiu's life and legacy, it is difficult to provide a comprehensive and definitive account of his life and career.\n\n#References\n\nThis article does not include any references or citations.

He was a member of the House of Plantagenet and the sixth king of the dynasty. Edward I is often considered one of the greatest kings of the medieval period, known for his military conquests, administrative reforms, and establishment of English parliamentary institutions.\n\nEarly years, 1239–1263\n------------------------\n\n### Childhood and marriage\n\nEdward was born on 17 June 1239 at the Palace of Westminster in London, the eldest son of King Henry III and Eleanor of Provence. He was named after Edward the Confessor, the last Anglo-Saxon king of England. Edward's childhood was spent at the royal court, where he received a traditional medieval education, including training in arms and chivalry. In 1254, Edward married Eleanor of Castile, a member of the royal family of Castile, at the Monastery of Las Huelgas in Burgos, Spain.\n\n### Early ambitions\n\nFrom a young age, Edward showed a keen interest in politics and military affairs. In 1258, he was appointed to lead a group of barons who were dissatisfied with the rule of his father, King Henry III. The barons, led by Simon de Montfort, were seeking to limit the king's power and establish a more representative government. Edward's involvement with the barons led to a rift between him and his father, who saw his son as a threat to his authority.\n\nCivil war and crusades, 1264–1273\n-----------------------------------\n\n### Second Barons' War\n\nIn 1264, the barons, led by de Montfort, rebelled against King Henry III, starting the Second Barons' War. Edward, who had initially supported the barons, switched sides and joined his father's forces. The war ended with the Battle of Evesham in 1265, where Edward led the royal forces to victory, and de Montfort was killed. The war had a profound impact on Edward, who realized the importance of a strong and centralized government.\n\n### Crusade and accession\n\nIn 1269, Edward joined the Ninth Crusade, led by King Louis IX of France, to the Holy Land. The crusade was unsuccessful, but it gave Edward valuable military experience. In 1272, Edward's father, King Henry III, died, and Edward succeeded him as King of England. However, he did not return to England immediately, instead choosing to continue his journey home via Italy and France.\n\nEarly reign, 1274–1296\n-------------------------\n\n### Conquest of Wales\n\nIn 1277, Edward launched a military campaign against the Welsh, led by Prince Llywelyn ap Gruffydd. The campaign was successful, and Edward was able to establish English control over Wales. The conquest of Wales was a significant achievement for Edward, who had demonstrated his military prowess and established his authority.\n\n### Diplomacy and war on the Continent\n\nEdward's early reign was also marked by diplomatic efforts to establish peace with Scotland and France. In 1278, he signed the Treaty of Perth, which established a peace treaty with Scotland. However, the treaty was short-lived, and Edward soon found himself at war with Scotland. In 1296, Edward invaded Scotland, starting the First War of Scottish Independence.\n\n### Great Cause\n\nIn 1291, Edward was asked to adjudicate a dispute over the Scottish throne, known as the Great Cause. The dispute had arisen after the death of Alexander III of Scotland, who had left no clear heir. Edward chose John Balliol as the new King of Scotland, but the decision was unpopular with many Scots, who saw Edward as a biased judge.\n\nGovernment and law\n-------------------\n\n### Character as king\n\nEdward is often described as a strong and effective king, who was able to maintain order and stability in England. He was a skilled military leader and a shrewd politician, who was able to navigate complex diplomatic situations. However, he was also known for his temper and his willingness to use violence to achieve his goals.\n\n### Administration and the law\n\nEdward's reign saw significant administrative reforms, including the establishment of a centralized system of government and the creation of a new system of law courts. The most significant reform was the establishment of the Model Parliament in 1295, which established the principle of representation and the right of taxation.\n\n### Finances and Parliament\n\nEdward's reign was also marked by financial difficulties, including a significant increase in taxation. The increase in taxation led to tensions between the king and the nobility, who saw the taxes as a threat to their power and privilege. In response, Edward established the Model Parliament, which gave the nobility and the common people a greater say in the governance of the country.\n\n### Parliament and the expulsion of the Jews\n\nIn 1290, Edward expelled the Jews from England, citing their alleged involvement in usury and other financial crimes. The expulsion was a significant event in English history, marking the end of a long period of Jewish settlement in the country. The expulsion was also a popular move, as many English people saw the Jews as a threat to their economic interests.\n\n### Administration in Ireland\n\nEdward's reign also saw significant administrative reforms in Ireland, including the establishment of a new system of government and the creation of a new system of law courts. The most significant reform was the establishment of the Irish Parliament in 1297, which gave the Irish nobility and the common people a greater say in the governance of the country.\n\nLater reign, 1297–1307\n-------------------------\n\n### Constitutional crisis\n\nIn 1297, Edward faced a constitutional crisis, as the nobility and the common people rebelled against his rule. The crisis was sparked by a significant increase in taxation, which the nobility and the common people saw as a threat to their power and privilege. The crisis was eventually resolved, but it marked a significant turning point in Edward's reign.\n\n### Return to Scotland\n\nIn 1303, Edward launched a new military campaign against Scotland, starting the Second War of Scottish Independence. The campaign was successful, and Edward was able to establish English control over Scotland. However, the campaign was also marked by significant violence and bloodshed, including the massacre of the Scots at the Battle of Falkirk.\n\n### Death and burial\n\nEdward died on 7 July 1307 at Burgh-by-Sands in Cumberland, England. He was buried in Westminster Abbey in London, where many other English monarchs are buried. Edward's legacy is complex and multifaceted, reflecting his many achievements and failures as a king.\n\nLegacy\n--------\n\nEdward's legacy is often seen as a mixed one, reflecting his many achievements and failures as a king. He is remembered as a strong and effective king, who was able to maintain order and stability in England. However, he is also remembered for his violence and his willingness to use force to achieve his goals.\n\nFamily\n--------\n\n### First marriage\n\nEdward's first marriage was to Eleanor of Castile, a member of the royal family of Castile. The marriage was arranged by Edward's father, King Henry III, and was seen as a way of strengthening ties between England and Castile.

The election was the first to be held under the amended electoral law, which introduced changes to the voting system and the creation of a single national constituency.\n\n# Background\n\n## Amendment of the electoral law\n\nIn 2020, the Hungarian parliament amended the electoral law, introducing significant changes to the voting system. The most notable change was the creation of a single national constituency, which replaced the previous system of 19 regional constituencies and one national constituency. This change aimed to reduce the number of constituencies and create a more proportional representation system.\n\n## Creation of joint opposition list\n\nIn 2021, six opposition parties, including the Democratic Coalition, Momentum Movement, Hungarian Socialist Party, Jobbik, Dialogue – The Greens' Party, and LMP – Hungary's Green Party, formed a joint list, known as United for Hungary, to challenge the ruling Fidesz-KDNP coalition in the 2022 parliamentary election. The joint list was seen as a strategic move to increase the opposition's chances of winning the election.\n\n## Opposition primary\n\nIn 2021, the opposition parties held a primary election to select their candidates for the 2022 parliamentary election. The primary was seen as a way to increase voter engagement and select the most popular candidates. Peter Marki-Zay, the mayor of Hodmezovasarhely, won the primary and became the joint opposition candidate for prime minister.\n\n# Electoral system\n\nHungary uses a mixed electoral system, which combines elements of both proportional representation and single-member districts. The country is divided into 106 single-member districts, in which voters elect one representative using the first-past-the-post system. Additionally, there is a single national constituency, in which voters elect 93 representatives using proportional representation. The national constituency is used to allocate seats to parties based on their national vote share.\n\n# Parties and coalitions\n\nSeveral parties and coalitions participated in the 2022 parliamentary election. The main parties and coalitions were:\n\n* Fidesz-KDNP coalition, led by Viktor Orban\n* United for Hungary, led by Peter Marki-Zay\n* Our Home Movement, led by Laszlo Toroczkai\n* Solution Movement, led by Gergely Karacsony\n\n# Opinion polls\n\nOpinion polls conducted before the election showed a close contest between the Fidesz-KDNP coalition and the United for Hungary coalition. According to a poll conducted by the Publicus Institute in March 2022, the Fidesz-KDNP coalition had 44% support, while the United for Hungary coalition had 42% support.\n\n# Results\n\n## Result by constituency\n\nThe Fidesz-KDNP coalition won 87 single-member districts, while the United for Hungary coalition won 19 districts.\n\n## Party list results by county and in the diaspora\n\nThe Fidesz-KDNP coalition won the most votes in all counties, except for Budapest, which was won by the United for Hungary coalition. In the diaspora, the Fidesz-KDNP coalition won 95% of the votes.\n\n# Aftermath\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe 2022 parliamentary election was seen as a major victory for the Fidesz-KDNP coalition, which secured a fourth consecutive term in office. The election was also seen as a test of the opposition's ability to challenge the ruling party. Despite the opposition's efforts, the Fidesz-KDNP coalition was able to maintain its majority in the National Assembly.\n\n## Conduct\n\nThe election was generally seen as free and fair, although there were some concerns about the conduct of the election. The opposition parties complained about the biased media coverage and the unequal access to campaign funding.\n\n## Anomalies over postal ballots\n\nThere were some anomalies reported over postal ballots, with some voters reporting that they had not received their ballots or that their ballots had been tampered with. The election authorities investigated these allegations, but no major irregularities were found.\n\n## International responses\n\nThe international community generally welcomed the peaceful conduct of the election, although some observers expressed concerns about the electoral system and the conduct of the election. The European Union and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) sent observer missions to monitor the election.\n\n# See also\n\n* Politics of Hungary\n* List of political parties in Hungary\n* Elections in Hungary\n\n# Notes\n\n* This article is based on information available up to April 2022.\n\n# References\n\n* (Note: No references were included in this version)\n\n# External links\n\n* National Election Office of Hungary\n* Hungarian Parliament\n* European Union Election Observation Mission to Hungary\n* OSCE Election Observation Mission to Hungary", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Hungarian_parliamentary_election\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Amendment of the electoral law\n##Creation of joint opposition list\n##Opposition primary\n#Electoral system\n#Parties and coalitions\n#Opinion polls\n#Results\n##Result by constituency\n##Party list results by county and in the diaspora\n#Aftermath\n##Analysis\n##Conduct\n##Anomalies over postal ballots\n##International responses\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Open science is a movement that seeks to make scientific research and its outcomes openly available to anyone, promoting collaboration, transparency, and reproducibility. The economics of open science examines the implications of this movement on the traditional scientific publishing industry, the role of new technologies and business models, and the impact on the broader society.\n\n# Economic models\n\n## Open science club\n\n### Definitions of knowledge club\n\nA knowledge club is a theoretical concept in economics that refers to a group of individuals or organizations that share knowledge and collaborate on its production and dissemination. The knowledge club model assumes that knowledge is a public good, non-rivalrous and non-excludable, and that its production and sharing can lead to positive externalities.\n\n### Knowledge club and open science\n\nOpen science can be seen as a knowledge club, where researchers, scientists, and scholars share their knowledge and findings openly, without restrictions or proprietary claims. The open science movement is based on the idea that scientific knowledge is a public good, and that its sharing can lead to faster progress, innovation, and societal benefits.\n\n## Open Science market\n\n### Scientific publishing: a hybrid market\n\nThe scientific publishing industry is a hybrid market, where traditional subscription-based models coexist with open access models. The traditional model relies on readers paying for access to scientific articles, while the open access model relies on authors or their institutions paying for the publication of their work.\n\n### From readers to authors: hybrid and full open access\n\nThe shift from readers to authors as the primary customers of scientific publishing has led to the emergence of hybrid and full open access models. Hybrid models allow authors to choose whether to pay for open access, while full open access models require all authors to pay for publication.\n\n### From publishing to analytics: diversification of revenue streams\n\nThe scientific publishing industry is diversifying its revenue streams, moving beyond traditional publishing to analytics, data services, and other value-added products. This shift reflects the growing importance of data and analytics in scientific research and the need for publishers to adapt to changing market demands.\n\n## Open Science Commons\n\n### The emergence of digital knowledge commons\n\nThe internet and digital technologies have enabled the emergence of digital knowledge commons, where individuals and organizations can share and collaborate on knowledge production and dissemination. Open science platforms, repositories, and social networks are examples of digital knowledge commons.\n\n### Enclosures of open science commons\n\nHowever, the open science commons are facing enclosures, as commercial interests and proprietary claims seek to restrict access to scientific knowledge. This can lead to the fragmentation of the open science ecosystem and undermine its potential benefits.\n\n### Consolidation of the common ecosystem (2015-)\n\nSince 2015, there has been a consolidation of the open science ecosystem, with the emergence of new platforms, services, and business models. This consolidation reflects the growing recognition of open science as a key driver of innovation and societal progress.\n\n# Cost\n\n## Editorial work and evaluation\n\nOpen science models require significant investments in editorial work and evaluation, to ensure the quality and validity of scientific research. These costs can be borne by authors, institutions, or publishers, and can vary depending on the specific model.\n\n## Technical infrastructure\n\nThe technical infrastructure required to support open science platforms and services can be significant, including costs for servers, storage, and maintenance. These costs can be borne by publishers, institutions, or governments, and can vary depending on the specific model.\n\n## Commercial services and prestige\n\nCommercial services and prestige can also play a role in the cost of open science, as authors and institutions seek to publish in high-impact journals or use premium services. These costs can be borne by authors, institutions, or publishers, and can vary depending on the specific model.\n\n# Benefits\n\n## Transaction costs\n\nOpen science models can reduce transaction costs, as researchers and scientists can share and access knowledge more easily and quickly. This can lead to faster progress and innovation, as well as increased collaboration and cooperation.\n\n## Access costs\n\nOpen science models can also reduce access costs, as researchers and scientists can access knowledge and research findings without restrictions or proprietary claims. This can lead to increased equity and inclusion, as well as improved outcomes for marginalized or disadvantaged groups.\n\n## Research efficiency\n\nOpen science models can improve research efficiency, as researchers and scientists can build on existing knowledge and findings more easily and quickly. This can lead to faster progress and innovation, as well as increased productivity and impact.\n\n## Economic and social development\n\nOpen science models can also contribute to economic and social development, as scientific knowledge and research findings are shared and used to address societal challenges and improve outcomes. This can lead to increased economic growth, improved health outcomes, and enhanced social well-being.\n\n# Economic regulation of open science\n\nEconomic regulation of open science is necessary to ensure that the benefits of open science are realized, while minimizing the risks and challenges. This can involve government policies and regulations, as well as industry self-regulation and standards.\n\n# References\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Economics_of_open_science\" following this outline:\n\n#Economic models\n##Open science club\n###Definitions of knowledge club\n###Knowledge club and open science\n##Open Science market\n###Scientific publishing: a hybrid market\n###From readers to authors: hybrid and full open access\n###From publishing to analytics: diversification of revenue streams\n##Open Science Commons\n###The emergence of digital knowledge commons\n###Enclosures of open science commons\n###Consolidation of the common ecosystem (2015-)\n#Cost\n##Editorial work and evaluation\n##Technical infrastructure\n##Commercial services and prestige\n#Benefits\n##Transaction costs\n##Access costs\n##Research efficiency\n##Economic and social development\n#Economic regulation of open science\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Through his popular Telegram channel, Tatarsky provided detailed and often graphic accounts of the war, which earned him a significant following and made him a prominent figure in Russian online discourse.\n\nPrison and War\n--------------\n\nTatarsky's life before his rise to fame as a military correspondent is shrouded in mystery. However, it is reported that he spent several years in prison for robbery. During his time in prison, Tatarsky became acquainted with other inmates who had fought in various conflicts, including the Yugoslav Wars and the War in Donbass. These encounters had a profound impact on Tatarsky, who developed a fascination with the experiences of soldiers and the realities of war.\n\nFollowing his release from prison, Tatarsky began to travel to conflict zones, where he documented the lives of soldiers and the effects of war on local populations. His experiences during this period laid the groundwork for his later work as a military correspondent.\n\nTelegram Channel\n----------------\n\nTatarsky's rise to prominence began with the creation of his Telegram channel, which he used to share his observations and insights on the Russian-Ukrainian conflict. Through his channel, Tatarsky provided detailed and often graphic accounts of the war, which included descriptions of battles, interviews with soldiers, and analysis of military strategy.\n\nTatarsky's Telegram channel quickly gained a large following, and his posts were widely shared and discussed on Russian social media. His writing style, which blended vivid descriptions of war with wry humor and insightful analysis, resonated with many readers and helped to establish him as a prominent voice on the Russian online scene.\n\nAssassination\n-------------\n\nOn April 2, 2023, Tatarsky was assassinated in a bombing at a St. Petersburg cafe. The attack, which was reportedly carried out by a Ukrainian nationalist group, also injured several other people.\n\nTatarsky's assassination sent shockwaves through the Russian online community, with many of his followers and fellow bloggers expressing outrage and grief at his death. The Russian government condemned the attack, and authorities launched an investigation into the circumstances surrounding Tatarsky's death.\n\nLegacy\n--------\n\nVladlen Tatarsky's legacy is complex and multifaceted. Through his Telegram channel, he provided a unique and unvarnished perspective on the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, which helped to humanize the experiences of soldiers and civilians affected by the war.\n\nTatarsky's writing style, which blended vivid descriptions of war with wry humor and insightful analysis, influenced a generation of Russian bloggers and military correspondents. His willingness to take risks and challenge conventional wisdom helped to establish him as a prominent voice on the Russian online scene.\n\nHowever, Tatarsky's legacy is also marked by controversy. Some critics accused him of promoting a pro-Russian agenda and glorifying violence. Others raised concerns about the accuracy and reliability of his reporting, which often relied on unverified sources and anecdotal evidence.\n\nSee Also\n--------\n\n* Russian-Ukrainian conflict\n* War in Donbass\n* Telegram (software)\n* Russian nationalism\n* Ukrainian nationalism\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nThis article is based on publicly available information and does not include any classified or proprietary material.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nThis article does not include any references or citations.\n\nExternal Links\n---------------\n\n* Vladlen Tatarsky's Telegram channel (archived)\n* Russian Ministry of Defense statement on Tatarsky's assassination\n* Ukrainian Nationalist Group claims responsibility for Tatarsky's assassination", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Vladlen_Tatarsky\" following this outline:\n\n#Prison and war\n#Telegram channel\n#Assassination\n#Legacy\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Koufax is widely regarded as one of the greatest pitchers in baseball history, known for his blazing fastball, sharp curveball, and remarkable control. During his playing career, Koufax set numerous records, won numerous awards, and became a cultural icon, particularly within the Jewish community.\n\nEarly life\n\nKoufax was born on December 30, 1935, in Brooklyn, New York, to Jewish parents, Evelyn and Jack Koufax. He grew up in the borough of Bensonhurst, where he developed a passion for sports, particularly baseball. Koufax's father, a successful garment industry businessman, encouraged his son's interest in sports, and Sandy began playing baseball at a young age.\n\nKoufax attended Lafayette High School in Brooklyn, where he played baseball, basketball, and football. He was an exceptional athlete, and his baseball skills caught the attention of local scouts. In 1953, Koufax was signed by the Brooklyn Dodgers as an amateur free agent.\n\nMajor League tryouts\n\nBefore joining the Dodgers, Koufax attended the University of Cincinnati on a basketball scholarship. However, he left college after one year to pursue a career in baseball. In 1954, Koufax reported to the Dodgers' minor league affiliate in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, where he began his professional baseball career.\n\nProfessional career\n\nEarly years (1955–1960)\n\nKoufax made his major league debut on June 24, 1955, for the Brooklyn Dodgers. He pitched 2/3 of an inning, allowing a run on two hits. Koufax spent the next several seasons shuttling between the Dodgers and their minor league affiliates. In 1957, he was recalled to the Dodgers and became a regular member of the team's pitching staff.\n\nDuring his early years with the Dodgers, Koufax struggled to find consistency. He had a high strikeout rate, but he also walked many batters, which led to high pitch counts and early exits from games. Despite these challenges, Koufax showed flashes of brilliance, including a 14-strikeout performance against the Chicago Cubs in 1959.\n\nDomination (1961–1964)\n\n1961 season\n\nIn 1961, Koufax's career took a dramatic turn. He began working with Dodgers pitching coach, Joe Becker, who helped him refine his mechanics and develop a more effective curveball. Koufax's hard work paid off, as he posted a 18-13 record with a 3.52 ERA and 269 strikeouts.\n\n1962 season\n\nIn 1962, Koufax continued to dominate opposing hitters. He went 14-7 with a 2.54 ERA and 216 strikeouts. Koufax's performance earned him a spot on the National League All-Star team, and he was named the National League's Pitcher of the Month for June.\n\n1963 season\n\nKoufax's 1963 season was arguably his best to date. He went 25-5 with a 1.88 ERA and 306 strikeouts. Koufax's performance earned him the National League's Cy Young Award and the Most Valuable Player award.\n\nSalary dispute\n\n1964 season\n\nIn 1964, Koufax and teammate Don Drysdale engaged in a highly publicized salary dispute with the Dodgers. The two pitchers, who were among the highest-paid players in baseball, sought significant raises. The dispute led to a holdout, which lasted for several weeks. Eventually, Koufax and Drysdale signed contracts, but the dispute had a lasting impact on the relationship between the players and the team's management.\n\nPlaying in pain (1965–66)\n\n1965 season\n\nIn 1965, Koufax pitched in pain for much of the season. He had developed a severe case of arthritis in his left elbow, which made it difficult for him to throw. Despite the pain, Koufax continued to pitch, and he posted a 26-8 record with a 1.73 ERA and 382 strikeouts.\n\nPerfection\n\nOn September 9, 1965, Koufax pitched a perfect game against the Chicago Cubs. The game was Koufax's fourth no-hitter, and it capped off an incredible season.\n\nWorld Series and Yom Kippur decision\n\nIn the 1965 World Series, Koufax faced a difficult decision. Game 1 of the series fell on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish year. Koufax, who was an observant Jew, decided not to pitch on Yom Kippur, citing his religious obligations. The decision was widely respected, and it cemented Koufax's status as a cultural icon within the Jewish community.\n\nHoldout\n\n1966 season\n\nIn 1966, Koufax and Drysdale engaged in another salary dispute with the Dodgers. The two pitchers sought significant raises, but the team refused to meet their demands. The dispute led to a holdout, which lasted for several weeks. Eventually, Koufax and Drysdale signed contracts, but the dispute marked the beginning of the end of Koufax's career with the Dodgers.\n\nRetirement\n\nIn November 1966, Koufax announced his retirement from baseball. He was just 30 years old, but the chronic pain in his left elbow had become too much to bear. Koufax's retirement was a shock to the baseball world, but it marked the end of an incredible career.\n\nCareer overall\n\nStatistics and achievements\n\nKoufax's career statistics are impressive. He won 165 games, lost 87, and posted a 2.76 ERA. Koufax also struck out 2,396 batters, which was a National League record at the time of his retirement. Koufax was a three-time Cy Young Award winner and was named the National League's Most Valuable Player in 1963.\n\nPitching style and repertoire\n\nKoufax was a power pitcher with a blazing fastball and a sharp curveball. He also had a effective changeup, which he used to keep hitters off balance. Koufax's pitching style was characterized by his high strikeout rate and his ability to dominate opposing hitters.\n\nPost-playing activities\n\nAfter his retirement, Koufax went on to become a successful businessman and entrepreneur. He invested in several companies, including a chain of sporting goods stores and a restaurant. Koufax also worked as a baseball broadcaster, providing color commentary for NBC and ABC.\n\nHonors and recognition\n\nKoufax has received numerous honors and accolades for his contributions to baseball. He was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1972, and his number 32 jersey was retired by the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1972.\n\nLegacy\n\nImpact within the Jewish community\n\nKoufax's legacy extends far beyond the baseball diamond. He is widely regarded as a cultural icon within the Jewish community, and his decision not to pitch on Yom Kippur in 1965 is still remembered and respected today. Koufax's commitment to his faith and his community has inspired countless young people, and he remains a beloved figure within the Jewish community.\n\nRelationship with fellow minorities\n\nKoufax's legacy also extends to his relationships with fellow minorities. He was a close friend and supporter of Jackie Robinson, the first African American player in Major League Baseball. Koufax also worked to promote greater understanding and acceptance between different racial and ethnic groups, and he remains a respected figure within the African American community.\n\nIn media culture\n\nTelevision appearances\n\nKoufax has made numerous television appearances over the years, including several guest spots on popular sitcoms and dramas. He has also worked as a baseball broadcaster, providing color commentary for NBC and ABC.\n\nCultural references\n\nKoufax has been referenced in numerous cultural works, including films, television shows, and books. He remains a beloved figure in popular culture, and his legacy continues to inspire new generations of baseball fans and non-fans alike.\n\nPersonal life\n\nKoufax has been married twice, first to Anne Widmark from 1969 to 1982, and then to Kim Widmark from 1985 to present. He has two daughters, Kelly and Jane.\n\nSee also\n\n* List of Major League Baseball career strikeout leaders\n* List of Major League Baseball career wins leaders\n* List of Major League Baseball perfect games\n* List of Major League Baseball no-hitters\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nBook sources\n\nFurther reading\n\nArticles\n\n* \"Sandy Koufax: The Left Arm of God\" by Jane Leavy\n* \"Koufax: A Lefty's Legacy\" by Sandy Koufax and Ed Gruver\n\nBooks\n\n* \"Sandy Koufax: A Biography\" by Jane Leavy\n* \"Koufax\" by Sandy Koufax and Ed Gruver\n\nExternal links\n\n* Sandy Koufax at the Baseball Hall of Fame\n* Sandy Koufax at the Internet Movie Database\n* Sandy Koufax at the Baseball-Reference.com", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Sandy_Koufax\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n##Major League tryouts\n#Professional career\n##Early years (1955–1960)\n##Domination (1961–1964)\n###1961 season\n###1962 season\n###1963 season\n##Salary dispute\n###1964 season\n##Playing in pain (1965–66)\n###1965 season\n####Perfection\n####World Series and Yom Kippur decision\n##Holdout\n###1966 season\n##Retirement\n#Career overall\n##Statistics and achievements\n##Pitching style and repertoire\n#Post-playing activities\n#Honors and recognition\n#Legacy\n##Impact within the Jewish community\n##Relationship with fellow minorities\n#In media culture\n##Television appearances\n##Cultural references\n#Personal life\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n##Book sources\n#Further reading\n##Articles\n##Books\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The storm complex was a result of a strong low-pressure system that developed over the southern United States and moved northward, interacting with a cold front and a dry line. This article provides an overview of the meteorological synopsis, confirmed tornadoes, non-tornadic effects, and impact of the storm complex.\n\n# Meteorological Synopsis\n\nThe April 2022 North American storm complex was a result of a strong low-pressure system that developed over the southern United States on April 10, 2022. The system intensified as it moved northward, interacting with a cold front and a dry line. The interaction between the low-pressure system and the cold front led to the development of a strong jet stream, which provided the necessary lift for severe thunderstorms to develop. The dry line, which separated the dry air from the Gulf of Mexico from the moist air from the Atlantic Ocean, played a crucial role in the development of the severe weather event.\n\nAs the low-pressure system moved northward, it brought warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico into the region, creating a highly unstable atmosphere. The combination of the strong jet stream and the unstable atmosphere led to the development of severe thunderstorms, including supercells, which are capable of producing tornadoes.\n\n# Confirmed Tornadoes\n\nThe April 2022 North American storm complex produced a significant number of tornadoes across the central and southern United States.\n\n## April 11 Event\n\nOn April 11, 2022, a total of 17 tornadoes were reported across the states of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Missouri. The strongest tornado of the day was an EF2 tornado that occurred in the city of Wichita Falls, Texas, causing significant damage to homes and businesses.\n\n## April 12 Event\n\nOn April 12, 2022, a total of 25 tornadoes were reported across the states of Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. The strongest tornado of the day was an EF3 tornado that occurred in the city of Monroe, Louisiana, causing significant damage to homes and businesses.\n\n## April 13 Event\n\nOn April 13, 2022, a total of 15 tornadoes were reported across the states of Tennessee, Kentucky, and North Carolina. The strongest tornado of the day was an EF2 tornado that occurred in the city of Nashville, Tennessee, causing significant damage to homes and businesses.\n\n## Bell County–Salado, Texas\n\nOn April 12, 2022, a long-lived supercell produced a tornado that affected the counties of Bell and Salado, Texas. The tornado was classified as an EF3 and caused significant damage to homes and businesses.\n\n# Non-Tornadic Effects\n\nIn addition to the tornadoes, the April 2022 North American storm complex produced a wide range of non-tornadic effects, including severe storms and winter weather.\n\n## Severe Storms\n\nThe storm complex produced a significant number of severe storms across the central and southern United States. The storms produced large hail, damaging winds, and heavy rainfall, leading to flash flooding in some areas.\n\n## Winter Weather Side\n\nThe storm complex also produced winter weather conditions across the northern United States. A cold front associated with the low-pressure system brought cold air into the region, leading to freezing temperatures and snowfall.\n\n### Freezing Temperatures\n\nFreezing temperatures were reported across the states of Montana, North Dakota, and Minnesota, leading to the formation of black ice on roads and highways.\n\n### Blizzard\n\nA blizzard was reported in the state of South Dakota, with sustained winds of up to 40 mph and heavy snowfall. The blizzard led to the closure of roads and highways, and made travel hazardous.\n\n# Impact\n\nThe April 2022 North American storm complex had a significant impact on the central and southern United States. The tornadoes and severe storms caused significant damage to homes and businesses, and led to power outages and flash flooding. The winter weather conditions also had a significant impact, leading to the closure of roads and highways, and making travel hazardous.\n\n# See Also\n\n* List of tornadoes in the United States\n* List of severe weather events in the United States\n* Winter storm\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a comprehensive overview of the April 2022 North American storm complex.
