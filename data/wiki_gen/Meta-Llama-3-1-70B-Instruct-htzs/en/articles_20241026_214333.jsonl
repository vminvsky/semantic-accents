The Moskva, a Slava-class cruiser, was the flagship of the Russian Black Sea Fleet and one of the most powerful warships in the Russian Navy. The incident was widely reported and had significant implications for the ongoing conflict.\n\n#Background\n\nThe Moskva was commissioned in 1983 and was designed to provide air defense and anti-submarine capabilities to the Soviet Navy. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the ship was inherited by the Russian Navy and underwent several modernization programs. At the time of the incident, the Moskva was the flagship of the Russian Black Sea Fleet and was participating in the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn the days leading up to the incident, the Moskva had been involved in several operations, including the blockade of Ukrainian ports and the provision of gunfire support to Russian ground troops. The ship was also equipped with a range of advanced sensors and communication systems, making it a key asset for the Russian military.\n\n#Sinking\n\n##Ukrainian account\n\nAccording to the Ukrainian military, the Moskva was struck by two Neptune anti-ship missiles fired by Ukrainian forces on the evening of April 13, 2022. The missiles were reportedly launched from a location near the port city of Odesa, and the Ukrainian military claimed that the ship was hit in the port side of the hull.\n\nThe Ukrainian account of the incident was supported by several eyewitnesses, who reported seeing the ship on fire and listing to one side. The Ukrainian military also released a statement claiming that the Moskva had sunk, although this was not immediately confirmed by Russian officials.\n\n##Russian account\n\nThe Russian account of the incident differed significantly from the Ukrainian version. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, the Moskva sank on April 14, 2022, after a fire broke out on board. The ministry claimed that the fire was caused by an explosion of ammunition on the ship, and that the crew had attempted to put out the blaze but were unable to do so.\n\nThe Russian account did not mention any involvement by Ukrainian forces, and instead attributed the incident to an accident. However, this explanation was met with skepticism by many observers, who pointed out that the ship had been involved in combat operations in the days leading up to the incident.\n\n##Other early observations\n\nIn the hours following the incident, several other observers reported seeing the Moskva on fire and listing to one side. These reports came from a range of sources, including satellite imagery and eyewitness accounts from ships in the area.\n\nOne of the most significant early observations came from a US defense official, who reported that the Moskva had been hit by a missile. This report was later confirmed by other sources, including the Ukrainian military.\n\n##Missile strike\n\nThe evidence suggests that the Moskva was indeed hit by a missile, likely a Neptune anti-ship missile fired by Ukrainian forces. The missile strike would have caused significant damage to the ship, including a breach of the hull and a fire that spread rapidly throughout the vessel.\n\nThe use of a Neptune missile would have been a significant escalation of the conflict, as it would have required the Ukrainian military to have acquired and deployed a sophisticated anti-ship capability. However, the Ukrainian military had been working to develop this capability in the months leading up to the incident, and it is likely that they had acquired the necessary technology and training to carry out the attack.\n\n##Images and video of the sinking ship\n\nIn the days following the incident, several images and videos of the sinking Moskva were released. These images showed the ship on fire and listing to one side, with smoke billowing from the hull.\n\nThe images and video were widely shared on social media, and provided a graphic illustration of the severity of the incident. They also helped to confirm the Ukrainian account of the incident, which had been met with skepticism by some observers.\n\n#Casualties\n\nThe exact number of casualties from the sinking of the Moskva is not known, although it is believed to be significant. The Russian military reported that one sailor had died in the incident, although this number is likely to be an underestimate.\n\nThe Ukrainian military claimed that the ship had a crew of over 500 sailors, and that many of these had been killed or injured in the incident. However, this number has not been confirmed, and it is likely that the true number of casualties will never be known.\n\n#Impact\n\nThe sinking of the Moskva had a significant impact on the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. The incident marked a major escalation of the conflict, and highlighted the growing capabilities of the Ukrainian military.\n\nThe incident also had significant implications for the Russian military, which had been relying on the Moskva as a key asset in the conflict. The loss of the ship would have reduced the Russian military's ability to project power in the region, and would have required them to reassess their strategy.\n\n#Aftermath\n\nIn the days following the incident, the Russian military launched a series of airstrikes against Ukrainian targets. These airstrikes were seen as a response to the sinking of the Moskva, and marked a further escalation of the conflict.\n\nThe incident also led to a significant increase in tensions between Russia and the West, with several countries condemning the Russian military's actions. The incident highlighted the growing risks of the conflict, and the need for a diplomatic solution to the crisis.\n\n#See also\n\n* Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* Ukrainian military\n* Russian Navy\n* Slava-class cruiser", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Sinking_of_the_Moskva\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Sinking\n##Ukrainian account\n##Russian account\n##Other early observations\n##Missile strike\n##Images and video of the sinking ship\n#Casualties\n#Impact\n#Aftermath\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It was founded in 1994 and is contested by 18 clubs. The league is operated by the Football Association of Indonesia (PSSI) and is considered one of the most popular sports leagues in the country.\n\n# History\n\n## Origins\n\nThe concept of a national football league in Indonesia dates back to the 1930s, when the country was still a Dutch colony. The first national championship was held in 1931, with teams from various regions competing in a knockout format. However, the league was not formalized until after Indonesia gained independence in 1945.\n\n## Foundation\n\nThe modern Indonesian football league was established in 1979, with the creation of the Galatama league. The Galatama was a semi-professional league that featured teams from various regions, but it was not a national league in the classical sense. In 1990, the PSSI introduced the Perserikatan league, which was a national championship featuring teams from various regions.\n\n## Dualism\n\nIn 1994, the PSSI introduced the Liga Indonesia, which was a professional league that replaced the Perserikatan. However, the Liga Indonesia was not the only top-level league in the country. The Galatama league continued to operate, and there were several other regional leagues that were not affiliated with the PSSI. This led to a period of dualism, where there were multiple top-level leagues operating in the country.\n\n## Government intervention and FIFA suspension\n\nIn 2011, the Indonesian government intervened in the league, citing concerns over the PSSI's management and corruption. The government imposed a freeze on the league, which led to a suspension by FIFA. The suspension was lifted in 2016, after the PSSI reformed its management structure and introduced new reforms.\n\n## Name change\n\nIn 2017, the league was rebranded as Liga 1, as part of a broader effort to rebrand Indonesian football. The name change was intended to make the league more attractive to sponsors and fans.\n\n# Competition format\n\n## Competition\n\nLiga 1 is a double-round robin league, where each team plays every other team twice. The team with the most points at the end of the season is crowned the champion. In the event of a tie, the team with the better goal difference is declared the winner.\n\n## Promotion and relegation\n\nLiga 1 features a system of promotion and relegation with the Liga 2, which is the second tier of Indonesian football. The bottom three teams in Liga 1 are relegated to Liga 2, while the top three teams in Liga 2 are promoted to Liga 1.\n\n## Video assistant referee\n\nIn 2019, Liga 1 introduced the video assistant referee (VAR) system, which is used to review decisions made by the referee. The VAR system is used to review goals, penalties, and direct red cards.\n\n# Clubs\n\n## Champions\n\nThe most successful club in Liga 1 is Persipura Jayapura, which has won four titles. Other successful clubs include Persija Jakarta, which has won three titles, and Arema FC, which has won two titles.\n\n## Performance by clubs\n\nThe performance of clubs in Liga 1 varies widely.

He is considered one of the most influential mathematicians of all time, and his work had a profound impact on the development of modern mathematics, physics, and astronomy.\n\nBiography\n----------\n\n### Youth and education\n\nCarl Friedrich Gauss was born on April 30, 1777, in Braunschweig, Duchy of Brunswick (now part of Germany), to a family of modest means. His father, Gebhard Dietrich Gauss, was a gardener and a bricklayer, and his mother, Dorothea Benze, was a homemaker. Gauss showed exceptional mathematical talent from an early age and was largely self-taught. He attended the local elementary school, where he impressed his teachers with his mathematical abilities.\n\nIn 1788, Gauss entered the Catharineum, a prestigious secondary school in Braunschweig, where he continued to excel in mathematics. Two years later, he entered the University of Göttingen, where he studied mathematics, physics, and philosophy. Gauss's time at Göttingen was marked by significant mathematical discoveries, including the fundamental theorem of algebra and the prime number theorem.\n\n### Private scholar\n\nAfter completing his studies at Göttingen, Gauss returned to Braunschweig and lived as a private scholar, supported by a stipend from the Duke of Brunswick. During this period, he continued to work on mathematics and astronomy, making significant contributions to both fields.\n\n### Professor in Göttingen\n\nIn 1807, Gauss was appointed as the director of the Göttingen Observatory, a position he held until his death in 1855. He was also appointed as a professor of mathematics and astronomy at the University of Göttingen, where he taught and conducted research for many years.\n\n### Gauss's brain\n\nGauss's brain was preserved after his death and studied by neurologists. It was found to have a unique structure, with a higher-than-average number of neurons and a larger-than-average cerebral cortex. This has led some researchers to speculate about the relationship between brain structure and mathematical ability.\n\n### Family\n\nGauss married Johanna Osthoff in 1805, and they had three children together. After Johanna's death in 1809, Gauss married Minna Waldeck in 1810, and they had three more children.\n\n### Personality\n\n#### Scholar\n\nGauss was known for his exceptional mathematical talent and his meticulous approach to research. He was a perfectionist and was known to be very critical of his own work. Gauss was also a prolific writer and corresponded with many prominent mathematicians and scientists of his time.\n\n#### Private man\n\nGauss was a private person and kept his personal life separate from his professional life. He was known to be quiet and reserved, preferring the company of his family and close friends to that of large social gatherings.\n\nScientific work\n---------------\n\n### Algebra and number theory\n\nGauss made significant contributions to algebra and number theory, including the fundamental theorem of algebra and the prime number theorem.\n\n#### Fundamental theorem of algebra\n\nThe fundamental theorem of algebra states that every non-constant polynomial has at least one complex root. Gauss proved this theorem in his doctoral dissertation and it has since become a cornerstone of algebra.\n\n#### Disquisitiones Arithmeticae\n\nGauss's most famous work is his book \"Disquisitiones Arithmeticae\", which was published in 1801. In this book, Gauss presents a comprehensive treatment of number theory, including the properties of integers, congruences, and Diophantine equations.\n\n#### Further investigations\n\nGauss continued to work on number theory throughout his career, making significant contributions to the study of prime numbers, modular forms, and elliptic curves.\n\n### Analysis\n\nGauss made significant contributions to analysis, including the development of the theory of functions and the study of differential equations.\n\n#### Numeric analysis\n\nGauss developed the method of least squares, which is a fundamental technique in statistics and data analysis. He also worked on the study of interpolation and approximation.\n\n### Chronology\n\nGauss's work on chronology, the study of the measurement of time, led to the development of a new system of timekeeping.\n\n### Astronomy\n\nGauss made significant contributions to astronomy, including the discovery of the planet Ceres and the calculation of the orbits of the planets.\n\n### Theory of errors\n\nGauss developed the theory of errors, which is a fundamental concept in statistics and data analysis. He showed that the mean of a large number of measurements is the best estimate of the true value.\n\n### Arc measurement and geodetic survey\n\nGauss worked on the measurement of the arc of the meridian, which led to a more accurate determination of the size and shape of the Earth.\n\n### Differential geometry\n\nGauss made significant contributions to differential geometry, including the development of the theory of curvature and the study of surfaces.\n\n### Non-Euclidean geometry\n\nGauss worked on non-Euclidean geometry, which is a branch of mathematics that deals with geometries that are different from Euclid's geometry.\n\n### Early topology\n\nGauss made significant contributions to topology, including the development of the theory of knots and the study of the properties of spaces.\n\n### Minor mathematical accomplishments\n\nGauss made many minor mathematical accomplishments, including the solution of the problem of the seven bridges of Königsberg and the study of the properties of the lemniscate.\n\n### Magnetism and telegraphy\n\nGauss made significant contributions to the study of magnetism and telegraphy.\n\n#### Geomagnetism\n\nGauss worked on the study of the Earth's magnetic field and developed a theory of geomagnetism.\n\n#### Electromagnetism\n\nGauss developed a theory of electromagnetism, which is a fundamental concept in physics.\n\n### Potential theory\n\nGauss developed the theory of potential, which is a fundamental concept in physics and engineering.\n\n### Optics\n\nGauss made significant contributions to optics, including the study of the properties of lenses and the behavior of light.\n\n### Mechanics\n\nGauss worked on the study of mechanics, including the development of the theory of motion and the study of the properties of rigid bodies.\n\n### Metrology\n\nGauss worked on the study of metrology, including the development of new methods of measurement and the study of the properties of units.\n\nAnecdotes\n----------\n\nGauss was known for his wit and his sense of humor. One famous anecdote about Gauss is that he was once asked by a student to explain a concept in a simpler way. Gauss replied, \"I have not the slightest idea what you are talking about.\"\n\nHonours and awards\n-------------------\n\nGauss received many honors and awards during his lifetime, including the Copley Medal and the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society.\n\nNames and commemorations\n------------------------\n\nGauss's name has been given to many mathematical concepts, including the Gaussian distribution, the Gaussian curvature, and the Gaussian elimination. He is also commemorated in the Gauss crater on the Moon.\n\nSelected writings\n-----------------\n\n### Mathematics and astronomy\n\n* \"Disquisitiones Arithmeticae\" (1801)\n* \"Theoria motus corporum coelestium\" (1809)\n* \"Theoria combinationis observationum erroribus minimis obnoxiae\" (1821)\n\n### Physics\n\n* \"General theory of terrestrial magnetism\" (1839)\n* \"On the motion of the poles of the Earth\" (1840)\n\n#### Together with Wilhelm Weber\n\n* \"Resultate aus den Beobachtungen des magnetischen Vereins\" (1838)\n\n### Collected works\n\n* \"Werke\" (12 volumes, published posthumously)\n\n### Correspondence\n\n* \"Briefwechsel zwischen Gauss und Bessel\" (published posthumously)\n* \"Briefwechsel zwischen Gauss und Gerling\" (published posthumously)\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n### Notes\n\n### Citations\n\n### Sources\n\nFurther reading\n---------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Carl_Friedrich_Gauss\" following this outline:\n\n#Biography\n##Youth and education\n##Private scholar\n##Professor in Göttingen\n##Gauss's brain\n##Family\n##Personality\n###Scholar\n###Private man\n#Scientific work\n##Algebra and number theory\n###Fundamental theorem of algebra\n###Disquisitiones Arithmeticae\n###Further investigations\n##Analysis\n###Numeric analysis\n##Chronology\n##Astronomy\n##Theory of errors\n##Arc measurement and geodetic survey\n##Differential geometry\n##Non-Euclidean geometry\n##Early topology\n##Minor mathematical accomplishments\n##Magnetism and telegraphy\n###Geomagnetism\n###Electromagnetism\n##Potential theory\n##Optics\n##Mechanics\n##Metrology\n#Anecdotes\n#Honours and awards\n#Names and commemorations\n#Selected writings\n##Mathematics and astronomy\n##Physics\n###Together with Wilhelm Weber\n##Collected works\n##Correspondence\n#References\n##Notes\n##Citations\n##Sources\n#Further reading\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He is a leading figure in Italian politics and has played a significant role in shaping the country's history. Napolitano's presidency was marked by significant events and challenges, including the European sovereign-debt crisis, the resignation of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, and the rise of new political forces in Italy.\n\n#Early life\n\nGiorgio Napolitano was born on June 29, 1925, in Naples, Italy. His father, Giovanni Napolitano, was a lawyer and a socialist, and his mother, Carolina Bobbio, was a housewife. Napolitano grew up in a liberal and anti-fascist family environment, which had a significant influence on his future political views. He studied law at the University of Naples Federico II, where he graduated in 1947.\n\n#Early political career\n\n##World War II and anti-fascist resistance\n\nDuring World War II, Napolitano joined the Italian Resistance, a movement that opposed the fascist regime of Benito Mussolini and the German occupation of Italy. He was involved in various anti-fascist activities, including distributing leaflets and participating in demonstrations. After the war, Napolitano became a member of the Italian Communist Party (PCI), which was one of the main forces in the Italian Resistance.\n\n##From post-war years to the Hungarian Revolution of 1956\n\nIn the post-war years, Napolitano became increasingly involved in politics. He was elected to the Italian Chamber of Deputies in 1953 and served as a member of the Communist Party's central committee. During the 1950s, Napolitano was a strong supporter of the Soviet Union and its communist ideology. However, the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, which was brutally suppressed by Soviet troops, marked a turning point in his views. Napolitano began to question the Soviet model and the PCI's close ties with Moscow.\n\n#Leading member of the Italian Communist Party\n\n##From the 1960s to 1980s\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, Napolitano emerged as one of the leading figures in the Italian Communist Party. He was a key proponent of the party's new strategy, which emphasized the need for reforms and a more democratic approach. Napolitano was also a strong advocate for European integration and played a significant role in Italy's accession to the European Community (EC) in 1958. In the 1980s, Napolitano became the PCI's president, a position he held until the party's dissolution in 1991.\n\n#After the Italian Communist Party\n\n##President of the Chamber of Deputies\n\nIn 1992, Napolitano was elected President of the Chamber of Deputies, a position he held until 1994. During his presidency, he played a key role in the country's transition from a proportional representation system to a mixed-member majoritarian system.\n\n##Late 1990s and early 2000s\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, Napolitano became increasingly involved in European politics. He was a strong supporter of the European Union's (EU) constitutional treaty and played a significant role in Italy's ratification process. Napolitano also served as a member of the European Convention, which drafted the EU's constitutional treaty.\n\n#President of Italy\n\n##First term (2006–2013)\n\n###Election\n\nOn May 10, 2006, Napolitano was elected President of Italy, succeeding Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. He was the first former communist to hold the office.\n\n###Prodi Cabinet\n\nNapolitano's presidency was marked by significant challenges, including the European sovereign-debt crisis. In 2006, he appointed Romano Prodi as Prime Minister, who formed a center-left government. However, the government was short-lived and collapsed in 2008.\n\n###2008 political crisis\n\nIn 2008, Napolitano faced a major political crisis when the Prodi government collapsed. He played a key role in mediating between the different parties and eventually appointed Silvio Berlusconi as Prime Minister.\n\n###Eluana Englaro incident\n\nIn 2009, Napolitano faced criticism for his handling of the Eluana Englaro case, in which a woman in a coma was at the center of a right-to-die debate. Napolitano was accused of intervening in the case and ordering the woman's feeding tube to be reinserted.\n\n###2011 political crisis\n\nIn 2011, Napolitano faced another major crisis when the Berlusconi government collapsed. He played a key role in mediating between the different parties and eventually appointed Mario Monti as Prime Minister.\n\n##Second term (2013–2015)\n\n###Re-election\n\nOn April 20, 2013, Napolitano was re-elected President of Italy, becoming the first president to serve a second term.\n\n###Letta Cabinet\n\nNapolitano appointed Enrico Letta as Prime Minister, who formed a grand coalition government.\n\n###Renzi Cabinet\n\nIn 2014, Napolitano appointed Matteo Renzi as Prime Minister, who formed a center-left government.\n\n##Resignation\n\nOn January 14, 2015, Napolitano resigned as President of Italy, citing age and health reasons.\n\n##Later life\n\nAfter his resignation, Napolitano retired from public life. However, he remains a respected figure in Italian politics and continues to be involved in various initiatives and organizations.\n\n#Personal life\n\n##Relations with the Catholic Church\n\nNapolitano has had a complex relationship with the Catholic Church throughout his life. As a communist, he was critical of the Church's role in Italian society.

Native to the Arctic region, the polar bear is well adapted to its harsh, icy environment, with a thick layer of fat and a white coat that helps it blend in with its surroundings. The polar bear is a highly specialized species that plays a crucial role in the Arctic ecosystem, and its conservation status is of great concern due to the impact of climate change on its habitat.\n\nNaming\n-------\n\nThe name \"polar bear\" is derived from the Greek word \"arktos,\" meaning \"bear,\" and the Latin word \"maritimus,\" meaning \"of the sea.\" The scientific name \"Ursus maritimus\" was first used by the Swedish botanist and zoologist Carolus Linnaeus in 1758.\n\nTaxonomy\n---------\n\nThe polar bear is a member of the family Ursidae and is closely related to the brown bear (Ursus arctos). The two species are thought to have diverged from a common ancestor around 200,000 years ago. There are two subspecies of polar bear: the nominate subspecies (Ursus maritimus maritimus) and the sea-ice bear (Ursus maritimus marinus).\n\n### Evolution\n\nThe polar bear is thought to have evolved from a brown bear-like ancestor that lived in the northern hemisphere during the Pleistocene era. The earliest known fossil evidence of polar bears dates back to around 100,000 years ago. Over time, the polar bear adapted to its Arctic environment, developing a range of specialized features such as a white coat, a layer of fat, and large paws that act as snowshoes.\n\nCharacteristics\n---------------\n\nThe polar bear is a large, carnivorous mammal with a range of distinctive characteristics. Adult males typically weigh between 350-700 kg (772-1,543 lb), while females typically weigh between 150-300 kg (331-661 lb). The polar bear's body is well adapted to its Arctic environment, with a thick layer of fat (up to 4 cm or 1.6 in thick) and a white coat that helps it blend in with its surroundings. The polar bear's fur is made up of two layers: a thick undercoat and a longer, guard hair layer. The guard hairs are transparent and hollow, which helps to scatter and reflect sunlight and give the polar bear its white appearance.\n\nDistribution and Habitat\n-------------------------\n\nThe polar bear is found in the Arctic region, including Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Norway, and Russia. The polar bear's habitat is typically sea ice, which it uses as a platform to hunt and feed on seals. The polar bear is also found on land, particularly during the summer months when the sea ice melts. In these areas, the polar bear will often feed on berries, lichens, and other vegetation.\n\nBehaviour and Ecology\n----------------------\n\nThe polar bear is a highly specialized species that plays a crucial role in the Arctic ecosystem. Its behavior and ecology are closely tied to its sea ice habitat, and it is well adapted to its harsh, icy environment.\n\n### Social Life\n\nPolar bears are generally solitary animals, only coming together to mate or to feed on a carcass. Female polar bears will often care for their young, teaching them important survival skills such as hunting and swimming. Male polar bears will often engage in play-fighting, which helps to establish dominance and develop important skills such as hunting and defense.\n\n### Diet and Hunting\n\nThe polar bear's diet consists mainly of seals, which it hunts using a range of strategies such as stalking, ambushing, and waiting at breathing holes. The polar bear will also feed on other marine mammals such as walruses and belugas, as well as carrion and other land-based prey. The polar bear is a skilled hunter, with a highly developed sense of smell and excellent eyesight.\n\n### Reproduction and Development\n\nFemale polar bears typically give birth to two cubs per litter, which are born blind and helpless. The cubs will nurse for around 18-24 months, during which time they will develop important survival skills such as hunting and swimming. Male polar bears will often play a role in caring for the cubs, teaching them important skills such as hunting and defense.\n\n### Mortality\n\nPolar bears can live for up to 25-30 years in the wild, although the average lifespan is around 15-18 years. The main causes of mortality for polar bears are starvation, drowning, and human-caused mortality such as hunting and poaching.\n\nConservation Status\n-------------------\n\nThe polar bear is listed as \"vulnerable\" on the IUCN Red List, due to the impact of climate change on its sea ice habitat. The polar bear's population is projected to decline by 30% by 2050, due to the loss of sea ice and the resulting impact on its ability to hunt and feed.\n\nRelationship with Humans\n-----------------------\n\nThe polar bear has a complex and often conflicted relationship with humans, ranging from exploitation and conflict to conservation and admiration.\n\n### Exploitation\n\nPolar bears have been hunted for their fur, meat, and body parts, which are used in traditional medicine. The hunting of polar bears is regulated by international law, although poaching remains a significant threat to the species.\n\n### Conflicts\n\nPolar bears and humans often come into conflict, particularly in areas where their habitats overlap. Polar bears may attack humans in self-defense, or when they are attracted to human food or waste. Humans may also attack polar bears in self-defense, or when they are protecting their property or livelihoods.\n\n### Captivity\n\nPolar bears are often kept in captivity in zoos and aquariums, where they are used for education and conservation purposes. However, the keeping of polar bears in captivity is often controversial, due to concerns about animal welfare and the impact of captivity on the species.\n\n### Cultural Significance\n\nThe polar bear has significant cultural and symbolic meaning, particularly in the Arctic region. The polar bear is often seen as a symbol of strength, resilience, and adaptability, and is featured in the mythology and folklore of many Arctic cultures.\n\nSee Also\n--------\n\n* Arctic ecosystem\n* Brown bear\n* Climate change\n* Conservation biology\n* IUCN Red List\n* Sea ice\n* Ursidae\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nThis article is a general overview of the polar bear, and is not intended to be a comprehensive or technical treatment of the subject.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n* None\n\nBibliography\n------------\n\n* None\n\nExternal Links\n---------------\n\n* None", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Polar_bear\" following this outline:\n\n#Naming\n#Taxonomy\n##Evolution\n#Characteristics\n#Distribution and habitat\n#Behaviour and ecology\n##Social life\n##Diet and hunting\n##Reproduction and development\n##Mortality\n#Conservation status\n#Relationship with humans\n##Exploitation\n##Conflicts\n##Captivity\n##Cultural significance\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Commissioned in 1983 as Slava, the ship was later renamed Moskva in 1995. During its service, the Moskva played a significant role in various naval operations and exercises, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n# History\n\n## As Slava\n\nThe Slava was laid down on November 28, 1976, at the 61 Kommunara Shipbuilding Plant in Mykolaiv, Ukraine. The ship was launched on July 27, 1979, and commissioned into the Soviet Navy on January 30, 1983. Initially, the Slava was assigned to the Soviet Black Sea Fleet, with its homeport in Sevastopol, Crimea.\n\nIn the early 1990s, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Slava underwent a major overhaul, which included the installation of new radar and electronic warfare systems. The ship also received a new coat of paint and underwent minor repairs.\n\n## As Moskva\n\nIn 1995, the Slava was renamed Moskva, in honor of the Russian capital city. The renaming ceremony took place on May 16, 1995, at the ship's homeport in Sevastopol. After the renaming, the Moskva continued to serve as the flagship of the Russian Black Sea Fleet.\n\nThroughout the late 1990s and early 2000s, the Moskva participated in various naval exercises and operations, including joint exercises with other Russian naval vessels and international exercises with NATO member countries. In 2003, the Moskva visited the Greek port city of Piraeus, where it participated in a naval parade.\n\n## Russian invasion of Ukraine\n\nIn 2014, the Moskva played a significant role in the Russian annexation of Crimea, which took place during the Ukrainian revolution. The ship served as a command center for Russian naval operations in the region.\n\n### Snake Island campaign\n\nIn August 2021, the Moskva was involved in a dispute with Ukraine over the status of Snake Island, a small island in the Black Sea that is claimed by both Russia and Ukraine. The ship was deployed to the area to support Russian claims to the island.\n\nOn August 23, 2021, the Moskva intercepted a Ukrainian naval vessel that was attempting to approach the island. The incident sparked a diplomatic row between Russia and Ukraine, with both countries accusing each other of aggression.\n\n### Sinking\n\nOn April 13, 2022, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Moskva was reportedly sunk by a Ukrainian Neptune anti-ship missile while it was operating in the Black Sea. The incident occurred about 80 kilometers (50 miles) south of the Ukrainian port city of Odesa.\n\nAccording to Russian officials, the ship suffered a fire and was damaged, but it was not sunk. However, Ukrainian officials claimed that the ship had been sunk, and that all crew members on board had been killed.\n\nThe sinking of the Moskva was widely reported in international media, and it was seen as a significant blow to the Russian Navy. The incident marked one of the most significant losses for the Russian military during the invasion of Ukraine.\n\n# Notes\n\n* The Moskva was the third ship of the Slava-class to be built, following the Slava and the Marshal Ustinov.\n* The ship was powered by two gas turbines, which provided a total output of 110,000 horsepower.\n* The Moskva was armed with a range of weapons, including anti-ship missiles, anti-aircraft missiles, and torpedoes.\n* The ship had a crew of approximately 500 personnel.\n\n# References\n\n# External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Russian_cruiser_Moskva\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##As Slava\n##As Moskva\n##Russian invasion of Ukraine\n###Snake Island campaign\n###Sinking\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The incident occurred during a large-scale Russian missile strike against Ukrainian cities, with Ukrainian forces firing missiles to intercept the incoming Russian projectiles.\n\n#Background\n\nThe 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine had been ongoing since February, with Russia launching a series of missile strikes against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure. Ukraine's air defense systems had been actively engaged in intercepting Russian missiles, with some projectiles falling on Ukrainian territory and others being destroyed in mid-air. Poland, a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), had been providing military aid to Ukraine and hosting thousands of Ukrainian refugees fleeing the conflict.\n\n#Explosion\n\nOn November 15, 2022, at around 3:40 pm local time, a missile exploded in the village of Przewodów, Poland, approximately 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) from the Ukrainian border. The explosion occurred on a farm, killing two Polish citizens, Bogusław Wos and Bogdan Ciupek, who were working at the site. The blast also damaged a grain dryer and a tractor. Polish authorities immediately launched an investigation into the incident, with the Polish Ministry of Defense confirming that the explosion was caused by a missile.\n\n#Investigation\n\nThe Polish government launched a joint investigation with NATO and Ukrainian authorities to determine the origin and circumstances of the missile explosion. Polish President Andrzej Duda stated that the investigation would be conducted in a transparent manner, with all relevant evidence being shared with NATO and Ukrainian officials. Preliminary findings suggested that the missile was a Soviet-era S-300 surface-to-air missile, which was likely fired by Ukrainian forces in response to a Russian missile strike.\n\n#Reactions\n\n##Poland\n\nThe Polish government condemned the incident, with President Duda stating that the explosion was a \"tragic accident\" and expressing condolences to the families of the victims. Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki called an emergency meeting of the Polish National Security Council to discuss the incident and potential responses. Polish authorities also increased military presence along the border with Ukraine as a precautionary measure.\n\n##International\n\n###Russia\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense denied any involvement in the incident, stating that Russian missiles were not directed at Poland and that the explosion was likely caused by a Ukrainian air defense missile. Russian officials also accused Ukraine of attempting to provoke a conflict with NATO.\n\n###Ukraine\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed condolences to the families of the victims and stated that Ukraine was willing to cooperate with the investigation. Ukrainian officials also denied any intentional targeting of Polish territory, stating that Ukrainian forces were acting in self-defense against Russian missile strikes.\n\n###NATO officials and member countries\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg condemned the incident, stating that the alliance stood in solidarity with Poland and supported the ongoing investigation. NATO officials also emphasized the importance of de-escalating the conflict and preventing further incidents. Several NATO member countries, including the United States, Germany, and France, expressed support for Poland and called for a thorough investigation.\n\n###Others\n\nThe European Union and the United Nations also condemned the incident, calling for restraint and de-escalation. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) offered to support the investigation and facilitate dialogue between Ukraine and Russia.\n\n#Related incidents\n\nThe 2022 missile explosion in Poland was not an isolated incident, with several other cases of missiles and projectiles crossing the border from Ukraine into Poland and other neighboring countries. In October 2022, a Ukrainian S-300 missile landed in the Romanian town of Tulcea, causing no casualties or damage. Similar incidents have also been reported in Moldova and Slovakia.\n\n#See also\n\n* 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* NATO-Ukraine relations\n* Russia-Ukraine relations\n* List of incidents during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_missile_explosion_in_Poland\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Explosion\n#Investigation\n#Reactions\n##Poland\n##International\n###Russia\n###Ukraine\n###NATO officials and member countries\n###Others\n#Related incidents\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The election was held in accordance with the Constitution of Estonia, which stipulates that parliamentary elections must be held at least once every four years.\n\n# Electoral system\n\nEstonia uses a proportional representation system to elect its parliament. The country is divided into 12 electoral districts, each of which elects between 5 and 13 members of parliament. Seats are allocated to parties using the d'Hondt method.\n\n## Seats by electoral district\n\nThe 12 electoral districts in Estonia are:\n\n* District 1: Haabersti, Põhja-Tallinn, and Kristiine\n* District 2: Kesklinn, Lasnamäe, and Pirita\n* District 3: Mustamäe and Nõmme\n* District 4: Harju and Rapla\n* District 5: Hiiu, Lääne, and Saare\n* District 6: Lääne-Viru\n* District 7: Ida-Viru\n* District 8: Järva and Viljandi\n* District 9: Jõgeva and Tartu\n* District 10: Tartu\n* District 11: Võru, Valga, and Põlva\n* District 12: Pärnu\n\n## Pre-election composition\n\nThe 14th Riigikogu, which was elected in 2019, consisted of six parties: the Estonian Reform Party, the Estonian Centre Party, the Conservative People's Party of Estonia, the Estonian Social Democratic Party, Isamaa, and the Estonian Greens.\n\n# Contesting parties\n\nA total of nine parties contested the 2023 Estonian parliamentary election.\n\n## Party manifestos and slogans\n\nEach of the contesting parties released a manifesto outlining their policies and goals. The Estonian Reform Party's manifesto focused on economic growth and stability, while the Estonian Centre Party's manifesto emphasized the importance of social welfare and public services. The Conservative People's Party of Estonia's manifesto took a more nationalist tone, emphasizing the need to protect Estonian culture and identity.\n\n# Campaign\n\nThe campaign for the 2023 Estonian parliamentary election began in earnest in January 2023, with parties launching their manifestos and beginning to campaign in earnest.\n\n## Issues\n\nA number of issues dominated the campaign, including the economy, healthcare, and education. The Estonian Reform Party focused on its record on the economy, while the Estonian Centre Party emphasized the need for greater investment in public services.\n\n## Debates\n\nA series of debates were held during the campaign, featuring representatives from the contesting parties. The debates were broadcast on television and online, and provided an opportunity for voters to hear from the parties and make informed decisions.\n\n# Opinion polls\n\nA number of opinion polls were conducted during the campaign, providing insight into the views of Estonian voters. The polls suggested that the Estonian Reform Party and the Estonian Centre Party were the two most popular parties, with the Conservative People's Party of Estonia also performing strongly.\n\n# Results\n\nThe results of the 2023 Estonian parliamentary election were announced on 6 March 2023.\n\n## Results by constituency\n\nThe results of the election by constituency were as follows:\n\n* District 1: Estonian Reform Party (3 seats), Estonian Centre Party (2 seats)\n* District 2: Estonian Centre Party (3 seats), Estonian Reform Party (2 seats)\n* District 3: Estonian Reform Party (3 seats), Estonian Centre Party (2 seats)\n* District 4: Estonian Reform Party (3 seats), Estonian Centre Party (2 seats)\n* District 5: Estonian Centre Party (2 seats), Estonian Reform Party (1 seat)\n* District 6: Estonian Reform Party (2 seats), Estonian Centre Party (1 seat)\n* District 7: Estonian Centre Party (2 seats), Estonian Reform Party (1 seat)\n* District 8: Estonian Reform Party (2 seats), Estonian Centre Party (1 seat)\n* District 9: Estonian Reform Party (2 seats), Estonian Centre Party (1 seat)\n* District 10: Estonian Centre Party (2 seats), Estonian Reform Party (1 seat)\n* District 11: Estonian Reform Party (2 seats), Estonian Centre Party (1 seat)\n* District 12: Estonian Centre Party (2 seats), Estonian Reform Party (1 seat)\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe results of the election were seen as a victory for the Estonian Reform Party, which won the most seats in the Riigikogu.\n\n## Government formation\n\nFollowing the election, the Estonian Reform Party began negotiations with other parties to form a coalition government.

The outbreak was characterized by multiple long-lived supercells that produced large, destructive tornadoes, particularly on March 6. The worst of the damage occurred in Iowa, where a single tornado caused significant destruction and loss of life.\n\n#Meteorological synopsis\n\nThe outbreak was fueled by a strong low-pressure system that developed over the Rocky Mountains on March 4. As the system moved eastward, it interacted with a strong cold front that was moving southward from Canada, creating a highly unstable atmosphere across the central and southern United States. Moisture from the Gulf of Mexico streamed northward into the region, creating a highly volatile mixture of warm, moist air near the surface and cooler, drier air aloft.\n\n##March 5\n\nOn March 5, a cluster of thunderstorms developed over eastern Kansas and western Missouri, producing several tornadoes in the late afternoon and evening hours. The storms were fueled by strong wind shear and instability in the atmosphere, but were largely weakened by the time they reached the ground. Despite this, several tornadoes were reported, including an EF2 that caused significant damage in the town of Harrisonville, Missouri.\n\n##March 6–7\n\nAs the low-pressure system continued to move eastward, the atmosphere became increasingly unstable, leading to the development of multiple long-lived supercells. These storms produced large, destructive tornadoes that affected several states, including Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio. The worst of the damage occurred in Iowa, where a single tornado caused significant destruction and loss of life.

The worst of the damage occurred in the town of Winterset, where several buildings were destroyed, including a school and a hospital. The tornado also caused significant damage to the Iowa State Fairgrounds in Des Moines.\n\n#Aftermath\n\nThe tornado outbreak caused significant damage and loss of life, particularly in Iowa. Several communities were severely affected, with many buildings destroyed or damaged. The state of Iowa declared a state of emergency, with several counties affected by the tornadoes.

A prominent figure in the Romanian Communist Party, Rădulescu navigated the treacherous waters of ideological orthodoxy, patronage, and personal conviction, leaving a lasting impact on the nation's literary and intellectual heritage.\n\n#Biography\n\n##Early life and FSD\n\nBorn on April 22, 1917, in the town of Curtea de Argeș, Gogu Rădulescu came from a humble background. His early life was marked by financial struggles, which forced him to abandon his studies and work as a clerk. However, his passion for literature and writing eventually led him to the University of Bucharest, where he studied Romanian language and literature. Rădulescu's academic pursuits were soon interrupted by the outbreak of World War II, during which he became involved with the fascist Iron Guard movement.\n\nIn 1941, Rădulescu joined the fascist Legionnaire movement, but his involvement was short-lived. He soon became disillusioned with the movement's ideology and defected to the Romanian Communist Party. This decision marked the beginning of his long and complex relationship with the communist regime. Rădulescu's early years as a communist were marked by his involvement with the Frontul Studenților Democrați (FSD), a student organization affiliated with the party.\n\n##Wartime desertion and return\n\nDuring World War II, Rădulescu was drafted into the Romanian Army and fought on the Eastern Front. However, he soon became disillusioned with the war effort and deserted, fleeing to the Soviet Union. Rădulescu spent several years in the USSR, where he became acquainted with Soviet ideology and culture. He eventually returned to Romania in 1947, where he resumed his involvement with the communist party.\n\n##1952 fall and 1956 recovery\n\nRădulescu's early years in the communist party were marked by a series of tumultuous events. In 1952, he fell out of favor with the party leadership, who accused him of being too liberal and pro-Western. This led to a period of exile and isolation, during which Rădulescu was forced to abandon his literary pursuits. However, in 1956, he made a dramatic comeback, thanks in part to the intervention of Ana Pauker, a prominent party leader. Rădulescu's rehabilitation marked the beginning of a new phase in his career, during which he became a prominent figure in Romanian literary circles.\n\n##With Ceaușescu\n\nRădulescu's fortunes changed dramatically with the rise of Nicolae Ceaușescu to power in 1965. Ceaușescu, who was known for his nationalist and anti-Soviet policies, saw in Rădulescu a kindred spirit. The two men forged a close relationship, with Rădulescu becoming one of Ceaușescu's closest advisors on cultural matters.\n\n##Patronage and liberalism\n\nUnder Ceaușescu's rule, Rădulescu became a powerful patron of the arts, using his influence to promote liberal and nationalist causes. He played a key role in promoting the careers of several prominent Romanian writers, including Marin Preda and Eugen Barbu. Rădulescu's patronage was not limited to literature; he also supported the development of Romanian film and theater.\n\n##Protochronism and austerity debates\n\nHowever, Rădulescu's relationship with Ceaușescu was not without controversy. In the 1970s, Rădulescu became embroiled in a heated debate over protochronism, a cultural and ideological movement that emphasized Romania's unique cultural and historical heritage. Rădulescu, who was initially sympathetic to protochronism, eventually became disillusioned with its nationalist and xenophobic overtones.\n\nRădulescu's criticism of protochronism led to a series of public debates with other prominent intellectuals, including the writer and critic, Adrian Marino. These debates, which were widely publicized in the Romanian media, marked a turning point in Rădulescu's career, as he began to distance himself from Ceaușescu's regime.\n\n##Downfall, prosecution, and death\n\nRădulescu's relationship with Ceaușescu ultimately proved to be his downfall. In 1977, he was arrested and charged with treason, following a series of public criticisms of the regime. Rădulescu spent several years in prison, where he was subjected to physical and psychological torture. He was eventually released in 1983, but his health was irreparably damaged.\n\nGogu Rădulescu died on December 26, 1991, at the age of 74, just a year after Ceaușescu's execution. His legacy as a literary critic, essayist, and politician continues to be felt in Romania, where he is remembered as a complex and multifaceted figure who navigated the treacherous waters of ideological orthodoxy and personal conviction.\n\n#Legacy\n\nRădulescu's legacy is complex and multifaceted, reflecting his diverse roles as literary critic, essayist, and politician. His contributions to Romanian literature and culture are undeniable, and his influence can be seen in the work of several prominent writers and intellectuals.\n\nHowever, Rădulescu's relationship with Ceaușescu's regime has also been the subject of controversy, with some critics accusing him of complicity and opportunism. These criticisms notwithstanding, Rădulescu's legacy remains an important part of Romania's cultural and intellectual heritage, a testament to the complex and often fraught nature of intellectual and artistic expression under authoritarian regimes.\n\n#Notes\n\n#References", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Gogu_Rădulescu\" following this outline:\n\n#Biography\n##Early life and FSD\n##Wartime desertion and return\n##1952 fall and 1956 recovery\n##With Ceaușescu\n##Patronage and liberalism\n##Protochronism and austerity debates\n##Downfall, prosecution, and death\n#Legacy\n#Notes\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The operation aimed to reclaim lost territories, disrupt Russian supply lines, and ultimately change the course of the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War.\n\n# Background\n\n## State of the war\n\nBy 2023, the Russo-Ukrainian War had been ongoing for nearly a year, with both sides suffering significant losses. The conflict had entered a stalemate, with Ukrainian forces defending their positions against repeated Russian attacks. The war had caused widespread destruction, displacement of civilians, and a severe humanitarian crisis. Despite international pressure and diplomatic efforts, a peaceful resolution seemed elusive.\n\n## Russian defenses\n\nThe Russian military had established a complex network of defensive lines, fortifications, and minefields to protect their gains. These defenses were designed to slow down or repel any Ukrainian counterattack, allowing Russian forces to regroup and counterattack. The defenses included trenches, bunkers, and fortified positions, as well as extensive minefields and barriers to hinder Ukrainian advances.\n\n# Prelude\n\n## Planning\n\nUkrainian military planners began preparing for a counteroffensive in late 2022, with the aim of launching a decisive operation in the spring of 2023. The planning process involved extensive intelligence gathering, analysis of Russian defenses, and development of a comprehensive strategy to break through Russian lines. Ukrainian commanders worked closely with international partners, including NATO countries, to secure military aid, training, and logistical support.\n\n## Shaping operations\n\nIn the months leading up to the counteroffensive, Ukrainian forces conducted a series of shaping operations to weaken Russian defenses and create favorable conditions for the main attack. These operations included artillery strikes, drone attacks, and special forces raids aimed at disrupting Russian supply lines, destroying key infrastructure, and demoralizing Russian troops.\n\n# Counteroffensive\n\n## Start date\n\nThe 2023 Ukrainian counteroffensive began on June 4, 2023, with a massive artillery barrage along the entire front line. The operation involved tens of thousands of Ukrainian troops, supported by hundreds of tanks, artillery pieces, and aircraft.\n\n## Southern front\n\n### Melitopol direction\n\nIn the south, Ukrainian forces launched a major thrust towards the city of Melitopol, which had been under Russian occupation since February 2022. The attack involved a combined arms force, including infantry, armor, and artillery, which quickly broke through Russian defenses and advanced deep into Russian-held territory.\n\n### Berdiansk direction: Staromaiorske-Urozhaine\n\nTo the east of Melitopol, Ukrainian forces launched a secondary attack towards the town of Berdiansk, which had been a key Russian logistics hub. The attack focused on the Staromaiorske-Urozhaine axis, where Ukrainian troops quickly overran Russian defenses and advanced towards the Sea of Azov.\n\n## Eastern front\n\n### Donetsk Oblast\n\nIn the east, Ukrainian forces launched a series of attacks in the Donetsk Oblast, aimed at recapturing key cities and towns, including Bakhmut and Sloviansk. The fighting was intense, with both sides suffering heavy losses, but Ukrainian forces gradually gained ground, pushing Russian troops back towards the Russian border.\n\n## Dnieper front\n\nAlong the Dnieper River, Ukrainian forces launched a series of attacks aimed at recapturing key cities and towns, including Kherson and Mykolaiv. The fighting was fierce, with both sides exchanging artillery fire and conducting counterattacks, but Ukrainian forces slowly gained ground, pushing Russian troops back towards the river.\n\n## Behind front lines\n\n### Crimea and the Black Sea\n\nAs Ukrainian forces advanced along the front lines, they also launched a series of operations behind Russian lines, aimed at disrupting Russian supply lines and weakening Russian defenses. These operations included attacks on Russian airbases, ports, and logistics hubs, as well as sabotage and intelligence operations.\n\n### Other areas\n\nUkrainian forces also launched attacks in other areas, including the Luhansk Oblast and the Zaporizhzhia Oblast, aimed at recapturing key cities and towns, and disrupting Russian supply lines.\n\n## Result\n\nThe 2023 Ukrainian counteroffensive was a major success, with Ukrainian forces recapturing significant territory, disrupting Russian supply lines, and weakening Russian defenses. The operation marked a turning point in the war, as Ukrainian forces gained the initiative and began to push Russian troops back towards the Russian border.\n\n# Strengths\n\n## Personnel\n\nThe Ukrainian military had undergone significant reforms and modernization since 2014, with a focus on creating a more professional, mobile, and effective force.

This period saw a resurgence of interest in classical Greek and Roman art and culture, which had a profound impact on the development of sculpture in Italy. Italian Renaissance sculpture is characterized by its use of naturalism, humanism, and classical influences, and is marked by the works of renowned artists such as Michelangelo, Donatello, and Giambologna.\n\n# Periods\n\nItalian Renaissance sculpture can be broadly divided into three periods: the Early Renaissance (14th-15th century), the High Renaissance (15th-16th century), and the Late Renaissance (16th-17th century). Each period saw significant developments in style, technique, and patronage, which shaped the course of sculpture in Italy.\n\n# Materials\n\nItalian Renaissance sculptors worked with a variety of materials, each with its own unique characteristics and challenges.\n\n## Stone\n\nStone was a popular material for sculpture, particularly marble, which was prized for its beauty and durability. Many famous sculptures, such as Michelangelo's David, were carved from Carrara marble, which was quarried in Tuscany. Other types of stone, such as limestone and sandstone, were also used, often for more decorative or architectural purposes.\n\n## Metal\n\nMetal was another important material for sculpture, particularly bronze, which was used for both large-scale and small-scale works. Bronze was valued for its durability and versatility, and was often used for decorative or commemorative purposes, such as statues and medals.\n\n## Wood\n\nWood was a relatively inexpensive and accessible material for sculpture, particularly for small-scale or decorative works. Wood was often used for carvings, such as figurines or reliefs, and was sometimes painted or gilded for added decoration.\n\n## Terracotta\n\nTerracotta was a type of earthenware that was used for sculpture, particularly for small-scale or decorative works. Terracotta was relatively inexpensive and easy to work with, and was often used for figurines, vases, and other decorative objects.\n\n## Other materials\n\nOther materials, such as ivory, bone, and wax, were also used for sculpture, often for small-scale or decorative works. These materials were valued for their beauty and durability, and were often used for intricate or detailed carvings.\n\n## Coloured sculpture\n\nColoured sculpture was a popular technique during the Italian Renaissance, particularly for decorative or architectural purposes. Sculptors used a range of techniques, including painting, gilding, and glazing, to add colour and decoration to their works.\n\n# Settings\n\nItalian Renaissance sculpture was often created for specific settings, such as churches, tombs, and public spaces.\n\n## Churches and tombs\n\nMany sculptures were created for churches and tombs, where they served as devotional objects or memorials. These sculptures often depicted saints, martyrs, or other biblical figures, and were designed to inspire devotion or reverence.\n\n## Civic pride\n\nSculptures were also created for civic purposes, such as to commemorate important events or to celebrate the city's patron saints. These sculptures often depicted mythological or allegorical figures, and were designed to promote civic pride and identity.\n\n### Fountains\n\nFountains were a popular setting for sculpture, particularly in public spaces. Sculptors created elaborate fountains with intricate carvings and figures, which served as decorative and functional features.\n\n## Portraits\n\nPortraits were a popular genre of sculpture during the Italian Renaissance, particularly for commemorative or decorative purposes.\n\n### Equestrian statues\n\nEquestrian statues were a popular type of portrait sculpture, particularly for public spaces. These statues depicted important figures, such as rulers or military leaders, on horseback, and were designed to promote civic pride and identity.\n\n### Shoulder busts\n\nShoulder busts were a popular type of portrait sculpture, particularly for decorative or commemorative purposes. These busts depicted the subject from the shoulders up, and were often created in marble or bronze.\n\n### Medals\n\nMedals were a popular type of portrait sculpture, particularly for commemorative or decorative purposes. These medals depicted the subject in relief, and were often created in metal or terracotta.\n\n## Small sculpture\n\nSmall sculpture was a popular genre during the Italian Renaissance, particularly for decorative or commemorative purposes. Sculptors created intricate and detailed carvings, often in materials such as ivory or wax, which were prized for their beauty and delicacy.\n\n# Workshops\n\nMany Italian Renaissance sculptors worked in workshops, where they collaborated with other artists and artisans to create large-scale or complex works.\n\n## Women sculptors\n\nWomen sculptors were relatively rare during the Italian Renaissance, but some notable examples include Properzia de' Rossi and Sofonisba Anguissola. These women often worked in workshops or as assistants to male sculptors, and created works that were highly praised by their contemporaries.\n\n# Guilds\n\nGuilds played an important role in the development of sculpture during the Italian Renaissance. Guilds were organizations of artists and artisans who worked together to promote their interests and regulate their profession.\n\n# Patrons\n\nPatronage was essential for the development of sculpture during the Italian Renaissance. Patrons, including the Church, the state, and wealthy individuals, commissioned sculptures and provided financial support for artists.\n\n# Development of style\n\nItalian Renaissance sculpture developed over several centuries, influenced by classical Greek and Roman art and culture.\n\n## To 1400\n\nBefore 1400, sculpture in Italy was heavily influenced by Byzantine and Gothic styles, which emphasized formalism and decorative detail. However, with the rise of humanism and the revival of classical learning, sculptors began to look to ancient Greek and Roman models for inspiration.\n\n## From 1400\n\nThe 15th century saw a significant shift in style, as sculptors began to adopt more naturalistic and humanistic approaches.\n\n### Doors of the Florence Baptistery\n\nThe Doors of the Florence Baptistery, created by Lorenzo Ghiberti, are a landmark example of early Renaissance sculpture. These doors, which depict scenes from the Old Testament, are notable for their naturalism and humanism, and set a new standard for sculpture in Italy.\n\n### Donatello\n\nDonatello was a key figure in the development of Renaissance sculpture, known for his innovative and expressive works. His sculptures, such as the famous bronze David, are characterized by their naturalism, humanism, and emotional intensity.\n\n### Middle of the century\n\nBy the middle of the 15th century, sculpture in Italy had reached a new level of sophistication and complexity. Sculptors such as Jacopo della Quercia and Andrea del Verrocchio were creating works that were highly praised for their beauty and technical skill.\n\n### Lombardy\n\nLombardy, particularly the city of Milan, was an important center for sculpture during the Italian Renaissance. Sculptors such as Cristoforo Mantegazza and Tommaso Cazzaniga created works that were highly praised for their beauty and technical skill.\n\n### Crisis of the 1490s\n\nThe 1490s saw a crisis in Italian sculpture, as many artists were forced to flee or go into exile due to the turmoil and upheaval caused by the French invasion of Italy. However, this period also saw the emergence of new artists and styles, such as the enigmatic and expressive works of Leonardo da Vinci.\n\n## 16th century\n\nThe 16th century saw the rise of Mannerism and the Late Renaissance, which were characterized by a sense of anxiety and disillusionment.\n\n### Michelangelo\n\nMichelangelo was a towering figure in Italian Renaissance sculpture, known for his technical skill and emotional intensity. His sculptures, such as the famous Pietà, are characterized by their naturalism, humanism, and expressive power.\n\n### Mannerist and Late Renaissance sculpture\n\nMannerist and Late Renaissance sculpture were characterized by a sense of anxiety and disillusionment, as well as a growing sense of self-awareness and introspection. Sculptors such as Benvenuto Cellini and Giambologna created works that were highly praised for their beauty and technical skill.\n\n### Giambologna\n\nGiambologna was a Flemish sculptor who worked in Italy during the Late Renaissance. His sculptures, such as the famous Rape of the Sabine Women, are characterized by their technical skill, emotional intensity, and sense of drama and movement.\n\n# Italians abroad\n\nMany Italian Renaissance sculptors worked abroad, particularly in France, Spain, and the Holy Roman Empire.\n\n# Notes\n\nNote: This article is a general overview of Italian Renaissance sculpture, and is not intended to be a comprehensive or exhaustive treatment of the subject.\n\n# References\n\nNote: This article does not include citations or references, as per the requirements.\n\n# External links\n\nNote: This article does not include external links, as per the requirements.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Italian_Renaissance_sculpture\" following this outline:\n\n#Periods\n#Materials\n##Stone\n##Metal\n##Wood\n##Terracotta\n##Other materials\n##Coloured sculpture\n#Settings\n##Churches and tombs\n##Civic pride\n###Fountains\n##Portraits\n###Equestrian statues\n###Shoulder busts\n###Medals\n##Small sculpture\n#Workshops\n##Women sculptors\n#Guilds\n#Patrons\n#Development of style\n##To 1400\n##From 1400\n###Doors of the Florence Baptistery\n###Donatello\n###Middle of the century\n###Lombardy\n###Crisis of the 1490s\n##16th century\n###Michelangelo\n###Mannerist and Late Renaissance sculpture\n###Giambologna\n#Italians abroad\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The visit sparked a significant reaction from the People's Republic of China (PRC), which views Taiwan as a part of its territory, and had far-reaching implications for international relations and global geopolitics.\n\n# Background\n\nThe visit was part of a larger trip by Pelosi to Asia, which included stops in Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea. The trip was intended to demonstrate the United States' commitment to its allies and partners in the region, as well as to address various regional and global issues. However, the stop in Taiwan was not publicly disclosed until the day of the visit, reportedly due to security concerns.\n\nThe visit was seen as significant due to the sensitive nature of the Taiwan issue. The PRC has long claimed Taiwan as its own territory and has threatened to use force to bring the island under its control. The United States, on the other hand, has a long-standing policy of strategic ambiguity towards Taiwan, neither confirming nor denying its support for the island's independence.\n\n# Visit\n\nPelosi and her delegation arrived in Taipei on the evening of August 2, 2022, and were greeted by Taiwanese officials, including President Tsai Ing-wen. The visit included a series of high-level meetings, including a meeting with Tsai and a speech to the Taiwanese parliament. Pelosi also visited the National Human Rights Museum and met with various civil society groups.\n\nDuring her speech to the parliament, Pelosi emphasized the United States' commitment to democracy and human rights, and praised Taiwan's progress in these areas. She also reiterated the United States' support for Taiwan's security and stability, and called for increased cooperation between the two countries.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## United States\n\nThe visit was widely supported by politicians from both parties in the United States. Many lawmakers praised Pelosi for her leadership and commitment to democracy and human rights. However, some Republicans criticized the visit, arguing that it was provocative and could escalate tensions with China.\n\nThe Biden administration also expressed support for the visit, with the State Department saying that it was consistent with the United States' long-standing policy towards Taiwan. However, the administration also emphasized the need for calm and restraint, and called on all parties to avoid actions that could escalate tensions.\n\n## People's Republic of China\n\nThe PRC responded to the visit with outrage, with the foreign ministry calling it a \"serious violation\" of China's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The PRC also announced a series of military exercises around Taiwan, including live-fire drills and missile tests.\n\n### Hong Kong\n\nThe visit was also condemned by the Hong Kong government, which said that it was a \"serious challenge\" to the \"one country, two systems\" principle. The Hong Kong foreign ministry also called on the international community to respect China's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\n### Sanctions\n\nThe PRC also announced a series of sanctions against Pelosi and her family, including a ban on travel to China and restrictions on business activities. The sanctions were seen as a symbolic gesture, but they also highlighted the PRC's willingness to use economic coercion to achieve its goals.\n\n## International\n\nThe visit received a mixed reaction from the international community. Some countries, including Japan and Australia, expressed support for the visit and praised Pelosi for her leadership. However, other countries, including Russia and Iran, condemned the visit and called on the United States to respect China's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\n### Intergovernmental organizations\n\nThe United Nations also issued a statement on the visit, calling on all parties to avoid actions that could escalate tensions. The statement also emphasized the need for calm and restraint, and called on all parties to respect the principles of sovereignty and non-interference.\n\n### Nations\n\nThe European Union also issued a statement on the visit, calling on all parties to avoid actions that could escalate tensions. The statement also emphasized the need for calm and restraint, and called on all parties to respect the principles of sovereignty and non-interference.\n\n# Interpretations and popular response\n\nThe visit was widely seen as a significant escalation of tensions between the United States and China, and had far-reaching implications for international relations and global geopolitics. Many analysts saw the visit as a demonstration of the United States' commitment to its allies and partners in the region, as well as its willingness to challenge China's growing influence.\n\nThe visit also sparked a significant reaction on social media, with many people praising Pelosi for her leadership and commitment to democracy and human rights. However, others criticized the visit, arguing that it was provocative and could escalate tensions with China.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe visit had significant consequences for international relations and global geopolitics. The PRC's military exercises around Taiwan were seen as a demonstration of its military capabilities, and highlighted the need for increased cooperation between the United States and its allies and partners in the region.\n\nThe visit also highlighted the need for a more nuanced and sophisticated approach to China, one that takes into account its growing influence and its willingness to challenge the existing international order. Many analysts argued that the visit marked a significant turning point in the United States-China relationship, and that it would have far-reaching implications for international relations and global geopolitics.\n\n# See also\n\n* Cross-Strait relations\n* One-China policy\n* Taiwan Relations Act\n* United States-Taiwan relations\n* People's Republic of China – United States relations\n\n# Notes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_visit_by_Nancy_Pelosi_to_Taiwan\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Visit\n#Reactions\n##United States\n##People's Republic of China\n###Hong Kong\n###Sanctions\n##International\n###Intergovernmental organizations\n###Nations\n#Interpretations and popular response\n#Aftermath\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
