The storm brought significant rainfall, strong winds, and storm surges to Japan, the Korean Peninsula, and other areas, causing widespread disruptions and damage.\n\n# Meteorological history\n\nTyphoon Khanun originated from a tropical disturbance that formed in the western Pacific Ocean on July 15, 2023. The disturbance gradually intensified as it moved northwestward, fueled by warm ocean waters and low wind shear. On July 17, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded the system to a tropical depression, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) followed suit several hours later.\n\nAs the system continued to strengthen, it developed a well-defined circulation center and a symmetrical cloud pattern. On July 18, the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm and assigned it the name Khanun, which means \"jackfruit\" in Thai. The JTWC also upgraded the system to a tropical storm, with maximum sustained winds of 65 km/h (40 mph).\n\nKhanun continued to intensify over the next few days, with its winds increasing to 120 km/h (75 mph) on July 20. The storm's central pressure dropped to 965 hPa (28.5 inHg), making it a severe tropical storm. On July 21, Khanun reached its peak intensity, with maximum sustained winds of 140 km/h (85 mph) and a central pressure of 955 hPa (28.2 inHg).\n\n# Preparations, impact, and aftermath\n\n## Japan\n\nKhanun brought significant rainfall to Japan, particularly in the western and central regions. The Japan Meteorological Agency issued heavy rain warnings for several prefectures, including Osaka, Hyogo, and Kyoto. The warnings were later upgraded to emergency warnings, which are issued when there is a high risk of flooding, landslides, and other disasters.\n\nThe storm caused widespread disruptions in Japan, with over 100 flights canceled and several train services suspended. The Japan Railways Group reported that several train lines were closed due to flooding and landslides. The storm also caused power outages, with over 10,000 households affected.\n\nThe Japanese government deployed troops to assist with relief efforts, and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism issued a statement urging people to take necessary precautions. The government also set up emergency shelters for people who were forced to evacuate their homes.\n\n## Korean Peninsula\n\nKhanun brought strong winds and heavy rainfall to the Korean Peninsula, particularly in South Korea. The Korea Meteorological Administration issued a typhoon warning for several provinces, including Jeju Island, South Jeolla, and North Jeolla.\n\nThe storm caused significant damage in South Korea, with over 100 homes destroyed and several thousand households affected by power outages. The storm also caused flooding in several areas, including the city of Busan, where several hundred people were forced to evacuate their homes.\n\nIn North Korea, the storm caused significant damage to crops and infrastructure, according to reports from the state-run Korean Central News Agency. The agency reported that several thousand homes were damaged or destroyed, and several hundred people were forced to evacuate their homes.\n\n## Elsewhere\n\nKhanun also brought significant rainfall to Taiwan, where several people were forced to evacuate their homes due to flooding. The storm caused widespread disruptions in China, particularly in the provinces of Fujian and Jiangxi, where several flights were canceled and several train services were suspended.\n\nThe storm also brought strong winds and heavy rainfall to the Philippines, where several people were forced to evacuate their homes due to flooding. The storm caused significant damage to crops and infrastructure, according to reports from the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of tropical cyclones in 2023\n* Typhoon season\n* Tropical cyclone\n\n# References\n\n*Note: This section is intentionally left blank as per the requirements*\n\n# External links\n\n*Note: This section is intentionally left blank as per the requirements*", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Typhoon_Khanun_(2023)\" following this outline:\n\n#Meteorological history\n#Preparations, impact, and aftermath\n##Japan\n##Korean Peninsula\n##Elsewhere\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The operation aimed to retake control of the Kharkiv Oblast, which had been occupied by Russian forces since the early stages of the conflict. The counteroffensive was a significant turning point in the war, marking a major shift in momentum in favor of Ukraine.\n\n# Background\n\nThe Kharkiv Oblast, located in northeastern Ukraine, had been under Russian occupation since February 2022. The region's capital, Kharkiv, had been subject to intense shelling and bombardment, causing significant damage to infrastructure and civilian casualties. The Ukrainian military had been planning a counterattack for months, gathering intelligence and mobilizing resources for a large-scale operation.\n\n# Prelude\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the counteroffensive, Ukrainian forces conducted a series of small-scale attacks and reconnaissance missions to test Russian defenses and gather intelligence. These operations allowed Ukrainian commanders to identify vulnerabilities in the Russian lines and plan a more effective attack.\n\n# Counteroffensive\n\n## First phase (6–12 September 2022)\n\n### Initial advance\n\nOn 6 September 2022, Ukrainian forces launched a major attack on Russian positions in the Kharkiv Oblast. The initial advance focused on the area around the town of Balakliia, where Ukrainian forces quickly broke through Russian defenses. The attack was supported by artillery and air strikes, which targeted Russian command centers and logistics hubs.\n\n### Breakthrough\n\nAs the Ukrainian advance gathered momentum, Russian forces began to retreat from their positions. On 8 September, Ukrainian forces broke through the Russian lines near the town of Shevchenkove, opening a gap in the Russian defenses. The breakthrough allowed Ukrainian forces to pour into the gap, pushing Russian forces back and creating a large-scale rout.\n\n### Russian withdrawal from Kharkiv Oblast west of Oskil River\n\nAs the Ukrainian advance continued, Russian forces began to withdraw from the Kharkiv Oblast west of the Oskil River. The withdrawal was chaotic, with Russian troops abandoning equipment and supplies as they retreated. Ukrainian forces pursued the retreating Russians, capturing large quantities of equipment and supplies.\n\n### Other gains and casualties\n\nDuring the first phase of the counteroffensive, Ukrainian forces made significant gains, retaking control of several towns and villages. The operation also resulted in significant casualties on both sides, with estimates suggesting that hundreds of Russian soldiers were killed or wounded.\n\n## Battle of Shevchenkove\n\nThe battle of Shevchenkove was a key engagement during the first phase of the counteroffensive. Ukrainian forces launched a major attack on the town, which was defended by a large Russian garrison. The battle was intense, with both sides suffering heavy casualties. Ultimately, Ukrainian forces emerged victorious, capturing the town and securing a key victory.\n\n## Second phase (13 September–1 October 2022)\n\n### Oskil River crossing\n\nOn 13 September, Ukrainian forces launched a major attack on Russian positions east of the Oskil River. The operation aimed to capture the town of Lyman, which was a key Russian stronghold. Ukrainian forces successfully crossed the river, using pontoon bridges and amphibious vehicles to establish a foothold on the eastern bank.\n\n### Encirclement and recapture of Lyman\n\nAs Ukrainian forces advanced on Lyman, they encircled the town, cutting off Russian supply lines and escape routes. The Russian garrison was quickly overwhelmed, and on 1 October, Ukrainian forces recaptured the town.

The coup led to the overthrow of President Mohamed Bazoum, who had been in office since 2021. The events surrounding the coup were marked by a series of military mobilizations, announcements, and reactions from domestic and international actors.\n\n#Background\n\nNiger, a landlocked country in West Africa, has a history of political instability and military interventions. Since gaining independence from France in 1960, the country has experienced four successful coups and several attempted takeovers. The most recent coup before 2023 occurred in 2010, when a military junta overthrew President Mamadou Tandja.\n\nIn 2021, Mohamed Bazoum, a former interior minister, won the presidential election, succeeding President Mahamadou Issoufou. Bazoum's presidency was marked by efforts to address the country's security challenges, including the threat posed by Islamist militant groups in the Sahel region.\n\nHowever, Bazoum's government faced criticism for its handling of the economy and allegations of corruption. The country's security situation also remained precarious, with frequent attacks by militant groups.\n\n#Events\n\n##26 July\n\n###Bazoum's Detention\n\nOn the morning of 26 July 2023, President Bazoum was detained by a group of military officers at the presidential palace in Niamey, the capital city. The exact circumstances surrounding his detention were unclear, but reports suggested that the military had been planning the move for some time.\n\n###Military Mobilization\n\nFollowing Bazoum's detention, military units began mobilizing in Niamey and other major cities across the country. Armored vehicles and troops were deployed in key locations, including government buildings, roads, and bridges.\n\n###Announcement of Bazoum's Overthrow\n\nIn the evening of 26 July, a group of military officers appeared on national television to announce the overthrow of President Bazoum. The officers, who identified themselves as members of the National Council for the Safeguard of the Homeland (CNSP), stated that Bazoum's government had failed to address the country's security and economic challenges.\n\n##27 July\n\n###Bazoum's Response\n\nOn 27 July, President Bazoum released a statement condemning the coup and calling on the military to return to their barracks. Bazoum also appealed to the international community to support him in his efforts to restore democracy in Niger.\n\n###Military Recognition of the Junta\n\nDespite Bazoum's statement, the military continued to consolidate its control over the country. The CNSP, now recognized as the ruling authority, began to establish a new government structure, with military officers taking key positions.\n\n##28 July\n\nThe CNSP announced the establishment of a transitional government, with a new prime minister and cabinet. The junta also promised to hold elections within a specified timeframe, although the exact date was not disclosed.\n\n#Aftermath\n\nThe aftermath of the coup saw a mix of reactions from domestic and international actors. While some Nigeriens welcomed the change, others expressed concerns about the implications of the military takeover.\n\nThe CNSP, now in control of the government, began to implement its agenda, including efforts to address the country's security and economic challenges. However, the junta's actions were closely watched by the international community, which was wary of the implications of the coup for democracy and stability in the region.\n\n#Reactions\n\n##Domestic\n\nThe domestic reaction to the coup was divided. Some Nigeriens, frustrated with the government's handling of the economy and security, welcomed the change. Others, however, expressed concerns about the implications of the military takeover for democracy and stability.\n\nThe opposition parties, which had been critical of Bazoum's government, were divided in their response to the coup. Some parties condemned the military takeover, while others saw it as an opportunity to push for reforms.\n\n##International\n\nThe international community reacted with caution to the coup. The United Nations, the African Union, and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) all condemned the military takeover and called for the restoration of democracy.\n\nThe United States, the European Union, and other major powers also expressed concerns about the implications of the coup for stability in the region. The international community, however, stopped short of imposing sanctions or taking more drastic measures, preferring to engage in diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis.\n\n#Analysis\n\nThe 2023 Nigerien coup d'état was a complex event with multiple factors contributing to its outcome.

The rebellion was sparked by long-standing tensions between the Wagner Group's leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, and the Russian military and government.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\n### Yevgeny Prigozhin and the Wagner Group\n\nYevgeny Prigozhin is a Russian businessman and mercenary leader who founded the Wagner Group in 2014. The group is a private military company that has been involved in various conflicts, including the Syrian Civil War and the War in Donbas. Prigozhin has been closely tied to Russian President Vladimir Putin and has been accused of acting as a proxy for the Russian government in various conflicts.\n\n### Internal tensions during the invasion of Ukraine\n\nDuring the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Wagner Group played a significant role in the conflict, with many of its fighters deployed to the front lines. However, internal tensions began to rise within the group as Prigozhin became increasingly frustrated with the Russian military's handling of the war. Prigozhin publicly criticized the Russian Defense Ministry and accused them of incompetence and corruption.\n\n### Order to integrate Wagner\n\nIn April 2023, the Russian government ordered the Wagner Group to integrate with the Russian military, a move that Prigozhin saw as an attempt to bring his group under greater government control. Prigozhin refused to comply with the order, citing concerns about the group's autonomy and the potential for his fighters to be used as cannon fodder.\n\n### Planning the rebellion\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the rebellion, Prigozhin began to secretly plan an uprising against the Russian government. He reportedly met with other dissatisfied military leaders and began to mobilize his fighters in preparation for a potential conflict.\n\nRebellion\n----------\n\n### Prigozhin's statements\n\nOn June 23, 2023, Prigozhin released a statement in which he publicly rebuked the Russian government and accused them of attacking the Wagner Group. He also called for a rebellion against the government, citing its corruption and incompetence.\n\n### Call to rebellion\n\nPrigozhin's statement was seen as a call to arms by many of his supporters, and soon after, Wagner Group fighters began to mobilize and move towards key government targets. The group's fighters were well-trained and well-equipped, and they quickly overran several key military bases and government installations.\n\n### Capture of Rostov-on-Don\n\nOn June 24, 2023, Wagner Group fighters captured the city of Rostov-on-Don, a key military hub in southern Russia. The city was home to several important military bases, including the Southern Military District headquarters.\n\n### Advance towards Moscow\n\nAfter capturing Rostov-on-Don, the Wagner Group fighters began to advance towards Moscow, the Russian capital. The group's fighters moved quickly, using their superior training and equipment to outmaneuver government forces.\n\n### Security measures\n\nAs the rebellion gained momentum, the Russian government implemented strict security measures in an attempt to quell the uprising. Moscow was placed under martial law, and government forces were deployed to key intersections and government buildings.\n\n### Events in Syria\n\nThe rebellion also had an impact on the Syrian Civil War, where the Wagner Group had been involved in fighting on behalf of the Syrian government. As the rebellion began, the group's fighters in Syria began to defect to the opposition, further destabilizing the conflict.\n\nResolution\n----------\n\nAfter several days of intense fighting, the rebellion was eventually put down by government forces. The Wagner Group's fighters were forced to retreat, and Prigozhin went into hiding.\n\nReactions\n----------\n\n### Domestic\n\n#### Vladimir Putin's address\n\nOn June 25, 2023, Russian President Vladimir Putin addressed the nation, condemning the rebellion and promising to take action against those responsible. Putin's address was seen as an attempt to reassure the public and stabilize the situation.\n\n#### Other government-aligned figures\n\nOther government-aligned figures, including Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and National Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev, also condemned the rebellion and pledged to take action against the Wagner Group.\n\n#### Anti-war opposition and anti-government armed groups\n\nThe rebellion was also condemned by anti-war opposition groups and anti-government armed groups, who saw the uprising as a threat to stability and democracy.\n\n#### Ultranationalists and milbloggers\n\nUltranationalists and milbloggers, who had previously supported the Wagner Group, were divided in their response to the rebellion. Some condemned the uprising, while others saw it as a justified response to government corruption and incompetence.\n\n#### Wider public\n\nThe wider public was largely shocked and confused by the rebellion, with many people unsure of what to make of the sudden outbreak of violence.\n\n### International\n\nThe international community was also shocked by the rebellion, with many countries expressing concern about the potential for instability and conflict in Russia.\n\nAftermath\n----------\n\n### Fallout and restoring order\n\nIn the aftermath of the rebellion, the Russian government worked to restore order and stability. Government forces were deployed to key cities, and a number of arrested were made in connection with the uprising.\n\n### Subsequent statements\n\nPrigozhin released several statements in the aftermath of the rebellion, in which he continued to criticize the Russian government and blame them for the uprising.\n\n### Fate of the Wagner Group and Yevgeny Prigozhin\n\nThe fate of the Wagner Group and Yevgeny Prigozhin remained uncertain in the aftermath of the rebellion. The group's fighters were forced to go into hiding, and Prigozhin's whereabouts were unknown.\n\n#### Closure of criminal case and initial statements\n\nIn July 2023, the Russian government announced the closure of a criminal case against Prigozhin and the Wagner Group, citing a lack of evidence. Prigozhin released a statement in response, in which he denied any wrongdoing and blamed the government for the rebellion.\n\n#### Crackdown on Wagner, alleged purges and related arrests\n\nDespite the closure of the criminal case, the Russian government continued to crackdown on the Wagner Group, with reports of alleged purges and related arrests.\n\n#### Prigozhin's return to Russia\n\nIn August 2023, Prigozhin returned to Russia, where he was met by government officials and reportedly offered a deal to cooperate with the authorities.\n\n#### Death of Prigozhin and Utkin\n\nOn August 23, 2023, Prigozhin and several other high-ranking Wagner Group officials, including Dmitry Utkin, were killed in a plane crash in Russia. The cause of the crash was unclear, with some speculating that it may have been an assassination.\n\n### Measures of NATO countries\n\nIn response to the rebellion, NATO countries implemented a number of measures to increase security and cooperation. The alliance also condemned the uprising and pledged to support the Russian government in its efforts to restore stability.\n\nAnalysis\n----------\n\n### Political\n\nThe rebellion highlighted the deep divisions within the Russian government and the growing discontent among certain segments of the population. The uprising also raised questions about the stability of the Russian government and the potential for future conflict.\n\n### Military\n\nThe rebellion also highlighted the military capabilities of the Wagner Group and the potential for private military companies to play a significant role in future conflicts.\n\nSee also\n----------\n\n* Wagner Group\n* Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* Syrian Civil War\n* Private military company\n\nNotes\n------\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nExternal links\n--------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Wagner_Group_rebellion\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Yevgeny Prigozhin and the Wagner Group\n##Internal tensions during the invasion of Ukraine\n###Order to integrate Wagner\n##Planning the rebellion\n#Rebellion\n##Prigozhin's statements\n###Rebukes of the government and allegation of an attack on Wagner\n###Call to rebellion\n##Capture of Rostov-on-Don\n##Advance towards Moscow\n##Security measures\n##Events in Syria\n#Resolution\n#Reactions\n##Domestic\n###Vladimir Putin's address\n###Other government-aligned figures\n###Anti-war opposition and anti-government armed groups\n###Ultranationalists and milbloggers\n###Wider public\n##International\n#Aftermath\n##Fallout and restoring order\n##Subsequent statements\n##Fate of the Wagner Group and Yevgeny Prigozhin\n###Closure of criminal case and initial statements\n###Crackdown on Wagner, alleged purges and related arrests\n###Prigozhin's return to Russia\n###Death of Prigozhin and Utkin\n##Measures of NATO countries\n#Analysis\n##Political\n##Military\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The nonmetals are located in the upper right corner of the periodic table and include a wide range of elements, from the noble gases to the halogens and other unclassified nonmetals. In this article, we will explore the definition and properties of nonmetals, their types, abundance, extraction, and uses, as well as the taxonomical history of nonmetal classification.\n\nDefinition and Applicable Elements\n---------------------------------\n\nNonmetals are a class of chemical elements that are typically defined as those that do not exhibit the characteristic properties of metals. These elements are typically located in the upper right corner of the periodic table and include the noble gases, halogens, and other unclassified nonmetals. The nonmetals are generally characterized by their inability to exhibit the following properties:\n\n* Luster: Nonmetals tend to be dull and lack the shiny appearance of metals.\n* Malleability: Nonmetals are typically brittle and cannot be hammered or shaped like metals.\n* Conductivity: Nonmetals are generally poor conductors of electricity and heat.\n* Reactivity: Nonmetals tend to be less reactive than metals and do not readily form ions.\n\nThe nonmetals include a wide range of elements, from the noble gases (Group 18) to the halogens (Group 17) and other unclassified nonmetals, such as carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur, and selenium.\n\nGeneral Properties\n-----------------\n\n### Physical\n\nNonmetals tend to exhibit a range of physical properties that distinguish them from metals. Some of the key physical properties of nonmetals include:\n\n* Appearance: Nonmetals tend to be dull and lack the shiny appearance of metals.\n* Density: Nonmetals tend to be less dense than metals.\n* Melting and boiling points: Nonmetals tend to have lower melting and boiling points than metals.\n* Solubility: Nonmetals tend to be less soluble in water than metals.\n\n#### Allotropes\n\nSome nonmetals, such as carbon and sulfur, can exist in multiple allotropes, which are different physical forms of the same element. For example, carbon can exist as diamond, graphite, and fullerenes, while sulfur can exist as orthorhombic and monoclinic crystals.\n\n### Chemical\n\nNonmetals tend to exhibit a range of chemical properties that distinguish them from metals. Some of the key chemical properties of nonmetals include:\n\n* Reactivity: Nonmetals tend to be less reactive than metals and do not readily form ions.\n* Valency: Nonmetals tend to have a fixed valency, which is the number of electrons an atom can gain or lose to form ions.\n* Chemical bonding: Nonmetals tend to form covalent bonds, which involve the sharing of electrons between atoms.\n\n### Complications\n\nThere are several complications that can arise when trying to classify nonmetals. Some of the key complications include:\n\n#### First Row Anomaly\n\nThe first row of the periodic table, which includes hydrogen, helium, and lithium, exhibits a range of anomalies that can make it difficult to classify these elements as metals or nonmetals. For example, hydrogen can exhibit both metallic and nonmetallic properties, depending on the circumstances.\n\n#### Secondary Periodicity\n\nThe periodic table exhibits secondary periodicity, which is the tendency of elements to exhibit similar properties at regular intervals. This can make it difficult to classify nonmetals, as some elements may exhibit properties that are similar to those of metals.\n\n#### Higher Oxidation States\n\nSome nonmetals, such as phosphorus and sulfur, can exhibit higher oxidation states than others. This can make it difficult to classify these elements, as they may exhibit properties that are similar to those of metals.\n\n#### Multiple Bond Formation\n\nSome nonmetals, such as carbon and nitrogen, can form multiple bonds with other atoms. This can make it difficult to classify these elements, as they may exhibit properties that are similar to those of metals.\n\n#### Property Overlaps\n\nThere can be overlaps between the properties of metals and nonmetals, which can make it difficult to classify certain elements. For example, some nonmetals, such as boron and silicon, can exhibit properties that are similar to those of metals.\n\nTypes\n-----\n\n### Noble Gases\n\nThe noble gases are a group of nonmetals that are located in Group 18 of the periodic table. They are characterized by their inability to react with other elements and their tendency to exist as monatomic gases. The noble gases include:\n\n* Helium (He)\n* Neon (Ne)\n* Argon (Ar)\n* Krypton (Kr)\n* Xenon (Xe)\n* Radon (Rn)\n\n### Halogen Nonmetals\n\nThe halogen nonmetals are a group of nonmetals that are located in Group 17 of the periodic table. They are characterized by their tendency to readily form ions and their reactivity with other elements. The halogen nonmetals include:\n\n* Fluorine (F)\n* Chlorine (Cl)\n* Bromine (Br)\n* Iodine (I)\n* Astatine (At)\n\n### Unclassified Nonmetals\n\nThere are several nonmetals that do not fit into any of the above categories. These elements are often referred to as unclassified nonmetals and include:\n\n* Carbon (C)\n* Nitrogen (N)\n* Oxygen (O)\n* Phosphorus (P)\n* Sulfur (S)\n* Selenium (Se)\n\nAbundance, Extraction, and Uses\n--------------------------------\n\n### Abundance\n\nNonmetals are abundant in the Earth's crust and can be found in a wide range of minerals and rocks. Some of the most abundant nonmetals include oxygen, silicon, and aluminum.\n\n### Extraction\n\nNonmetals can be extracted from a wide range of sources, including minerals, rocks, and atmospheric gases. Some of the most common methods of extraction include:\n\n* Mining: Nonmetals can be extracted from minerals and rocks through mining.\n* Refining: Nonmetals can be refined from impure sources through refining processes.\n* Distillation: Nonmetals can be distilled from atmospheric gases through distillation processes.\n\n### Uses\n\nNonmetals have a wide range of uses, including:\n\n* Electronics: Nonmetals are used in a wide range of electronic devices, including computers, smartphones, and televisions.\n* Construction: Nonmetals are used in construction materials, such as glass, ceramics, and concrete.\n* Energy: Nonmetals are used in energy production, including solar panels and fuel cells.\n\nTaxonomical History\n-------------------\n\n### Background\n\nThe classification of nonmetals has a long and complex history. The earliest classification systems were based on the physical properties of elements, such as their appearance and reactivity.\n\n### Organization of Elements by Types\n\nThe modern periodic table was developed in the 19th century and is based on the organization of elements by their atomic number and chemical properties. The nonmetals are located in the upper right corner of the periodic table and are characterized by their inability to exhibit the characteristic properties of metals.\n\n### Development of Types\n\nThe development of nonmetal types has been an ongoing process, with new types being discovered and classified over time. Some of the most significant developments include the discovery of the noble gases and the halogen nonmetals.\n\n### Suggested Distinguishing Criteria\n\nThere have been several suggested distinguishing criteria for nonmetals, including:\n\n* Atomic number: Nonmetals tend to have higher atomic numbers than metals.\n* Electron configuration: Nonmetals tend to have full outer energy levels, which makes them less reactive than metals.\n* Chemical reactivity: Nonmetals tend to be less reactive than metals and do not readily form ions.\n\nComparison of Selected Properties\n---------------------------------\n\n### Physical Properties by Element Type\n\n| Element Type | Density (g/cm³) | Melting Point (°C) | Boiling Point (°C) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Noble Gases | 0.178-5.9 | -272-121 | -271-58 |\n| Halogen Nonmetals | 1.5-6.2 | -222-114 | -188-58 |\n| Unclassified Nonmetals | 1.8-5.3 | -222-365 | -185-445 |\n\n### Chemical Properties by Element Type\n\n| Element Type | Reactivity | Valency | Chemical Bonding |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Noble Gases | Low | 0 | Covalent |\n| Halogen Nonmetals | High | 1 | Covalent/Ionic |\n| Unclassified Nonmetals | Medium | 2-4 | Covalent |\n\nSee Also\n--------\n\n* Metal\n* Metalloid\n* Periodic Table\n\nNotes\n-----\n\n* This article is a general overview of nonmetals and is not intended to be a comprehensive treatment of the subject.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n* Bibliography:\n\t+ Atkins, P.

Grusch's claims have garnered significant attention from the media, government officials, and the general public.\n\n#Background\n\nDavid Grusch served in the USAF from 2009 to 2019, during which he held various intelligence positions, including working with the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). After leaving the military, Grusch began to publicly discuss his alleged experiences with UAP, claiming that he had access to sensitive information and had worked on projects related to the study of these phenomena.\n\n#Grusch's Public Claims\n\nGrusch's claims center around his alleged involvement in a secret government program dedicated to the study of UAP. He asserts that he worked with a team of analysts and scientists to investigate reports of UAP sightings and that he had access to classified information about the program. Grusch claims that the program was focused on understanding the origins and intentions of the UAP, and that he was part of a team that was working to develop strategies for engaging with these phenomena.\n\nGrusch has also claimed that he witnessed firsthand evidence of UAP, including videos and photographs, which he asserts are of unknown origin. He has described the UAP as \"unusual\" and \"unlike anything\" he had seen before, and has stated that he believes they may be of extraterrestrial origin.\n\n#Response from Relevant Experts\n\nMany experts in the fields of astrobiology, astrophysics, and Ufology have expressed skepticism about Grusch's claims. They point out that there is currently no scientific evidence to support the existence of extraterrestrial life, and that most reported UAP sightings can be explained by natural phenomena or human error.\n\nSome experts have also raised concerns about the lack of concrete evidence to support Grusch's claims, and have questioned the validity of his assertions about the government's involvement in UAP research. They argue that if such a program existed, it would likely be subject to intense scrutiny and oversight, and that it is unlikely that a single individual would have access to such sensitive information.\n\n#United States Government Responses\n\n##Department of Defense and NASA Statements\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) and NASA have both issued statements in response to Grusch's claims. The DoD has stated that it has no knowledge of any secret program dedicated to the study of UAP, and that all of its research and development activities are subject to strict oversight and review. NASA has also stated that it has no evidence to support the existence of extraterrestrial life, and that its research is focused on understanding the origins of the universe and the search for life beyond Earth.\n\n##Congressional Action and Comments from Members\n\nSeveral members of Congress have commented on Grusch's claims, with some expressing skepticism and others calling for further investigation. In 2022, the Senate Intelligence Committee held a hearing on UAP, during which several witnesses, including Grusch, testified about their experiences.\n\n##2023 House Committee Oversight and Accountability Hearing\n\nIn 2023, the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability held a hearing on UAP, during which Grusch testified about his claims. The hearing was widely publicized, and Grusch's testimony was subject to intense scrutiny. Several members of the committee expressed skepticism about Grusch's claims, and questioned the validity of his assertions about the government's involvement in UAP research.\n\n#Sean Kirkpatrick\n\nSean Kirkpatrick, a former Pentagon official, has been linked to Grusch's claims. Kirkpatrick worked on the Pentagon's Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP), which was dedicated to the study of UAP. Grusch has claimed that he worked with Kirkpatrick on the program, and that Kirkpatrick was involved in the development of strategies for engaging with UAP.\n\nHowever, Kirkpatrick has denied any involvement in a secret government program dedicated to the study of UAP, and has stated that AATIP was focused on identifying and analyzing potential threats to national security, rather than investigating reports of UAP sightings.\n\n#Media Reporting on Grusch's Claims\n\n##Connections to Studies Funded by Robert Bigelow\n\nSeveral media outlets have reported on connections between Grusch's claims and studies funded by Robert Bigelow, a billionaire entrepreneur who has been involved in the study of UAP. Bigelow's company, Bigelow Aerospace, has funded several studies on UAP, and Grusch has claimed that he worked with Bigelow on some of these projects.\n\n##Reporting on Psychiatric Treatment Received by Grusch\n\nSome media outlets have reported on Grusch's receipt of psychiatric treatment, which has been linked to his claims about UAP. Grusch has stated that he received treatment for anxiety and depression, and that his experiences with UAP were a factor in his decision to seek treatment.\n\n##News Stories and Commentary\n\nGrusch's claims have been the subject of numerous news stories and commentary pieces. Many media outlets have expressed skepticism about Grusch's claims, and have questioned the validity of his assertions about the government's involvement in UAP research.\n\n##Disinformation Campaign Allegations from Media Pundits\n\nSome media pundits have alleged that Grusch's claims are part of a disinformation campaign aimed at misleading the public about the government's involvement in UAP research. They point out that Grusch's claims are often vague and lack concrete evidence, and that they may be intended to create confusion and uncertainty about the issue.\n\n##Additional Responses from Media Pundits\n\nOther media pundits have responded to Grusch's claims by calling for further investigation and transparency about the government's involvement in UAP research. They argue that the public has a right to know about any government programs or activities related to UAP, and that Grusch's claims should be taken seriously.\n\n#See Also\n\n* Unidentified Aerial Phenomena\n* Unidentified Flying Objects\n* Robert Bigelow\n* Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program\n* Defense Intelligence Agency\n\n#References\n\n*Note: This article does not include citations or references, as per the requirements.*\n\n#External Links\n\n*Note: This article does not include external links, as per the requirements.*", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"David_Grusch_UFO_whistleblower_claims\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Grusch's public claims\n#Response from relevant experts\n#United States government responses\n##Department of Defense and NASA statements\n##Congressional action and comments from members\n##2023 House Committee Oversight and Accountability hearing\n#Sean Kirkpatrick\n#Media reporting on Grusch's claims\n##Connections to studies funded by Robert Bigelow\n##Reporting on psychiatric treatment received by Grusch\n##News stories and commentary\n##Disinformation campaign allegations from media pundits\n##Additional responses from media pundits\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The album is the sequel to West's 2021 album Donda, and features a more experimental and avant-garde sound.\n\nBackground and recording\n------------------------\n\nDonda 2 was recorded in the aftermath of the release of Donda, with West working on new material in various locations, including Los Angeles, Miami, and Paris. The album was produced in a relatively short period of time, with West working with a range of collaborators, including producers, songwriters, and musicians.\n\nAccording to reports, West began working on Donda 2 in the summer of 2021, shortly after the release of Donda. The album was initially intended to be a more commercial and radio-friendly follow-up to Donda, but as the recording process progressed, West became increasingly experimental and avant-garde in his approach.\n\nMusic and themes\n-----------------\n\nDonda 2 is characterized by its use of electronic and industrial sounds, as well as its incorporation of elements of hip hop, rock, and gospel music. The album features a range of guests, including rappers, singers, and musicians, and includes lyrics that explore themes of love, family, and spirituality.\n\nThe album's sound is notable for its use of distortion and other audio effects, which give the music a harsh, abrasive quality. The lyrics are often introspective and personal, with West exploring themes of relationships, family, and his own mental health.\n\nSongs\n------\n\n### Official releases\n\nSeveral songs from Donda 2 were released as singles or promotional tracks in the lead-up to the album's release.

The album holds a Metacritic score of 73 out of 100, based on 22 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\nSome critics praised the album's ambition and creativity, while others found the sound to be too abrasive or challenging. Rolling Stone praised the album's \" wild, free-associative genius\", while Pitchfork described it as \" a fascinating, often brilliant mess\".\n\nCommercial performance\n----------------------\n\nDonda 2 debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart, with sales of over 100,000 copies in its first week. The album also reached number one on the UK Albums Chart and the Australian Albums Chart.\n\nThe album's commercial performance was notable for the fact that it was released exclusively through West's website and the Stem Player, without the support of traditional music streaming services.\n\nTrack listing\n-------------\n\n1. \"Eazy\"\n2. \"City of Gods\"\n3. \"True Love\"\n4. \"Jail Pt 2\"\n5. \"Donda\"\n6. \"24\"\n7. \"Angel Pt 2\"\n8. \"Remote Control Pt 2\"\n9. \"Never Abandon Your Family\"\n10. \"God Breathed\"\n11. \"Jonah\"\n12. \"We Did It Kid\"\n13. \"I'm Finna Love Me\"\n14. \"God's Country\"\n15. \"Junya Pt 2\"\n16. \"Junya\"\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nDonda 2 is notable for its use of experimental production techniques and its incorporation of elements of electronic and industrial music.

The storm brought severe winds, heavy rainfall, and significant disruption to several countries, resulting in widespread damage and loss of life.\n\nMeteorology\n------------\n\nStorm Eunice was a complex low-pressure system that developed over the North Atlantic Ocean on February 16, 2022. The storm rapidly intensified as it moved northeastwards, fueled by a strong jet stream and a deepening low-pressure system. Eunice's central pressure dropped to a minimum of 960 hPa (28.35 inHg) on February 18, making it one of the lowest-pressure systems to affect Europe in recent years.\n\nAs the storm approached the European coastline, it began to take on a more northerly track, bringing severe winds and heavy rainfall to the western and central parts of the continent. The storm's strong winds were caused by a combination of the low-pressure system and a strong high-pressure system to the east, which created a tight pressure gradient and resulting in sustained winds of over 100 km/h (62 mph) in many areas.\n\nImpact\n--------\n\nThe impact of Storm Eunice was felt across several countries in Western and Central Europe, with the worst effects experienced in the UK, Netherlands, Germany, and Poland.\n\n### Belgium\n\nIn Belgium, Storm Eunice brought strong winds and heavy rainfall, causing widespread disruption and damage. The storm's strong winds resulted in numerous power outages, with over 100,000 households left without electricity at the peak of the storm. Several buildings were damaged, including a historic windmill in the province of East Flanders.\n\n### Czech Republic\n\nThe Czech Republic experienced severe winds and heavy rainfall, with the worst effects felt in the western part of the country. The storm's strong winds resulted in several power outages, with over 10,000 households left without electricity. Several buildings were damaged, including a historic castle in the city of Karlovy Vary.\n\n### Denmark\n\nDenmark experienced strong winds and heavy rainfall, with the worst effects felt in the western part of the country. The storm's strong winds resulted in several power outages, with over 5,000 households left without electricity.

The riots, which began in the Paris suburb of Nanterre, spread to other parts of metropolitan France and overseas territories, resulting in widespread property damage, injuries, and arrests.\n\n# Background\n\n## Killing of Nahel Merzouk\n\nOn June 27, 2023, Nahel Merzouk was shot and killed by a police officer during a traffic stop in the Paris suburb of Nanterre. Merzouk was driving a car with three other passengers when the police officer pulled them over. According to eyewitnesses, the officer opened fire on the vehicle after Merzouk allegedly tried to flee the scene. Merzouk died shortly after arrival at the hospital. The incident sparked widespread outrage and protests in the community, with many accusing the police of racial profiling and brutality.\n\n## 2017 law concerning traffic stops\n\nIn 2017, France passed a law that allowed police officers to use their discretion when conducting traffic stops. The law was intended to reduce the number of checks on minority communities, who were disproportionately targeted by police. However, critics argued that the law did not go far enough to address the issue of racial profiling and that it gave police officers too much leeway to discriminate.\n\n## Civil unrest related to policing\n\nThe Nahel Merzouk riots were not an isolated incident of civil unrest related to policing in France. In recent years, there have been several high-profile cases of police brutality and racial profiling that have sparked protests and riots. In 2020, the French government passed a law that restricted the right to film police officers, which was widely criticized as an attempt to cover up police misconduct.\n\n## Police brutality in France\n\nPolice brutality is a long-standing issue in France, with many cases of excessive force and violence against minority communities. In 2019, the French government was forced to apologize for the beating of a black man by police officers, which was caught on camera. The incident sparked widespread outrage and calls for greater accountability and reform within the police force.\n\n## Racial profiling and false reporting\n\nRacial profiling is a systemic issue within the French police force, with many officers accused of targeting minority communities. In 2020, a report by the French National Consultative Commission on Human Rights found that people of North African and African descent were 20 times more likely to be stopped by police than white people. The report also found that many police officers falsified reports to justify discriminatory stops.\n\n## Social problems\n\nThe Nahel Merzouk riots were also a symptom of deeper social problems in France, including poverty, unemployment, and social exclusion. Many of the communities affected by the riots were already struggling with high levels of poverty and unemployment, and the killing of Merzouk was seen as a spark that ignited long-simmering tensions.\n\n# Events\n\n## Metropolitan France\n\n### 27–28 June\n\nThe riots began on June 27, 2023, in the Paris suburb of Nanterre, where Merzouk was killed. Protesters clashed with police, who used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the crowd. The riots quickly spread to other parts of the city, including the suburbs of Saint-Denis and Aubervilliers.\n\n### 29–30 June\n\nOn June 29, 2023, the riots intensified, with protesters setting fire to cars and buildings. The police responded with force, using water cannons and batons to disperse the crowd. The riots continued throughout the night, with many areas of the city affected.\n\n### 1–2 July\n\nOn July 1, 2023, the riots spread to other parts of France, including the cities of Lyon and Marseille. Protesters clashed with police, who used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the crowd. The riots continued throughout the night, with many areas of the city affected.\n\n### 3–4 July\n\nOn July 3, 2023, the riots reached their peak, with protesters setting fire to buildings and cars. The police responded with force, using water cannons and batons to disperse the crowd. The riots continued throughout the night, with many areas of the city affected.\n\n### 8 July\n\nOn July 8, 2023, the riots began to subside, with many areas of the city returning to normal. However, tensions remained high, with many protesters vowing to continue their campaign for justice.\n\n### 10 July\n\nOn July 10, 2023, a memorial service was held for Nahel Merzouk, with many protesters and community leaders in attendance. The service was a peaceful and emotional tribute to Merzouk, with many calling for justice and reform.\n\n## Overseas France\n\nThe Nahel Merzouk riots also affected several overseas territories of France, including Guadeloupe and Martinique. Protesters clashed with police, who used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the crowd. The riots continued throughout the night, with many areas of the city affected.\n\n## International\n\nThe Nahel Merzouk riots received international attention, with many countries condemning the police violence and calling for reform. The United Nations issued a statement expressing concern about the situation, while the European Union called for a full investigation into the killing of Merzouk.\n\n# Damage to cultural sites\n\nThe Nahel Merzouk riots resulted in significant damage to cultural sites, including museums, libraries, and historical landmarks. Many of these sites were targeted by protesters, who saw them as symbols of the French state and its institutions.\n\n# Estimated cost of the riots\n\nThe estimated cost of the Nahel Merzouk riots is difficult to quantify, but it is believed to be in the hundreds of millions of euros. Many businesses were affected, with property damage and loss of revenue. The cost of policing and emergency services also added to the total.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## Public officials and media\n\nPublic officials and media outlets were quick to condemn the riots, with many calling for calm and restraint. However, many protesters felt that the government and media were not taking their concerns seriously, and that they were being demonized and stigmatized.\n\n## Police violence\n\nThe police response to the riots was widely criticized, with many accusing officers of using excessive force and violence. Many protesters were injured, and some were arrested and charged with crimes.\n\n## Police revolt\n\nIn the aftermath of the riots, some police officers began to speak out against the government and the police leadership, accusing them of not providing adequate support and resources. The police revolt was a symptom of deeper tensions within the police force, with many officers feeling that they were being scapegoated for the government's failures.\n\n## Misinformation\n\nDuring the riots, there was widespread misinformation and disinformation, with many false reports and rumors circulating on social media. Many protesters and community leaders were accused of spreading false information, while others were accused of manipulating the narrative to suit their own agendas.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of riots and civil unrest in France\n* List of police brutality incidents in France\n* Racial profiling in France\n* Social unrest in France\n* Police reform in France", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Nahel_Merzouk_riots\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Killing of Nahel Merzouk\n##2017 law concerning traffic stops\n##Civil unrest related to policing\n##Police brutality in France\n##Racial profiling and false reporting\n##Social problems\n#Events\n##Metropolitan France\n###27–28 June\n###29–30 June\n###1–2 July\n###3–4 July\n###8 July\n###10 July\n##Overseas France\n##International\n#Damage to cultural sites\n#Estimated cost of the riots\n#Reactions\n##Public officials and media\n##Police violence\n##Police revolt\n##Misinformation\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The path is a popular route for commuters and recreational cyclists, providing a scenic and relatively flat route through the city.\n\n# Route\n\nThe Ballona Creek Bike Path begins at the intersection of Centinela Avenue and Braddock Drive in Del Rey, near the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). From there, it follows the Ballona Creek channel north through the cities of Los Angeles, Culver City, and Marina del Rey, before ending at the Marvin Braude Bike Trail (also known as \"The Strand\") in Playa del Rey.\n\n## Airport\n\nThe bike path's proximity to LAX makes it a convenient option for cyclists traveling to or from the airport. However, cyclists should be aware that the path does not provide direct access to the airport terminals. Instead, it connects to the airport's perimeter roads, allowing cyclists to access the airport's bike parking facilities or connect to other local bike routes.\n\n# Conditions\n\nThe Ballona Creek Bike Path is generally well-maintained and suitable for cyclists of all skill levels. However, there are some conditions that cyclists should be aware of:\n\n## Rest stops\n\nThere are several rest stops and parks along the bike path, providing cyclists with opportunities to rest, picnic, or use public restrooms. Some of these parks also offer drinking fountains, bike racks, and other amenities.\n\n## Homeless camping\n\nUnfortunately, the Ballona Creek Bike Path has struggled with issues related to homeless camping in recent years. In some areas, homeless individuals have set up campsites along the bike path, which can create safety concerns and unsanitary conditions for cyclists and local residents. Efforts have been made to address these issues, including increased police presence and outreach services to connect homeless individuals with social services.\n\n# Access gates\n\nThe Ballona Creek Bike Path has several access gates that allow cyclists to enter or exit the path at various points. These gates are designed to prevent motorized vehicles from entering the path, while allowing cyclists and pedestrians to pass through. However, some of these gates can be narrow or have limited visibility, so cyclists should exercise caution when approaching them.\n\n# History\n\nThe Ballona Creek Bike Path was first proposed in the 1970s as part of a larger effort to develop recreational facilities along the Ballona Creek channel. The path was constructed in several phases, with the first section opening in the early 1980s. Since then, the path has undergone several improvements and expansions, including the addition of new access gates, rest stops, and landscaping.\n\n# Improvements\n\nIn recent years, the Ballona Creek Bike Path has undergone several improvements aimed at enhancing safety and accessibility. These improvements have included:\n\n* Resurfacing and widening of the path to improve visibility and reduce conflicts between cyclists and pedestrians\n* Installation of new signage and striping to clarify path markings and reduce confusion\n* Addition of new access gates and rest stops to improve access and amenities for cyclists\n* Enhanced landscaping and habitat restoration to improve the path's scenic and environmental qualities\n\n# Proposed extensions\n\nThere are several proposed extensions to the Ballona Creek Bike Path, aimed at connecting the path to other local bike routes and improving access to surrounding communities. Some of these proposed extensions include:\n\n* A connection to the Expo Line bike path, which would provide a direct link to downtown Los Angeles and other regional bike routes\n* An extension to the San Gabriel River Trail, which would provide a link to the San Gabriel Mountains and other regional bike routes\n* An extension to the Marvin Braude Bike Trail, which would provide a direct link to the beachfront bike path in Santa Monica and other surrounding communities\n\n# Gallery\n\n[Insert images of the Ballona Creek Bike Path]\n\n# See also\n\n* Marvin Braude Bike Trail\n* Expo Line bike path\n* San Gabriel River Trail\n* Los Angeles International Airport\n* Ballona Creek\n\n# References\n\n[Insert references]\n\n# External links\n\n* Los Angeles County Department of Public Works: Ballona Creek Bike Path\n* City of Los Angeles: Ballona Creek Bike Path\n* Metro: Ballona Creek Bike Path", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Ballona_Creek_Bike_Path\" following this outline:\n\n#Route\n##Airport\n#Conditions\n##Rest stops\n##Homeless camping\n#Access gates\n#History\n#Improvements\n#Proposed extensions\n#Gallery\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The earthquakes were among the deadliest natural disasters in recent history, with thousands of people killed and many more injured or displaced.\n\n# Tectonic Setting\n\n## Geology\n\nThe region affected by the earthquakes is located at the boundary between the Arabian and Anatolian tectonic plates. This boundary is a zone of complex deformation, where the Arabian plate is being pushed northwards into the Anatolian plate. The resulting stress has created a series of faults, including the East Anatolian Fault Zone, which runs for over 500 km (310 miles) across eastern Turkey.\n\n## Seismicity\n\nThe region has a long history of seismic activity, with many significant earthquakes occurring in recent centuries. The East Anatolian Fault Zone is considered one of the most seismically active regions in the world, with frequent earthquakes occurring along its length. The earthquakes that struck in 2023 were not unexpected, given the region's geological history and ongoing tectonic activity.\n\n# Earthquake Sequence\n\n## Aftershocks\n\nThe initial earthquake, which occurred at 04:17 local time on February 6, was followed by numerous aftershocks, including several of significant magnitude. The aftershocks continued for several days, causing further damage and disruption. The most significant aftershock occurred on February 20, with a magnitude of 6.4.\n\n## Seismology\n\nThe earthquakes were characterized by a high level of seismic energy release, with the initial earthquake having a magnitude of 7.8. The earthquakes were shallow, with focal depths of around 10-20 km (6-12 miles), which increased the level of damage and destruction.\n\n## Rupture Propagation\n\nThe earthquakes were caused by rupture along the East Anatolian Fault Zone, with the initial earthquake rupturing a section of the fault approximately 100 km (62 miles) long. The rupture propagation was complex, with multiple branches and segments of the fault being activated.\n\n## Surface Rupture\n\nThe earthquakes caused significant surface rupture, with the ground surface being broken and deformed along the length of the fault. The surface rupture was visible in many areas, with cracks and fissures opening up in the ground.\n\n## Ground Motion\n\nThe earthquakes caused intense ground motion, with peak ground accelerations of up to 1g (9.8 m/s^2) recorded in some areas. The ground motion was strong enough to cause widespread damage and collapse of buildings.\n\n## Geological Effects\n\nThe earthquakes caused significant geological effects, including landslides, soil liquefaction, and changes to the groundwater table. The earthquakes also caused the formation of sand blows and mud volcanoes in some areas.\n\n## Tsunami\n\nThere were reports of a tsunami being triggered by the earthquakes, with waves of up to 1 meter (3.3 feet) high reported in some coastal areas. However, the tsunami was not widespread and did not cause significant damage.\n\n## Effects on Other Faults\n\nThe earthquakes caused stress changes on other faults in the region, including the North Anatolian Fault Zone. The stress changes increased the likelihood of future earthquakes on these faults.\n\n# Damage and Casualties\n\n## In Turkey\n\nThe earthquakes caused widespread destruction in Turkey, with thousands of buildings collapsed or damaged. The city of Kahramanmaraş was particularly affected, with over 80% of buildings destroyed. The earthquakes also caused significant damage to infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and utilities.\n\n## In Syria\n\nThe earthquakes caused significant damage and destruction in Syria, particularly in the northern regions. The city of Aleppo was severely affected, with many buildings collapsed or damaged.\n\n## Foreign Casualties\n\nThere were reports of foreign casualties, particularly among tourists and aid workers. Several countries, including the United States, Russia, and China, reported casualties among their citizens.\n\n## Effects in Other Countries\n\nThe earthquakes were felt in several other countries, including Lebanon, Jordan, and Israel. The earthquakes caused some damage and disruption in these countries, but the effects were generally minor.\n\n## Aftershocks\n\nThe aftershocks caused further damage and disruption, particularly in areas already affected by the initial earthquake.\n\n## Estimations of Losses\n\nThe estimated losses from the earthquakes were significant, with the Turkish government estimating damages of over $10 billion. The Syrian government estimated losses of over $5 billion.\n\n# Aftermath\n\n## Turkey\n\n### Search and Rescue\n\nSearch and rescue efforts were launched immediately after the earthquakes, with teams from Turkey and around the world working to locate and rescue survivors. The search and rescue efforts were challenged by the scale of the disaster and the difficulty of accessing affected areas.\n\n### Charity and Volunteer Campaigns\n\nCharity and volunteer campaigns were launched to support those affected by the earthquakes.

Locke, a 22-year-old Black man, was shot and killed by a Minneapolis police officer during the execution of a no-knock search warrant. The incident sparked widespread outrage and protests, leading to calls for police reform and accountability.\n\n# Background\n\n## Persons involved\n\nAmir Locke was a 22-year-old Black man who lived in Minneapolis. He was a licensed gun owner and worked as a part-time DoorDash driver. The Minneapolis police officer who shot Locke was Mark Hanneman, a 14-year veteran of the force. Hanneman was part of the SWAT team that executed the no-knock search warrant.\n\n## Search warrant\n\nThe no-knock search warrant was obtained by the Minneapolis police department as part of a homicide investigation. The warrant was related to a case involving Locke's cousin, who was a suspect in a murder that occurred in January 2022. Police had obtained a warrant to search Locke's apartment, as well as several other locations, in an effort to gather evidence.\n\n# Incident\n\nOn February 2, 2022, at approximately 6:48 a.m., the Minneapolis SWAT team executed the no-knock search warrant at Locke's apartment. Locke, who was not the target of the warrant, was asleep on the couch with a gun in his hand. When the police entered the apartment, Locke was startled and began to move. Officer Hanneman shot Locke three times, killing him. The entire incident was captured on body camera footage.\n\n# Investigations\n\nThe Minnesota Bureau of Investigation (MBI) launched an investigation into the shooting, which is standard protocol for police-involved shootings in the state. The MBI reviewed body camera footage, interviewed witnesses, and collected physical evidence. The investigation was later turned over to the Hennepin County Attorney's Office for review.\n\n# No-knock warrant moratorium and restrictions\n\nIn response to the killing of Amir Locke, the Minneapolis City Council passed a resolution calling for a moratorium on no-knock warrants. The resolution also called for increased transparency and accountability in the use of no-knock warrants. Additionally, the Minneapolis Police Department announced new restrictions on the use of no-knock warrants, including requiring a written justification for the use of such warrants.\n\n# Reaction\n\n## Family\n\nLocke's family was devastated by his death and expressed outrage at the police department's actions. Locke's mother, Karen Locke, stated that her son was \"executed\" by the police and called for justice. Locke's family also filed a civil lawsuit against the city of Minneapolis and the police department.\n\n## Officials\n\nMinneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Police Chief Medaria Arradondo expressed condolences to Locke's family and promised a thorough investigation. However, they also faced criticism for their handling of the incident. Some officials called for greater transparency and accountability in the police department's use of force.\n\n## Community groups\n\nCommunity groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the NAACP, condemned the killing of Amir Locke and called for police reform. These groups argued that the incident highlighted the need for greater accountability and transparency in the police department's use of force.\n\n# Protests\n\n## In Minneapolis—Saint Paul\n\nProtests erupted in Minneapolis and Saint Paul in the days following Locke's death. Demonstrators called for justice and police reform, and some clashed with police. The protests were largely peaceful, but there were reports of property damage and arrests.\n\n## Elsewhere\n\nProtests also took place in other cities across the United States, including New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago. These protests were part of a larger movement calling for police reform and accountability.\n\n# Civil lawsuit\n\nLocke's family filed a civil lawsuit against the city of Minneapolis and the police department, alleging that Locke's Fourth Amendment rights were violated. The lawsuit also alleged that the police department's use of force was excessive and that the department had a pattern of violating the rights of Black men.\n\n# See also\n\n* Police brutality in the United States\n* Black Lives Matter\n* Police reform in the United States\n\n# External links\n\n* Body camera footage of the incident (warning: graphic content)\n* Minneapolis Police Department's statement on the incident\n* Locke family's statement on the incident", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Killing_of_Amir_Locke\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Persons involved\n##Search warrant\n#Incident\n#Investigations\n#No-knock warrant moratorium and restrictions\n#Reaction\n##Family\n##Officials\n##Community groups\n#Protests\n##In Minneapolis—Saint Paul\n##Elsewhere\n#Civil lawsuit\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The work is a quintessential representation of the Pop Art movement, which celebrated the familiarity and ubiquity of consumer culture.\n\n#Early career\n\nAndy Warhol's early career as an artist was marked by his work as a commercial illustrator in New York City. Warhol moved to New York in 1949 and quickly established himself as a prominent figure in the city's art scene.\n\n##New York art scene\n\nWarhol's involvement in the New York art scene was instrumental in shaping his artistic style and interests. He was particularly drawn to the city's vibrant commercial art scene, where he worked as an illustrator for various magazines, including Vogue and Harper's Bazaar.\n\n##Pop art\n\nWarhol's work in the 1960s was heavily influenced by the emerging Pop Art movement. Pop Art was a reaction against the abstract expressionism that dominated the art world at the time, instead focusing on the everyday, the mundane, and the mass-produced. Warhol was fascinated by the ways in which consumer culture was shaping American society, and he saw the Campbell's Soup Can as an iconic representation of this phenomenon.\n\n#Premiere\n\nCampbell's Soup Cans premiered at the Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles in 1962. The exhibition was a groundbreaking event in the art world, with many critics and collectors responding with shock and confusion to Warhol's bold and unapologetic celebration of consumer culture.\n\n##Subsequent publicity\n\nThe exhibition generated a significant amount of publicity, with many newspapers and magazines publishing reviews and feature articles about Warhol's work. The attention surrounding the exhibition helped to establish Warhol as a major figure in the art world, and Campbell's Soup Cans quickly became an iconic representation of the Pop Art movement.\n\n#Campbell's Soup Company\n\nCampbell's Soup Company was founded in 1869 by Joseph A. Campbell and Abraham Anderson. The company quickly established itself as a leading manufacturer of canned soups and other food products.\n\n##Can and label history\n\nCampbell's Soup Company has a long history of innovative packaging design. The company's iconic red and white can design was introduced in the 1890s and has remained largely unchanged to this day. Warhol was particularly drawn to the simplicity and familiarity of the Campbell's Soup Can design, seeing it as an iconic representation of American consumer culture.\n\n##Relation to Warhol's art\n\nWarhol's use of the Campbell's Soup Can as a subject was not simply a matter of chance. The artist was deeply interested in the ways in which consumer culture was shaping American society, and he saw the Campbell's Soup Can as an iconic representation of this phenomenon. Warhol's use of the Campbell's Soup Can also reflects his fascination with the banal and the mundane, as well as his interest in exploring the relationship between high art and popular culture.\n\n#Inspiration\n\nWarhol's inspiration for Campbell's Soup Cans came from a variety of sources. The artist was particularly drawn to the work of comic strip artists and illustrators, as well as the advertising and packaging design that filled the streets and magazines of New York City.\n\n##Artist colleagues\n\nWarhol's work was also influenced by his relationships with other artists and musicians. The artist was a key figure in the New York City art scene, and he was friends with many of the leading figures of the time, including Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, and Edie Sedgwick.\n\n#Interpretation\n\nCampbell's Soup Cans has been interpreted in a variety of ways by art critics and historians. Some have seen the work as a commentary on the banality and superficiality of consumer culture, while others have interpreted it as a celebration of the familiar and the mundane.\n\n#Variations\n\nWarhol created numerous variations of Campbell's Soup Cans throughout his career. Some of these variations feature different flavors of soup, while others feature the same flavor in different colors or arrangements.\n\n##Campbell's Soup I and Campbell's Soup Cans II\n\nWarhol's first series of silkscreen prints, Campbell's Soup I, was created in 1962. The series featured 10 different flavors of soup, each in a different arrangement. The second series, Campbell's Soup Cans II, was created in 1963 and featured 200 different silkscreen prints, each with a different flavor of soup.\n\n##Colored soup cans\n\nIn the late 1960s, Warhol began creating colored versions of the Campbell's Soup Can. These works feature the same iconic design as the original black and white prints, but with a range of bright, bold colors.\n\n##Unauthorized versions\n\nWarhol's Campbell's Soup Cans have been widely imitated and parodied over the years. Many artists and designers have created their own versions of the work, often without permission from Warhol or his estate.\n\n##Other variations\n\nWarhol also created numerous other variations of Campbell's Soup Cans, including sculptures, prints, and even a series of Campbell's Soup Can-shaped cookie jars.\n\n#Conclusion\n\nCampbell's Soup Cans is a iconic series of silkscreen prints that has become synonymous with the Pop Art movement. Warhol's use of the Campbell's Soup Can as a subject was a bold and unapologetic celebration of consumer culture, and the work continues to be widely admired and imitated today.\n\n#See also\n\n* Pop Art\n* Andy Warhol\n* Campbell's Soup Company\n* Silkscreen printing\n\n#Notes\n\n* This article is a general overview of Campbell's Soup Cans and does not provide an exhaustive history of the work.\n* The article does not include citations or references, but is based on widely available information about Warhol and his work.\n\n#References\n\n* None\n\n#External links\n\n* The Andy Warhol Museum\n* Campbell's Soup Company\n* The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Campbell's_Soup_Cans\" following this outline:\n\n#Early career\n##New York art scene\n##Pop art\n#Premiere\n##Subsequent publicity\n#Campbell's Soup Company\n##Can and label history\n##Relation to Warhol's art\n#Inspiration\n##Artist colleagues\n#Interpretation\n#Variations\n##Campbell's Soup I and Campbell's Soup Cans II\n##Colored soup cans\n##Unauthorized versions\n##Other variations\n#Conclusion\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The mission serves as a critical step in testing the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, the Orion spacecraft, and the ground systems necessary for future crewed missions to the Moon.\n\nMission Profile\n--------------\n\nThe Artemis I mission profile is designed to simulate the trajectory and conditions that a crewed mission to the Moon would encounter. The mission will send the Orion spacecraft on a lunar flyby, followed by a return to Earth, demonstrating the spacecraft's ability to withstand the harsh conditions of space travel and re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere.\n\n### Mission Profile Animation\n\nNASA has released an animated video illustrating the Artemis I mission profile, showcasing the spacecraft's journey from launch to splashdown. The animation provides a detailed visualization of the mission's critical phases, including launch, trans-lunar injection, lunar flyby, and re-entry.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nThe Artemis I mission is the culmination of years of development and testing of the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and the Orion spacecraft.\n\n### Ground Testing\n\nGround testing of the SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft began in 2014 and continued through 2020. The testing campaign included a series of critical tests, such as the SLS rocket's core stage hot fire test and the Orion spacecraft's Ascent Abort-2 test.\n\n### Assembly\n\nThe final assembly of the SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft took place at the Kennedy Space Center's Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB). The rocket's core stage was integrated with the solid rocket boosters, while the Orion spacecraft was mated to the rocket's Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage (ICPS).\n\n### Launch Preparations\n\nLaunch preparations for Artemis I began in 2021, with the rocket and spacecraft undergoing final checks and preparations at the Kennedy Space Center's Launch Complex 39B.\n\n### Initial Launch Attempts\n\nThe initial launch attempt for Artemis I was scheduled for August 29, 2022, but was scrubbed due to technical issues. A second launch attempt was made on September 3, 2022, but was also scrubbed due to a fuel leak. The rocket and spacecraft were rolled back to the VAB for repairs and further testing.\n\nFlight\n------\n\nThe Artemis I mission launched on November 16, 2022, at 1:47 AM EST, from the Kennedy Space Center's Launch Complex 39B.\n\n### Launch\n\nThe SLS rocket lifted off from the launch pad, carrying the Orion spacecraft on a 26-day journey to the Moon and back. The rocket's solid rocket boosters separated from the core stage after two minutes, followed by the jettisoning of the launch abort system.\n\n### Outbound Flight\n\nThe Orion spacecraft entered into a lunar flyby trajectory, traveling more than 280,000 miles from Earth. The spacecraft performed a series of course corrections and engine burns to ensure a precise lunar flyby.\n\n### Lunar Orbit\n\nThe Orion spacecraft flew within 4,000 miles of the lunar surface, testing the spacecraft's navigation and communication systems. The spacecraft captured stunning images of the lunar surface, including the Moon's south pole and the Apollo 11 landing site.\n\n### Return Flight\n\nThe Orion spacecraft began its return journey to Earth, using the Moon's gravity to slingshot the spacecraft back towards the planet. The spacecraft performed a series of engine burns to slow its velocity and prepare for re-entry.\n\n### Reentry and Splashdown\n\nThe Orion spacecraft re-entered the Earth's atmosphere, reaching temperatures of up to 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit. The spacecraft deployed its drogue parachute and main parachutes, slowing its descent to a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nPayloads\n--------\n\nThe Artemis I mission carried a total of 13 payloads, including cubesats and experiments.\n\n### Cubesats\n\nTen cubesats were launched on the Artemis I mission, including the Near-Earth Asteroid Scout, the Lunar Trailblazer, and the BioSentinel. These small satellites will conduct a range of scientific experiments, including asteroid detection and lunar resource utilization.\n\nMedia Outreach\n--------------\n\nNASA conducted an extensive media outreach campaign for the Artemis I mission, including press conferences, social media events, and live coverage of the launch.\n\nSee Also\n--------\n\n* Artemis program\n* Space Launch System\n* Orion spacecraft\n* Lunar Gateway\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nThe Artemis I mission marked a critical step in NASA's plans to return humans to the lunar surface by 2025.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nExternal Links\n---------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Artemis_I\" following this outline:\n\n#Mission profile\n##Mission profile animation\n#Background\n##Ground testing\n##Assembly\n##Launch preparations\n##Initial launch attempts\n#Flight\n##Launch\n##Outbound flight\n##Lunar orbit\n##Return flight\n##Reentry and splashdown\n#Payloads\n##Cubesats\n#Media outreach\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The election was called following the dissolution of the 46th Parliament, and resulted in a change of government with the Australian Labor Party (ALP) led by Anthony Albanese winning a majority of seats in the House of Representatives.\n\n#Background\n\n##Previous election\n\nThe previous federal election was held on 18 May 2019, which resulted in the Liberal Party of Australia led by Scott Morrison winning a third consecutive term in government. The election saw a significant swing against the ALP, with the party failing to win a majority of seats in the House of Representatives.\n\n##Composition of parliament\n\nPrior to the 2022 election, the 46th Parliament consisted of 151 members in the House of Representatives and 76 senators in the Senate. The Liberal Party held 75 seats in the House of Representatives, with the ALP holding 69 seats. The remaining seven seats were held by independents and minor parties. In the Senate, the Liberal Party held 31 seats, with the ALP holding 26 seats.\n\n##Events of the 46th Parliament\n\nThe 46th Parliament was marked by several significant events, including the COVID-19 pandemic, which had a major impact on the country's economy and healthcare system. The government's response to the pandemic was a major issue during the parliament, with the ALP criticizing the government's handling of the crisis. Other significant events during the parliament included the 2019-2020 bushfire season, which had a major impact on the country's environment and wildlife.\n\n##Change in party registration rules\n\nIn 2021, the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) introduced new rules for party registration, which required parties to have a minimum of 1,500 members to be eligible for registration. The change was intended to reduce the number of minor parties contesting federal elections.\n\n##Party preselection issues\n\nIn the lead-up to the election, several parties experienced issues with preselection, including the Liberal Party and the ALP. Several sitting members of parliament were challenged for preselection, with some losing their endorsement.\n\n##Independents\n\nSeveral independents contested the election, including some high-profile candidates. The independents were seen as a major threat to the major parties, particularly in marginal seats.\n\n#Electoral system\n\nAustralia uses a compulsory preferential voting system for federal elections. In the House of Representatives, voters are required to rank candidates in order of preference, with the candidate with the lowest number of first-preference votes being eliminated and their preferences being redistributed to other candidates. In the Senate, voters can choose to vote above the line or below the line, with above-the-line votes being allocated to parties according to their preference tickets.\n\n#State of electorates\n\n##Redistribution\n\nPrior to the election, a redistribution of electoral boundaries was conducted, which resulted in changes to several electorates. The redistribution was intended to reflect changes in population and demographic trends.\n\n##Election pendulum (House of Representatives)\n\nThe election pendulum is a measure of the number of seats that would need to change hands for a party to win a majority of seats in the House of Representatives. Prior to the election, the pendulum suggested that the ALP needed to win a net gain of seven seats to win a majority.\n\n#Voter registration\n\nVoter registration is compulsory in Australia, with all eligible citizens required to be enrolled to vote. The AEC reported that over 17 million Australians were enrolled to vote in the 2022 election.\n\n#Election date\n\n##Dissolution of parliament\n\nThe 46th Parliament was dissolved on 11 April 2022, with the Governor-General, David Hurley, issuing a proclamation calling the election.\n\n#Election timeline\n\n* 11 April 2022: The 46th Parliament is dissolved, and the election is called.\n* 18 April 2022: Nominations for candidates close.\n* 21 May 2022: The election is held.\n\n#Campaign events\n\n##Leaders' debates\n\nSeveral leaders' debates were held during the campaign, including a debate between Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese.\n\n##Campaign\n\nThe campaign was marked by several significant events, including the release of the parties' election policies and the announcement of major campaign promises.\n\n##Preferences\n\nThe allocation of preferences was a major issue during the campaign, with several parties announcing that they would direct preferences to other parties.\n\n#Candidates\n\n##Parties\n\nSeveral parties contested the election, including the Liberal Party, the ALP, the Greens, and several minor parties.\n\n#Retiring members\n\n##Labor\n\nSeveral Labor members of parliament announced their retirement prior to the election, including Wayne Swan and Anthony Byrne.\n\n##Liberal\n\nSeveral Liberal members of parliament announced their retirement prior to the election, including Julie Bishop and Christopher Pyne.\n\n##Nationals\n\nSeveral Nationals members of parliament announced their retirement prior to the election, including Nigel Scullion.\n\n#Opinion polling\n\nOpinion polling during the campaign suggested that the ALP was ahead of the Liberal Party, with the party's primary vote increasing significantly.\n\n#Newspaper endorsements\n\n##Weekend editions\n\nSeveral weekend editions of newspapers endorsed the ALP, including the Sydney Morning Herald and The Age.\n\n##Metropolitan daily newspapers\n\nSeveral metropolitan daily newspapers endorsed the Liberal Party, including The Australian and the Daily Telegraph.\n\n##Online publications\n\nSeveral online publications endorsed the ALP, including Crikey and The Conversation.\n\n##Regional newspapers\n\nSeveral regional newspapers endorsed the Nationals, including the Queensland Country Life and the Western Magazine.\n\n#Results\n\n##House of Representatives\n\nThe ALP won a majority of seats in the House of Representatives, with the party winning 78 seats to the Liberal Party's 58.\n\n##Senate\n\nThe ALP won 26 seats in the Senate, with the Liberal Party winning 25 seats.\n\n#Seats changing hands\n\nSeveral seats changed hands during the election, including several marginal seats.\n\n#Maps\n\nA number of electoral maps were produced during the campaign, including maps showing the distribution of seats and the margin of victory in each electorate.\n\n#Aftermath and reactions\n\n##Domestic reactions\n\nThe election result was met with a range of reactions from domestic commentators, with some praising the ALP's victory and others criticizing the Liberal Party's performance.\n\n##International reactions\n\nThe election result was met with interest from international commentators, with several countries congratulating the ALP on its victory.\n\n#See also\n\n* 2022 Australian federal election (Senate)\n* 2022 Australian federal election (House of Representatives)\n* Australian federal election, 2019\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is a general overview of the 2022 Australian federal election.

These clocks are the most accurate type of timekeeping device, with an error of only one second over tens of millions of years. Atomic clocks are used as reference points for modern civil time and have numerous applications in science, technology, and industry.\n\n**History**\n\nThe development of atomic clocks began in the 1940s, with the first working model being constructed in 1950 by physicist Isidor Rabi and his colleagues at Columbia University. However, it was not until the 1960s that atomic clocks became widely used as timekeeping devices.\n\n### Definition of the second\n\nThe second is the fundamental unit of time in the International System of Units (SI). In 1967, the 13th General Conference on Weights and Measures defined the second as the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium-133 atom. This definition was chosen because it was based on a physical phenomenon that could be reproduced with high accuracy.\n\n### Metrology advancements and optical clocks\n\nThe development of optical clocks in the 1990s and 2000s revolutionized the field of metrology. Optical clocks use the vibrations of atoms or ions to measure time, which allows for even higher accuracy than traditional atomic clocks. These advancements have enabled scientists to study phenomena such as gravitational redshift and the variation of fundamental constants.\n\n### Chip-scale atomic clocks\n\nIn recent years, researchers have developed chip-scale atomic clocks, which are small enough to be integrated into portable devices. These clocks have numerous potential applications, including navigation systems, telecommunications, and basic scientific research.\n\n**Measuring time with atomic clocks**\n\nAtomic clocks use the vibrations of atoms to measure time. The basic mechanism consists of a sample of atoms, a radiation source, and a detector.\n\n### Clock mechanism\n\nThe clock mechanism works as follows: the sample of atoms is excited by the radiation source, which causes the atoms to vibrate at a specific frequency. The detector measures the frequency of these vibrations, which is used to generate a clock signal. The clock signal is then divided down to produce a time signal.\n\n### Tuning and optimization\n\nTo achieve high accuracy, atomic clocks must be carefully tuned and optimized. This involves adjusting the radiation source, the sample of atoms, and the detector to achieve the highest possible frequency stability.\n\n**Accuracy**\n\nAtomic clocks are the most accurate type of timekeeping device, with an error of only one second over tens of millions of years. This accuracy is due to the fact that the vibrations of atoms are highly stable and can be measured with high precision.\n\n**Comparing atomic clocks**\n\nAtomic clocks are compared to each other to ensure that they are keeping accurate time. This is done by measuring the difference between the clock signals of two or more clocks.\n\n### Time standards\n\nThe international time standard is Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), which is based on the average of over 200 atomic clocks located around the world. These clocks are compared to each other on a regular basis to ensure that they are keeping accurate time.\n\n### Synchronization with satellites\n\nAtomic clocks are also used to synchronize the clocks on satellites with the international time standard. This is done by comparing the clock signals of the satellite clocks with the signals from ground-based atomic clocks.\n\n### International timekeeping\n\nInternational timekeeping is coordinated by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS). The IERS is responsible for maintaining the international time standard and ensuring that it is consistent with the Earth's rotation.\n\n### Fiber Optics\n\nFiber optics are used to compare atomic clocks over long distances. This is done by sending a laser signal through a fiber optic cable and measuring the time difference between the signal and the clock signal.\n\n**Microwave atomic clocks**\n\nMicrowave atomic clocks use the vibrations of atoms to measure time in the microwave frequency range.\n\n### Caesium\n\nCaesium atomic clocks are the most common type of microwave atomic clock. They use the vibrations of caesium-133 atoms to measure time.\n\n#### Block diagram\n\nA block diagram of a caesium atomic clock is shown below:\n```\n+---------------+\n|  Radiation  |\n|  Source     |\n+---------------+\n       |\n       |\n       v\n+---------------+\n|  Sample of  |\n|  Caesium-133 |\n|  Atoms      |\n+---------------+\n       |\n       |\n       v\n+---------------+\n|  Detector    |\n+---------------+\n       |\n       |\n       v\n+---------------+\n|  Clock Signal|\n+---------------+\n```\n### Rubidium\n\nRubidium atomic clocks are another type of microwave atomic clock. They use the vibrations of rubidium-87 atoms to measure time.\n\n### Hydrogen\n\nHydrogen atomic clocks use the vibrations of hydrogen-1 atoms to measure time.\n\n**Other types of atomic clocks**\n\nThere are several other types of atomic clocks, including quantum clocks and nuclear clocks.\n\n### Quantum clocks\n\nQuantum clocks use the principles of quantum mechanics to measure time. They are still in the early stages of development but have the potential to be even more accurate than traditional atomic clocks.\n\n### Nuclear clock concept\n\nThe nuclear clock concept uses the vibrations of the nucleus to measure time. This concept is still in the early stages of development but has the potential to be even more accurate than traditional atomic clocks.\n\n**Potential for redefining the second**\n\nThe development of new types of atomic clocks has raised the possibility of redefining the second.\n\n### Rydberg constant\n\nThe Rydberg constant is a fundamental constant that is used to define the second. However, recent measurements have shown that the Rydberg constant may not be as constant as previously thought.\n\n### Requirements\n\nAny new definition of the second would need to meet certain requirements, including high accuracy and stability.\n\n### Secondary representations of the second\n\nSecondary representations of the second are used to realize the international time standard. These representations are based on the average of multiple atomic clocks.\n\n**Applications**\n\nAtomic clocks have numerous applications in science, technology, and industry.\n\n### Global navigation satellite systems\n\nAtomic clocks are used in global navigation satellite systems such as GPS and GLONASS.\n\n#### Experimental space clock\n\nThe experimental space clock is a clock that is being developed for use on satellites. It will use a combination of atomic clocks and optical clocks to achieve high accuracy.\n\n#### Military usage\n\nAtomic clocks are used by the military for navigation and communication.\n\n### Time signal radio transmitters\n\nTime signal radio transmitters use atomic clocks to broadcast a time signal.\n\n### General relativity\n\nAtomic clocks are used to test the predictions of general relativity.\n\n### Financial systems\n\nAtomic clocks are used in financial systems to timestamp transactions.\n\n### Transportable Optical Clocks\n\nTransportable optical clocks are clocks that can be transported and used in different locations. They have numerous potential applications, including navigation systems and basic scientific research.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Time\n* Frequency\n* Metrology\n* International System of Units\n\n**Explanatory notes**\n\nThis article uses the following notation:\n* UTC: Coordinated Universal Time\n* IERS: International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service\n* SI: International System of Units", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Atomic_clock\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Definition of the second\n##Metrology advancements and optical clocks\n##Chip-scale atomic clocks\n#Measuring time with atomic clocks\n##Clock mechanism\n##Tuning and optimization\n#Accuracy\n#Comparing atomic clocks\n##Time standards\n##Synchronization with satellites\n##International timekeeping\n##Fiber Optics\n#Microwave atomic clocks\n##Caesium\n###Block diagram\n##Rubidium\n##Hydrogen\n#Other types of atomic clocks\n##Quantum clocks\n##Nuclear clock concept\n#Potential for redefining the second\n##Rydberg constant\n##Requirements\n##Secondary representations of the second\n#Applications\n##Global navigation satellite systems\n###Experimental space clock\n###Military usage\n##Time signal radio transmitters\n##General relativity\n##Financial systems\n##Transportable Optical Clocks\n#See also\n#Explanatory notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

She is the first person from the tribal community to hold the office and the second woman to become the President of India. Prior to her presidency, she served as the Governor of Jharkhand from 2015 to 2021.\n\n#Personal life\n\nDroupadi Murmu was born on 20 June 1958 in Uparbeda village, Mayurbhanj district, Odisha, India. She was born into a Santhal tribal family. Her father's name was Biranchi Narayan Tudu and her mother's name was Neelima Tudu. Murmu's early life was marked by poverty and struggle. She lost her parents at a young age and was raised by her brother. Despite the difficulties, she pursued her education and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from Ramadevi Women's College, Bhubaneswar.\n\nMurmu married Shyam Charan Murmu and had two sons, Laxman and Sipun. Her family was affected by tragedy when her husband, sons, mother, and brother died in a span of four years. Despite the personal losses, Murmu continued to work and pursue her career.\n\n#Early career\n\nBefore entering politics, Murmu worked as a junior assistant in the irrigation department of the Government of Odisha from 1979 to 1983. She then worked as a teacher at Sri Aurobindo Integral Education Centre, Rairangpur from 1983 to 1994.\n\n#Political career\n\nMurmu's entry into politics was facilitated by her involvement with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). She joined the party in 1997 and quickly rose through the ranks. She was elected as a councillor in the Rairangpur Nagar Panchayat in 1997 and later became the vice-president of the panchayat in 2000.\n\nIn 2000, Murmu was elected to the Odisha Legislative Assembly from the Rairangpur constituency on a BJP ticket. She served as a Minister of State for Transport and Commerce from 2000 to 2002 and later as a Minister of State for Fisheries and Animal Resources Development from 2002 to 2004.\n\n#Governor of Jharkhand (2015–2021)\n\nIn 2015, Murmu was appointed as the Governor of Jharkhand, becoming the first woman from Odisha to hold the position. During her tenure, she played a crucial role in maintaining law and order in the state.\n\n##Pathalgadi movement\n\nDuring her governorship, Jharkhand witnessed the Pathalgadi movement, a tribal uprising that demanded greater autonomy for tribal communities. Murmu played a key role in negotiating with the protesters and addressing their concerns. She also ensured that the state government took steps to implement the Fifth Schedule of the Constitution, which provides for the protection of tribal rights.\n\n##Religion and land bill\n\nIn 2016, the Jharkhand government passed the Jharkhand Religious Freedom Bill and the Jharkhand Land Acquisition Bill. Murmu gave her assent to the bills, which were aimed at regulating religious conversions and land acquisition in the state. The bills were criticized by opposition parties and tribal groups, who argued that they would harm the interests of tribal communities.\n\n#Presidential campaign\n\nIn 2022, Murmu was chosen as the National Democratic Alliance's (NDA) candidate for the presidential election. Her candidature was supported by the BJP and its allies. Murmu's campaign focused on her humble background, her commitment to tribal welfare, and her experience as a governor.\n\nMurmu's nomination was seen as a strategic move by the BJP to consolidate its support among tribal communities. The party also hoped to benefit from the perception that Murmu was a consensus candidate who could win the support of opposition parties.\n\n#Presidency (2022–present)\n\nMurmu was elected as the President of India on 21 July 2022, defeating opposition candidate Yashwant Sinha. She took office on 25 July 2022, becoming the 15th President of India.\n\nAs President, Murmu has emphasized the need to protect the rights of tribal communities and to promote their welfare. She has also called for greater inclusivity and diversity in Indian society.\n\n#Electoral performance\n\n| Election | Constituency | Party | Result | Votes | Percentage |\n| 2000 Odisha Legislative Assembly election | Rairangpur | Bharatiya Janata Party | Won | 36,869 | 43.17% |\n| 2004 Odisha Legislative Assembly election | Rairangpur | Bharatiya Janata Party | Lost | 25,395 | 30.54% |\n| 2009 Odisha Legislative Assembly election | Rairangpur | Bharatiya Janata Party | Lost | 20,778 | 23.53% |\n| 2022 Presidential election | India | National Democratic Alliance | Won | 6,76,803 | 64.03% |\n\n#State honours\n\nMurmu has received several state honours for her contributions to public service.

Discovery\n=====================\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery is a multinational mass media and entertainment conglomerate formed through the spin-off of WarnerMedia by AT&T and its merger with Discovery, Inc. The company is one of the largest media conglomerates in the world, with a diverse portfolio of brands and assets in the film, television, and streaming industries.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\n### 1923–1979\n\nWarner Bros. was founded in 1923 by four brothers: Harry, Albert, Samuel, and Jack Warner. The company started as a film production and distribution business, releasing its first feature film, \"My Four Years in Germany,\" in 1918. Over the years, Warner Bros. grew to become one of the major Hollywood studios, producing iconic films such as \"The Jazz Singer\" (1927), \"Casablanca\" (1942), and \"Rebel Without a Cause\" (1955).\n\nMeanwhile, Discovery, Inc. was founded in 1985 by John Hendricks as the Cable Educational Network. The company launched the Discovery Channel in 1985, which quickly gained popularity for its documentary-style programming. Over the years, Discovery expanded its portfolio of channels to include TLC, Animal Planet, and the Food Network, among others.\n\n### 1979–1994\n\nIn 1979, Warner Bros. was acquired by Warner Communications, a conglomerate formed by Steven Ross. Warner Communications merged with Time Inc. in 1990 to form Time Warner, one of the largest media conglomerates in the world. Time Warner expanded Warner Bros. into the television industry, producing popular shows such as \"Friends\" and \"ER.\"\n\n### 1996–2019\n\nIn 1996, Time Warner acquired Turner Broadcasting System, which included the TBS and TNT networks. The company expanded its portfolio of channels to include CNN, HBO, and the Warner Bros. film studio. In 2001, AOL merged with Time Warner, but the deal failed to produce expected synergies, and the companies split in 2009.\n\nIn 2018, AT&T acquired Time Warner for $85.4 billion, renaming it WarnerMedia. WarnerMedia continued to operate as a subsidiary of AT&T, producing content for HBO, Warner Bros., and Turner Broadcasting System.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### Formation and beginning of operations (2021–2022)\n\nIn May 2021, AT&T announced that it would spin off WarnerMedia and merge it with Discovery, Inc. to form a new company, Warner Bros. Discovery. The deal was completed on April 8, 2022, and Warner Bros. Discovery began trading on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker symbol WBD.\n\nThe new company is led by David Zaslav, the former CEO of Discovery, Inc. Zaslav has stated that the company will focus on producing high-quality content for its streaming services, including HBO Max and Discovery+. Warner Bros. Discovery has also announced plans to expand its portfolio of brands, including the acquisition of the rights to the \"Harry Potter\" franchise.\n\n### Turnover and cutbacks (2023–present)\n\nIn 2023, Warner Bros. Discovery began implementing cost-cutting measures to reduce its debt and improve profitability. The company announced plans to lay off hundreds of employees, including executives and production staff. Warner Bros. Discovery also cancelled several projects, including the \"Batgirl\" film and the \"Scooby-Doo\" reboot.\n\nDespite the challenges, Warner Bros. Discovery remains one of the largest media conglomerates in the world, with a diverse portfolio of brands and assets. The company continues to produce popular content for its streaming services and has announced plans to expand its portfolio of brands in the coming years.\n\nAssets\n------\n\nWarner Bros.

Nicknamed \"The Killer,\" he is one of the pioneers of rock and roll music. Lewis's music career spans over seven decades, during which he has released numerous hit songs and albums, and has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame.\n\nEarly Life\n-----------\n\nJerry Lee Lewis was born in Ferriday, Louisiana, to Elmo Lewis and Mamie (née Stafford) Lewis. He grew up in a poor household with his parents and his cousins, Mickey Gilley and Jimmy Swaggart. Lewis's parents mortgaged their farm to buy him a piano when he was nine years old. He began playing the piano at a young age and was influenced by gospel music, boogie-woogie, and rhythm and blues.\n\nLewis's family moved to Memphis, Tennessee, when he was a teenager. He attended the Memphis School of Music and later performed on the Louisiana Hayride, a popular radio show that launched the careers of several famous musicians, including Hank Williams and Elvis Presley.\n\nCareer\n-------\n\n### J&M Studio\n\nIn 1952, Lewis recorded his first single, \"Crazy Arms,\" at J&M Studio in New Orleans. However, the single was not successful, and Lewis continued to work as a session musician and performer in various bands.\n\n### Sun Records\n\nIn 1956, Lewis signed with Sun Records, a Memphis-based record label founded by Sam Phillips. Lewis's first single for Sun Records, \"Crazy Arms,\" was released in 1956, but it was not a commercial success.

The marriage was a scandal, and Lewis's popularity began to decline. He was blacklisted by many radio stations and was unable to perform on many television shows.\n\n### Smash Records\n\nIn 1963, Lewis signed with Smash Records, a subsidiary of Mercury Records. Lewis's first single for Smash Records, \"I'm on Fire,\" was released in 1964, but it was not a commercial success. However, his next single, \"What's Made Milwaukee Famous (Has Made a Loser Out of Me),\" released in 1968, became a hit and reached the top of the country charts.\n\n### Live at the Star Club, Hamburg\n\nIn 1964, Lewis recorded a live album, \"Live at the Star Club, Hamburg,\" which was released in 1965. The album was recorded at the Star Club in Hamburg, Germany, and features Lewis's energetic live performances.\n\n### Country Comeback\n\nIn the late 1960s, Lewis began to focus on country music, and his career experienced a resurgence. He released several successful country albums, including \"Another Place, Another Time\" and \"She Still Comes Around,\" and had several hit country singles, including \"What's Made Milwaukee Famous (Has Made a Loser Out of Me)\" and \"She Still Comes Around.\"\n\n### Grand Ole Opry Appearance\n\nIn 1972, Lewis appeared on the Grand Ole Opry, a weekly country music show in Nashville, Tennessee. Lewis's appearance on the show was a significant moment in his career, and he became a regular performer on the Opry.\n\n### The Session and Southern Roots\n\nIn 1973, Lewis released the album \"The Session,\" which features Lewis's performances with several other famous musicians, including Carl Perkins and Johnny Cash. Lewis also released the album \"Southern Roots,\" which features his performances of several classic country songs.\n\n### Later Career\n\nIn the 1980s, Lewis continued to perform and record music. He released several successful albums, including \"Young Blood\" and \"Pumpin' Piano Cat,\" and had several hit singles, including \"I'd Do It All Again\" and \"Thirty-Nine and Holding.\"\n\nLewis has continued to perform and record music throughout his career, and has released several successful albums in recent years, including \"Young Blood\" and \"Rock & Roll Time.\"\n\nMusic Legacy\n-------------\n\n### Accolades\n\nLewis has been inducted into several music halls of fame, including the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the Country Music Hall of Fame, and the Grammy Hall of Fame.

After the war, he worked as a spy for the United States government, providing intelligence on Soviet activities in Europe. Von Bolschwing's life is a complex and intriguing mix of espionage, politics, and business, spanning multiple continents and regimes.\n\nEarly life and Nazi career\n-------------------------\n\n### Early life and business ventures\n\nOtto von Bolschwing was born on October 15, 1909, in Schönfließ, Pomerania, Germany (now Trzcińsko-Zdrój, Poland). He came from an aristocratic family and was raised in a traditional Prussian environment. Von Bolschwing's early life was marked by a strong sense of nationalism and anti-communism, which would shape his future career.\n\nIn the late 1920s, von Bolschwing began his business career in Berlin, working for various companies, including the German industrial conglomerate, Siemens. During this time, he became increasingly involved in right-wing politics and eventually joined the Nazi Party in 1930.\n\n### Mandatory Palestine\n\nIn 1933, von Bolschwing moved to Mandatory Palestine, where he worked as a business consultant and advisor to the German Consulate in Jerusalem. During his time in Palestine, he developed close relationships with Zionist leaders and became involved in the development of the Jewish settlement movement.\n\n### Office of Jewish Affairs\n\nIn 1935, von Bolschwing returned to Germany and joined the Office of Jewish Affairs, a department within the SS responsible for implementing the Nazi regime's anti-Jewish policies. He quickly rose through the ranks and became a key advisor to Adolf Eichmann, the notorious architect of the Holocaust.\n\nWorld War II\n------------\n\n### Romania\n\nIn 1940, von Bolschwing was assigned to the German Legation in Bucharest, Romania, where he worked as a liaison officer between the German government and the Romanian authorities. He played a significant role in promoting German interests in the region and was involved in the suppression of anti-German resistance movements.\n\n### Downfall and imprisonment\n\nAs the war turned against Germany, von Bolschwing's fortunes began to decline. In 1944, he was arrested by the Romanian authorities and imprisoned for his involvement in anti-Romanian activities. He remained in prison until the end of the war, when he was released by American forces.\n\n### Austria\n\nAfter his release, von Bolschwing moved to Austria, where he worked as a businessman and intelligence agent for the United States government. He provided information on Soviet activities in Eastern Europe and became a key figure in the post-war intelligence community.\n\nPostwar espionage\n----------------\n\n### Gehlen Organization\n\nIn 1947, von Bolschwing joined the Gehlen Organization, a German intelligence agency established by the United States to gather information on Soviet activities in Europe. He worked closely with Reinhard Gehlen, the agency's founder, and provided intelligence on Soviet military and economic activities.\n\n### Central Intelligence Agency\n\nIn 1954, von Bolschwing was recruited by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and became a key figure in the agency's operations in Europe. He provided intelligence on Soviet activities and was involved in various covert operations, including the training of anti-Soviet guerrilla fighters.\n\n### Cover-up\n\nDespite his involvement in Nazi atrocities, von Bolschwing's past was largely ignored by his American handlers. The CIA and other government agencies went to great lengths to cover up his involvement in the Nazi regime, and he was able to maintain a low profile throughout his post-war career.\n\n### Emigration to the United States\n\nIn the late 1950s, von Bolschwing emigrated to the United States, where he settled in California and began a new life as a businessman and intelligence consultant. He maintained his connections with the CIA and continued to provide intelligence on Soviet activities.\n\nLife in the United States\n-------------------------\n\n### Business career\n\nVon Bolschwing's business career in the United States was marked by success and controversy. He became involved in various business ventures, including real estate development and investment banking. However, he was also accused of involvement in various scandals, including the TCI scandal, which involved allegations of insider trading and corporate espionage.\n\n### TCI scandal\n\nIn the 1970s, von Bolschwing became embroiled in the TCI scandal, which involved allegations of insider trading and corporate espionage. The scandal centered on the activities of a group of businessmen who had used insider information to manipulate the stock market and amass large profits. Von Bolschwing was accused of being one of the key figures involved in the scandal, although he was never charged or convicted.\n\n### Later life and investigations\n\nIn the 1980s, von Bolschwing's past began to catch up with him. He was investigated by the Office of Special Investigations (OSI), a unit within the United States Department of Justice responsible for investigating Nazi war crimes. The OSI investigation led to a Congressional hearing, at which von Bolschwing was called to testify about his involvement in Nazi atrocities.\n\nVon Bolschwing died on March 7, 1982, at the age of 72, before the Congressional hearing could take place. His legacy remains complex and contested, with some viewing him as a ruthless Nazi operative and others seeing him as a brilliant intelligence agent who served the United States with distinction.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements.)\n\nExternal links\n---------------\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements.)\n\nBibliography\n------------\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements.)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Otto_von_Bolschwing\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and Nazi career\n##Early life and business ventures\n##Mandatory Palestine\n##Office of Jewish Affairs\n#World War II\n##Romania\n##Downfall and imprisonment\n##Austria\n#Postwar espionage\n##Gehlen Organization\n##Central Intelligence Agency\n##Cover-up\n##Emigration to the United States\n#Life in the United States\n##Business career\n##TCI scandal\n##Later life and investigations\n#References\n#External links\n#Bibliography\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He served in the Australian Defence Force (ADF) for over 20 years, including six deployments to Afghanistan, before being medically discharged in 2013. After leaving the military, Roberts-Smith pursued a career in business and later became a media commentator and author.\n\nEarly Life and Family\n--------------------\n\nBen Roberts-Smith was born on November 1, 1978, in Perth, Western Australia. His father, Len Roberts-Smith, was a prominent Western Australian businessman, and his mother, Sue, was a nurse. Roberts-Smith grew up in a middle-class family with two siblings. He attended Hale School, a private boys' school in Perth, where he developed an interest in sports, particularly rugby and cricket.\n\nMilitary Career\n--------------\n\nRoberts-Smith enlisted in the Australian Army in 1996, aged 18, and underwent basic training at the Australian Army Recruit Training Centre in Kapooka, New South Wales. He then attended the Royal Military College, Duntroon, graduating in 1998 as a lieutenant. Roberts-Smith served in various roles, including platoon commander and company second-in-command, in the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3 RAR).\n\nRoberts-Smith deployed to East Timor in 1999 as part of the International Force East Timor (INTERFET) and later to Afghanistan in 2006, 2007, 2009, 2010, and 2012. During his deployments, he served as a patrol commander, company commander, and operations officer. Roberts-Smith's military career was marked by numerous awards and commendations, including the Medal for Gallantry (MG) and the Distinguished Service Cross (DSC).\n\n### Military Decorations\n\n* Victoria Cross for Australia (V.C.) (2011)\n* Medal for Gallantry (MG) (2006)\n* Distinguished Service Cross (DSC) (2009)\n* Australian Active Service Medal (AASM)\n* Australian Service Medal (ASM)\n* United Nations Medal for East Timor (UNMIT)\n\nCorporate Career\n----------------\n\nAfter leaving the military in 2013, Roberts-Smith pursued a career in business. He worked as the general manager of Seven West Media's (SWM) Queensland operations and later became the chief operating officer of the company's television network. Roberts-Smith also served as a director on the board of the Australian War Memorial.\n\nOther Activities\n----------------\n\nRoberts-Smith has been involved in various charitable and community organizations, including the Australian Institute of Management (AIM) and the Australian Defence Force Assistance Trust. He has also worked as a media commentator and author, publishing his memoir, \"Warrior Brothers: My Life in the Australian SAS,\" in 2018.\n\nWar Crime Allegations\n----------------------\n\nIn 2018, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) and Fairfax Media published reports alleging that Roberts-Smith was involved in the murder of unarmed Afghan civilians during his deployments to Afghanistan. The reports claimed that Roberts-Smith and other Australian soldiers had engaged in a pattern of behavior that included the killing of prisoners and civilians.\n\n### Investigation\n\nThe Australian Federal Police (AFP) launched an investigation into the allegations in 2018. The investigation, codenamed Operation Solander, focused on the activities of Australian soldiers in Afghanistan between 2005 and 2013. The AFP has not commented publicly on the status of the investigation.\n\nDefamation Suit\n----------------\n\nIn 2018, Roberts-Smith commenced defamation proceedings against the ABC and Fairfax Media (now part of Nine Entertainment Co.) in the Federal Court of Australia. Roberts-Smith claimed that the reports published by the ABC and Fairfax Media were defamatory and damaged his reputation.\n\n### Judgment\n\nIn June 2020, the Federal Court delivered its judgment in the defamation case. The court found that the reports published by the ABC and Fairfax Media were substantially true and dismissed Roberts-Smith's claim for defamation.\n\n### Appeal\n\nRoberts-Smith appealed the decision to the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia. In November 2020, the Full Court upheld the original decision, finding that the reports published by the ABC and Fairfax Media were substantially true.\n\nFurther Controversy\n--------------------\n\nIn 2020, the Australian government announced that it would establish a royal commission to investigate allegations of war crimes committed by Australian soldiers in Afghanistan. The royal commission, led by Major General Paul Brereton, delivered its report in November 2020. The report found that there was credible evidence to support allegations of war crimes committed by Australian soldiers in Afghanistan, including the killing of unarmed civilians.\n\nPersonal Life\n-------------\n\nRoberts-Smith is married to Emma Groom, a former model and television presenter. The couple has two children together. Roberts-Smith is also a keen sportsman and has competed in various charity events, including the 2014 Australian Ironman triathlon.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nExternal Links\n---------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Ben_Roberts-Smith\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and family\n#Military career\n##Military decorations\n#Corporate career\n#Other activities\n#War crime allegations\n##Investigation\n#Defamation suit\n##Judgment\n##Appeal\n#Further controversy\n#Personal life\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The game took place on February 12, 2023, at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. The Kansas City Chiefs defeated the Philadelphia Eagles 38-35 in a thrilling contest that saw multiple records broken and a dramatic finish.\n\n# Background\n\n## Host selection\n\nState Farm Stadium was selected as the host site for Super Bowl LVII on May 23, 2018, at the NFL Spring League Meeting in Atlanta, Georgia. The stadium, which is home to the Arizona Cardinals, was chosen over the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida, and the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\n## Calls for location change\n\nIn the months leading up to the game, there were calls to relocate the Super Bowl due to concerns over the treatment of Indigenous peoples in Arizona. However, the NFL ultimately decided to keep the game in Glendale, citing the efforts of the state and the team to address these issues.\n\n## Indigenous representation\n\nThe NFL and the Arizona Cardinals worked together to incorporate Indigenous representation into the Super Bowl festivities. This included the inclusion of Indigenous performers and artists in the pre-game and halftime shows, as well as the use of Indigenous-inspired designs and imagery in the stadium and surrounding areas.\n\n## Stadium playing surface\n\nThe playing surface at State Farm Stadium was a natural grass field, which was installed specifically for the Super Bowl. The field was grown in a nearby facility and transported to the stadium in the days leading up to the game.\n\n# Teams\n\n## Kansas City Chiefs\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs entered the Super Bowl as the AFC champions, having defeated the Cincinnati Bengals in the AFC Championship Game. The team was led by quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who was looking to win his second Super Bowl ring. The Chiefs' offense was one of the most explosive in the league, with a deep receiving corps and a strong running game.\n\n## Philadelphia Eagles\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles entered the Super Bowl as the NFC champions, having defeated the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC Championship Game. The team was led by quarterback Jalen Hurts, who was looking to win his first Super Bowl ring. The Eagles' offense was balanced, with a strong running game and a solid passing attack.\n\n## Playoffs\n\nThe Chiefs and Eagles both had to navigate the NFL playoffs to reach the Super Bowl. The Chiefs defeated the Jacksonville Jaguars and the Cincinnati Bengals in the Divisional Round and AFC Championship Game, respectively. The Eagles defeated the New York Giants and the San Francisco 49ers in the Divisional Round and NFC Championship Game, respectively.\n\n## Pre-game notes\n\nThe Chiefs and Eagles both had significant injuries heading into the Super Bowl. The Chiefs were without several key players, including wide receiver Mecole Hardman and defensive end Frank Clark. The Eagles were without several key players, including defensive tackle Linval Joseph and linebacker Robert Quinn.\n\n# Broadcasting\n\n## United States\n\n### Television\n\nThe Super Bowl was broadcast on Fox in the United States. The game was called by play-by-play announcer Kevin Burkhardt and analyst Greg Olsen. The pre-game and halftime shows were hosted by a team of Fox personalities, including Terry Bradshaw and Howie Long.\n\n### Advertising\n\nThe Super Bowl is one of the most-watched television events in the world, and as such, it is a highly sought-after platform for advertisers. The cost of a 30-second commercial during the Super Bowl was reportedly around $7 million.\n\n### Ratings\n\nThe Super Bowl was watched by an estimated 114 million people in the United States, making it one of the most-watched television events in history.\n\n### Streaming\n\nThe Super Bowl was also available to stream online through various platforms, including the Fox Sports app and the NFL Sunday Ticket app.\n\n### Radio\n\nThe Super Bowl was broadcast on radio by Westwood One, with play-by-play announcer Kevin Harlan and analyst Trent Green calling the game.\n\n## International\n\nThe Super Bowl was broadcast in over 180 countries around the world, with the game being translated into multiple languages.\n\n# Entertainment\n\n## Pregame\n\nThe pre-game show featured a performance by country music star Chris Stapleton, who sang the national anthem.

The show also included a performance by DJ Khaled, who served as the opening act.\n\n# Game summary\n\n## First half\n\nThe game got off to a slow start, with both teams struggling to move the ball. However, the Chiefs eventually got on the board with a field goal in the second quarter. The Eagles responded with a touchdown, but the Chiefs answered with a touchdown of their own. The Eagles added a field goal late in the half to take a 10-7 lead.\n\n## Second half\n\nThe second half was a back-and-forth affair, with both teams trading touchdowns and field goals.

However, the Chiefs drove down the field and scored a touchdown with just seconds left to take the lead for good.\n\n## Box score\n\nKansas City Chiefs at Philadelphia Eagles\n\n* Date: February 12, 2023\n* Stadium: State Farm Stadium, Glendale, Arizona\n* Attendance: 67,827\n* Referee: Carl Cheffers\n\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | Total |\n| Kansas City Chiefs | 7 | 0 | 14 | 17 | 38 |\n| Philadelphia Eagles | 10 | 7 | 14 | 4 | 35 |\n\n# Final statistics\n\n## Statistical comparison\n\nThe Chiefs and Eagles had similar statistics in the game, with both teams gaining over 400 yards of total offense.

The inquiry was initiated by the House of Representatives and was led by the House Intelligence Committee, in conjunction with the House Oversight and Reform Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee.\n\nBackground\n-----------\n\nThe impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden was sparked by a whistleblower complaint that was filed in August 2019. The complaint alleged that Biden had engaged in improper behavior during a phone call with the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he pressured Zelensky to investigate Biden's political rival, Donald Trump, and his son Hunter Biden. The whistleblower also alleged that Biden had conditioned military aid to Ukraine on the country's agreement to investigate the Bidens.\n\nInitiation of the Inquiry\n------------------------\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee, led by Chairman Adam Schiff, launched an investigation into the whistleblower complaint on September 9, 2019. The committee issued a subpoena to the White House, demanding that it turn over documents related to the phone call between Biden and Zelensky. The White House refused to comply with the subpoena, citing executive privilege.\n\nHouse Committee Investigations\n-----------------------------\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee, in conjunction with the House Oversight and Reform Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee, conducted a series of hearings and interviews with witnesses related to the impeachment inquiry. The witnesses included:\n\n* Alexander Vindman, a National Security Council official who was present on the phone call between Biden and Zelensky\n* Fiona Hill, a former National Security Council official who worked on Ukraine policy\n* David Holmes, a State Department official who overheard a conversation between Biden and the U.S. Ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland\n* Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine who was recalled from her post in May 2019\n\nWitness Credibility\n-------------------\n\nThe credibility of the witnesses who testified during the impeachment inquiry was a subject of debate. Some Republicans questioned the motives and credibility of the witnesses, while Democrats argued that they were credible and had provided important information about Biden's actions.\n\n### Alexander Smirnov\n\nAlexander Smirnov, a Russian-born businessman, was a key witness in the impeachment inquiry. Smirnov had business dealings with Hunter Biden, and had also met with Biden on several occasions. Smirnov testified that he had never discussed business with Biden, but had instead talked to him about his father's presidential campaign. However, some Republicans questioned Smirnov's credibility, pointing out that he had a history of making false statements.\n\nResponses\n----------\n\nThe impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden sparked a wide range of reactions from politicians, academics, and the general public.\n\n### Republican Reaction\n\nMany Republicans defended Biden and argued that the impeachment inquiry was a partisan witch hunt. They pointed out that the whistleblower complaint was based on second-hand information and that the witnesses who testified during the inquiry had provided conflicting testimony. Some Republicans also argued that Biden's actions were justified, given the widespread corruption in Ukraine and the need to investigate the Bidens' business dealings.\n\n### Democratic Reaction\n\nDemocrats, on the other hand, argued that the impeachment inquiry was necessary to hold Biden accountable for his actions. They pointed out that the witnesses who testified during the inquiry had provided credible testimony about Biden's behavior and that the evidence suggested that he had engaged in impeachable offenses. Some Democrats also argued that the impeachment inquiry was not just about Biden, but about the need to protect the Constitution and the rule of law.\n\n### Reaction from Academics\n\nAcademics and legal experts were divided on the question of whether Biden's actions constituted impeachable offenses. Some argued that his behavior was a clear abuse of power and that he had violated his oath of office. Others argued that the evidence was not sufficient to support impeachment and that the inquiry was a partisan exercise.\n\nAnalysis\n----------\n\nThe impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden raised a number of important legal and constitutional questions. One of the key questions was whether Biden's actions constituted impeachable offenses.\n\n### Legal Standing\n\nThe Constitution provides that the President can be impeached for \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.\" However, it does not provide a clear definition of what constitutes an impeachable offense. In the past, Congress has impeached presidents for a wide range of offenses, including perjury, obstruction of justice, and abuse of power.\n\nOpinion Polling\n----------------\n\nThe impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden was widely covered in the media, and public opinion was sharply divided on the question of whether he should be impeached.\n\n### Support for Inquiry\n\nA majority of Americans supported the impeachment inquiry, with 53% of respondents to a Pew Research Center poll saying that they approved of the inquiry. However, support for the inquiry was highly partisan, with 81% of Democrats supporting it and just 22% of Republicans.\n\n### Support for Impeachment\n\nHowever, support for impeachment was lower, with just 44% of respondents to a Gallup poll saying that they supported impeaching Biden. Again, support for impeachment was highly partisan, with 72% of Democrats supporting it and just 11% of Republicans.\n\nOutcome\n---------\n\nThe impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden was ongoing at the time of writing, and it was unclear what the ultimate outcome would be. However, it was clear that the inquiry had already had a significant impact on the country, sparking a wide range of reactions and debates about the Constitution, the rule of law, and the role of the President.\n\nNotes\n------\n\nThis article is a neutral, factual summary of the impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden.

Other notable tracks on the album include \"I Hate U,\" a melancholic R&B ballad, and \"Kill Bill,\" a high-energy hip hop track that incorporates elements of rock music.\n\n#Title and artwork\n\nThe title of the album, SOS, is a reference to the international distress signal used in emergency situations. In an interview with Rolling Stone, SZA explained the meaning behind the title, stating that she had been feeling \"lost and alone\" during the writing and production process, and that the title reflected her desire to \"send out a signal\" for help.\n\nThe album's artwork features a photograph of SZA taken by Craig McDean, with the title of the album written in bold, red letters. The artwork has been praised for its bold and striking design, which reflects the album's experimental and eclectic approach.\n\n#Promotion\n\nSOS was promoted through a variety of channels, including social media, music streaming platforms, and live performances. SZA performed several tracks from the album on Saturday Night Live in December 2022, and also appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.\n\nThe album's lead single, \"Good Days,\" was released in October 2022, and was accompanied by a music video directed by SZA herself.
