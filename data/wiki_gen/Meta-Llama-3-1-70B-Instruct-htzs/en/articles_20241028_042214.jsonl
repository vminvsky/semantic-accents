The issue began in a government college in Udupi and spread to other institutions across the state, sparking a heated debate on religious freedom, secularism, and the role of the state in regulating dress codes.\n\n#Background\n\nThe hijab has been a part of the traditional attire of Muslim women in India for centuries. In Karnataka, Muslim women have been wearing the hijab as part of their uniform in educational institutions without any issues. However, in recent years, there has been a growing trend of right-wing groups and individuals advocating for a ban on the hijab in public spaces, citing reasons such as promoting secularism and preventing the \"Islamization\" of public institutions.\n\n#Events\n\n##Udupi dispute\n\nThe controversy began in January 2022 at the Government Pre-University College in Udupi, where a group of six Muslim students were denied entry to the college for wearing the hijab. The college authorities claimed that the hijab was not part of the uniform and would \"disturb\" the other students. The students, however, argued that they had been wearing the hijab to the college for years without any issues and that it was an essential part of their religious attire.\n\n##Saffron protests\n\nIn response to the hijab controversy, right-wing groups and individuals, including those affiliated with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), began protesting outside the college, demanding a ban on the hijab. The protesters, many of whom were wearing saffron scarves and carrying saffron flags, claimed that the hijab was a symbol of \"Islamic fundamentalism\" and that it would \"destabilize\" the social fabric of the state.\n\n##Government reaction\n\nThe Karnataka government, led by Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, initially maintained a neutral stance on the issue. However, as the protests escalated, the government began to take a more hardline stance, with the Chief Minister stating that the hijab was not allowed in educational institutions as it was not part of the uniform.\n\n##Fallout\n\nThe hijab controversy soon spread to other educational institutions across Karnataka, with many colleges and schools banning the hijab. The issue also sparked a heated debate on social media, with many individuals and groups weighing in on the issue. The controversy also had a significant impact on the Muslim community in Karnataka, with many Muslim women feeling marginalized and excluded from public spaces.\n\n#Petitions in the High Court\n\n##Religious rights\n\nA group of Muslim students and parents filed a petition in the Karnataka High Court, challenging the ban on the hijab in educational institutions. The petitioners argued that the ban was a violation of their fundamental right to freedom of religion, as guaranteed by the Indian Constitution.\n\n##Government order\n\nThe government, in its response to the petition, argued that the ban on the hijab was necessary to maintain public order and to prevent \"communal tensions.\" The government also argued that the hijab was not an essential part of Islam and that it was not a fundamental right.\n\n##College development committees\n\nThe High Court also heard arguments from college development committees, which argued that the ban on the hijab was necessary to maintain discipline and order in educational institutions.\n\n##Udupi college and other institutions\n\nThe High Court also heard arguments from the Udupi college and other institutions that had banned the hijab, which argued that the ban was necessary to prevent \"disturbances\" and to maintain the \"sanctity\" of the educational institutions.\n\n#High Court verdict\n\nThe Karnataka High Court delivered its verdict on March 15, 2022, upholding the ban on the hijab in educational institutions. The court ruled that the hijab was not an essential part of Islam and that it was not a fundamental right. The court also ruled that the ban on the hijab was necessary to maintain public order and to prevent \"communal tensions.\"\n\n#Supreme Court\n\nThe petitioners filed an appeal in the Supreme Court of India, challenging the High Court's verdict. The Supreme Court heard arguments in the case and reserved its judgment. The Supreme Court's verdict is still pending.\n\n#Violence\n\nThe hijab controversy also led to instances of violence and intimidation against Muslim women who wore the hijab. Many Muslim women reported being harassed and intimidated by right-wing groups and individuals, and some were even physically attacked.\n\n#Reactions\n\n##Domestic\n\nThe hijab controversy sparked a heated debate on social media, with many individuals and groups weighing in on the issue. Many Indians expressed support for the Muslim women who were fighting for their right to wear the hijab, while others expressed opposition to the hijab, citing reasons such as promoting secularism and preventing the \"Islamization\" of public institutions.\n\n##International\n\nThe hijab controversy also attracted international attention, with many countries and international organizations expressing concern over the issue. The United Nations, for example, expressed concern over the ban on the hijab, stating that it was a violation of the fundamental right to freedom of religion.\n\n##Ministry of External Affairs (MEA)\n\nThe Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) responded to international criticism of the hijab ban, stating that the issue was an internal matter and that India was committed to protecting the rights of all its citizens, including Muslim women.\n\n#Impact\n\nThe hijab controversy had a significant impact on the Muslim community in Karnataka, with many Muslim women feeling marginalized and excluded from public spaces. The controversy also had a significant impact on the social fabric of the state, with many individuals and groups expressing concern over the growing trend of right-wing extremism and intolerance.\n\n#Rescission\n\nIn the aftermath of the High Court's verdict, the Karnataka government announced that it would set up a committee to review the ban on the hijab and to explore ways to resolve the issue. However, the committee's report is still pending, and the ban on the hijab remains in place.\n\n#See also\n\n* Freedom of religion in India\n* Secularism in India\n* Islam in India\n* Hijab\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is a factual account of the 2022 Karnataka hijab row and does not express any opinion or bias on the issue.\n\n#References\n\nThis article does not include any references or citations.\n\n#Bibliography\n\nThis article does not include any bibliography.\n\n#External links\n\nThis article does not include any external links.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Karnataka_hijab_row\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Events\n##Udupi dispute\n##Saffron protests\n##Government reaction\n##Fallout\n#Petitions in the High Court\n##Religious rights\n##Government order\n##College development committees\n##Udupi college and other institutions\n#High Court verdict\n#Supreme Court\n#Violence\n#Reactions\n##Domestic\n##International\n##Ministry of External Affairs (MEA)\n#Impact\n#Rescission\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The county palatine was a unique entity that possessed a significant degree of autonomy and privilege, with its own system of government, laws, and administration. At its peak, the County Palatine of Durham was one of the most powerful and influential counties in England, playing a crucial role in the country's history and development.\n\n# History\n\n## Early History\n\nThe history of the County Palatine of Durham dates back to the 7th century when the Kingdom of Northumbria was established. The kingdom was divided into several smaller kingdoms, including the Kingdom of Bernicia, which covered much of present-day County Durham. In the 9th century, the Kingdom of Northumbria was conquered by the Vikings, and the area was incorporated into the Danelaw. Following the Norman Conquest of England in 1066, the area was granted to William de St-Calais, the Bishop of Durham, by William the Conqueror.\n\n## Establishment and Consolidation\n\nThe County Palatine of Durham was formally established in the 11th century, with the Bishop of Durham as its ruler. The bishop possessed a unique combination of spiritual and temporal powers, which allowed him to govern the county with a significant degree of autonomy. The county palatine was responsible for its own defense, law enforcement, and administration, with the bishop serving as the chief justice and military commander. The county's unique status was confirmed by the Magna Carta in 1215, which recognized the bishop's authority and privileges.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, the County Palatine of Durham played a significant role in English history, particularly during the Wars of the Roses. The county was a key stronghold for the Lancastrian faction, and the bishop's forces played a crucial role in several battles. The county's strategic location and rich resources made it an attractive prize for rival factions, and it was frequently contested and besieged.\n\n## Decline and Abolition\n\nThe County Palatine of Durham began to decline in the 16th century, as the English monarchy began to centralize power and reduce the autonomy of the county palatines. The bishop's powers were gradually eroded, and the county's unique status was gradually reduced. The English Civil War marked a significant turning point in the county's history, as the bishop's forces supported the Royalist cause and were defeated by the Parliamentarian forces.\n\nThe County Palatine of Durham was formally abolished in 1836, as part of a broader reform of local government in England. The county's unique status and privileges were abolished, and it was incorporated into the newly created County of Durham. The bishop's powers were significantly reduced, and the county was governed by a newly established county council.\n\n# Administration\n\n## Taxation\n\nThe County Palatine of Durham possessed its own system of taxation, which was based on the medieval system of feudalism. The county was divided into several smaller units, including manors and townships, which were responsible for collecting taxes and providing military service. The bishop possessed the power to raise taxes and impose fines, which were used to fund the county's administration and defense.\n\n## Government and Courts\n\nThe County Palatine of Durham possessed its own system of government and courts, which were based on the medieval system of feudalism. The bishop served as the chief justice and military commander, and was responsible for administering justice and maintaining law and order. The county had its own system of courts, including the Court of Chancery and the Court of Common Pleas, which heard cases and dispensed justice.\n\n# St Cuthbert and the haliwerfolc\n\nThe County Palatine of Durham was closely associated with St Cuthbert, a 7th-century saint who was revered throughout the county. The saint's relics were kept at Durham Cathedral, which was a major pilgrimage site during the Middle Ages. The haliwerfolc, or \"holy men's folk\", were a group of laymen who were responsible for protecting the saint's relics and maintaining the cathedral.\n\nThe haliwerfolc played a significant role in the county's history, particularly during the Viking raids and the Norman Conquest. They were responsible for defending the cathedral and the saint's relics, and were granted special privileges and powers by the bishop. The haliwerfolc were also responsible for maintaining the county's unique status and privileges, and played a crucial role in the county's government and administration.\n\n# Legacy\n\nThe County Palatine of Durham played a significant role in English history, particularly during the Middle Ages. The county's unique status and privileges made it an attractive prize for rival factions, and it was frequently contested and besieged. The county's strategic location and rich resources made it an important center of trade and commerce, and it played a crucial role in the country's economic development.\n\nThe county's legacy can still be seen today, particularly in the city of Durham and the surrounding countryside. The county's unique history and culture are still celebrated, and the city remains an important center of learning and culture. The county's unique status and privileges may have been abolished, but its legacy lives on as an important part of English history and identity.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"County_Palatine_of_Durham\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Early history\n##Establishment and consolidation\n##Decline and abolition\n#Administration\n##Taxation\n##Government and courts\n#St Cuthbert and the haliwerfolc\n#Legacy\n#References\n##Citations\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He is one of the most prominent and influential figures in Italian politics, known for his charismatic leadership style, media empire, and numerous controversies.\n\nFamily background and personal life\n--------------------------------\n\nBerlusconi was born on September 29, 1936, in Milan, Italy, to a middle-class family. His father, Luigi Berlusconi, was an accountant, and his mother, Rosa Bossi, was a housewife. Berlusconi has two siblings, a brother, Paolo Berlusconi, and a sister, Maria Antonietta Berlusconi. He married Carla Elvira Dall'Oglio in 1965, and they had two children, Maria Elvira Berlusconi and Pier Silvio Berlusconi. The couple divorced in 1985, and Berlusconi married Veronica Lario in 1990, with whom he had three children, Barbara Berlusconi, Eleonora Berlusconi, and Luigi Berlusconi. Berlusconi and Lario divorced in 2010.\n\nBusiness career\n--------------\n\n### Milano Due\n\nBerlusconi began his business career in the 1960s, developing residential and commercial properties in Milan. In 1968, he founded Milano Due, a real estate company that built a large residential complex in the outskirts of Milan. The project was a commercial success, and it established Berlusconi as a prominent figure in Italian real estate.\n\n### TeleMilano\n\nIn 1973, Berlusconi founded TeleMilano, a local television station that broadcast in the Lombardy region. The station was successful, and it became a prototype for Berlusconi's future media ventures.\n\n### Fininvest\n\nIn 1978, Berlusconi founded Fininvest, a holding company that controlled his various business interests, including real estate, media, and publishing. Fininvest became one of the largest and most influential companies in Italy, with interests in television, newspapers, magazines, and book publishing.\n\nPolitical career\n----------------\n\n### Beginnings\n\nBerlusconi entered politics in the late 1980s, when he was approached by Bettino Craxi, the leader of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI), to support his party's electoral campaign. Berlusconi provided financial support to the PSI, and in 1990, he was appointed as a member of the party's national council.\n\n### 1994 electoral victory\n\nIn 1994, Berlusconi founded Forza Italia (FI), a center-right party that contested the general election. Berlusconi's party won a surprise victory, and he became the Prime Minister of Italy. His government was short-lived, as it collapsed in December 1994 due to internal conflicts and opposition from the left.\n\n### Fall of the Berlusconi I Cabinet\n\nBerlusconi's first government was marked by controversy and scandal. In 1994, he was accused of corruption and Mafia ties, and he was forced to resign as Prime Minister. His successor, Lamberto Dini, formed a caretaker government that ruled until the 1996 general election.\n\n### 2001 electoral victory\n\nBerlusconi returned to power in 2001, when his party, Forza Italia, won the general election. He formed a coalition government with the Northern League and the National Alliance, and he became the Prime Minister of Italy for the second time.\n\n### Berlusconi II Cabinet\n\nBerlusconi's second government was marked by controversy and scandal. In 2002, he was accused of tax evasion, and in 2003, he was accused of corruption and bribery. Despite these scandals, Berlusconi's government remained in power until the 2006 general election.\n\n### Subsequent elections\n\nBerlusconi contested the 2006 general election, but his party, Forza Italia, lost to the center-left coalition led by Romano Prodi. Berlusconi returned to power in 2008, when his party, The People of Freedom (PdL), won the general election. He formed a coalition government with the Northern League and the Movement for Autonomy, and he became the Prime Minister of Italy for the third time.\n\n### Berlusconi III Cabinet\n\nBerlusconi's third government was marked by controversy and scandal. In 2009, he was accused of corruption and bribery, and in 2010, he was accused of sex trafficking and prostitution. Despite these scandals, Berlusconi's government remained in power until the 2011 European sovereign-debt crisis.\n\n### Attempt to reform the Italian constitution\n\nIn 2011, Berlusconi attempted to reform the Italian constitution, but his efforts were blocked by the opposition. He proposed a series of constitutional changes, including the abolition of the Senate and the creation of a presidential system.\n\n### 2006 general election and opposition\n\nBerlusconi contested the 2006 general election, but his party, Forza Italia, lost to the center-left coalition led by Romano Prodi.

It is one of the most widely spoken dialects of Arabic, with over 30 million speakers worldwide. Levantine Arabic has its own distinct grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation, which differ from Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and other dialects of Arabic.\n\n**Naming and classification**\n\nLevantine Arabic is often referred to as \"Shami\" in Arabic, which means \"Syrian\" or \"Levantine.\" However, this term is not commonly used in English, and \"Levantine Arabic\" is the preferred term. It is classified as a dialect of Arabic, which belongs to the Semitic branch of the Afro-Asiatic language family. Within the Arabic dialects, Levantine Arabic is part of the Eastern Arabic group, which also includes Iraqi Arabic and Gulf Arabic.\n\n**Geographical distribution and varieties**\n\nLevantine Arabic is spoken in the Levant region, which includes:\n\n## **Dialects**\n\nLevantine Arabic has several dialects, which can be broadly classified into three main groups:\n\n* **Northern Levantine Arabic**: Spoken in Syria, Lebanon, and parts of Turkey.\n* **Central Levantine Arabic**: Spoken in Jordan, Palestine, and parts of Israel.\n* **Southern Levantine Arabic**: Spoken in parts of Jordan, Palestine, and Israel.\n\nEach of these groups has its own distinct dialects and sub-dialects, which can vary significantly from one another.\n\n## **Ethnicity and religion**\n\nLevantine Arabic is spoken by people of various ethnic and religious backgrounds, including Arabs, Armenians, Kurds, and others. The majority of speakers are Muslims, but there are also significant Christian and Druze communities.\n\n## **Speakers by country**\n\n* **Lebanon**: Over 4 million speakers.\n* **Syria**: Over 15 million speakers.\n* **Jordan**: Over 6 million speakers.\n* **Palestine**: Over 2 million speakers.\n* **Turkey**: Over 1 million speakers.\n* **Iraq**: Over 1 million speakers.\n* **Israel**: Over 1 million speakers.\n\n**History**\n\nLevantine Arabic has a long and complex history, which dates back to the pre-Islamic era.\n\n## **Pre-Islamic antiquity**\n\nThe Levant region was inhabited by various ancient civilizations, including the Phoenicians, Canaanites, and Aramaeans. These civilizations spoke their own languages, which were part of the Semitic branch of the Afro-Asiatic language family.\n\n## **Muslim conquest of the Levant**\n\nIn the 7th century CE, the Levant region was conquered by the Arabs, who brought Islam and the Arabic language to the region. The Arabic language became the dominant language of the region, and it eventually replaced the local languages.\n\n## **Medieval and early modern era**\n\nDuring the medieval and early modern periods, Levantine Arabic developed distinct features and dialects, which were influenced by the various cultures and languages of the region.\n\n## **20th and 21st centuries**\n\nIn the 20th century, Levantine Arabic was influenced by Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), which was introduced in schools and media. However, Levantine Arabic remained the dominant dialect in the region, and it continues to be spoken by millions of people today.\n\n**Status and usage**\n\nLevantine Arabic is an important part of the cultural and social identity of the Levant region.\n\n## **Diglossia and code-switching**\n\nLevantine Arabic is often used in informal settings, such as at home, with friends, and in local markets. However, Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) is often used in formal settings, such as in education, media, and government. This creates a diglossic situation, where speakers switch between two languages or dialects depending on the context.\n\n## **Education**\n\nLevantine Arabic is not typically taught in schools, where Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) is the dominant language. However, there are efforts to promote the teaching of Levantine Arabic in schools and universities.\n\n## **Films and music**\n\nLevantine Arabic is often used in films and music, which are popular throughout the region. Many famous singers and actors from the Levant region use Levantine Arabic in their performances.\n\n## **Written media**\n\nLevantine Arabic is not typically written, as Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) is the dominant language in written media.

The system was classified as a tropical cyclone by the Mauritius Meteorological Services (MMS) and the French meteorological service, Météo-France.\n\n#Meteorological history\n\nCyclone Batsirai originated from a low-pressure system that formed on January 24, 2022, in the central Indian Ocean, approximately 1,000 km (620 mi) east of the Seychelles. The system gradually intensified as it moved west-southwestwards, fueled by warm waters and low wind shear. On January 27, the MMS classified the system as a tropical disturbance, and by January 29, it had strengthened into a tropical depression.\n\nOver the next few days, the system continued to intensify, and on February 1, the MMS upgraded it to a tropical cyclone, naming it Batsirai. The cyclone's maximum sustained winds reached 165 km/h (105 mph) on February 2, making it a Category 3 tropical cyclone on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.\n\nBatsirai's track was influenced by a high-pressure system to its south, which caused it to move west-southwestwards towards the Mascarene Islands. On February 3, the cyclone passed approximately 100 km (62 mi) north of Mauritius, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall to the island.\n\n#Preparations\n\n##Mauritius\n\nIn anticipation of the cyclone's arrival, the Mauritian government issued a Class 4 cyclone warning on February 2, the highest level of warning. Schools and non-essential services were closed, and residents were advised to stock up on food and water.\n\nThe government also set up emergency centers and shelters for those in need. The Mauritius Meteorological Services issued regular updates and warnings, and the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Centre (NDRRMC) coordinated the response efforts.\n\n##Madagascar\n\nIn Madagascar, the government issued a cyclone warning on February 1, and the National Office for Disaster Risk Management (BNGRC) activated its emergency response plan.\n\nThe BNGRC worked with local authorities to evacuate people from low-lying areas and to distribute emergency supplies. The government also set up a crisis management center to coordinate the response efforts.\n\n#Impact\n\n##Mauritius\n\nCyclone Batsirai brought severe weather conditions to Mauritius, with sustained winds of up to 120 km/h (75 mph) and heavy rainfall. The cyclone caused widespread damage to buildings, roads, and infrastructure.\n\nThe island's power grid was severely affected, with over 100,000 households losing electricity. The water supply was also disrupted, and several areas were left without access to clean drinking water.\n\n##Réunion\n\nAlthough Batsirai did not directly affect Réunion, the island experienced strong winds and heavy rainfall due to the cyclone's outer rain bands. The French meteorological service, Météo-France, issued a yellow alert for the island, and residents were advised to take necessary precautions.\n\n##Madagascar\n\nCyclone Batsirai made landfall in Madagascar on February 5, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall to the eastern coast. The cyclone caused widespread damage to buildings, roads, and infrastructure, particularly in the Mananjary and Vangaindrano districts.\n\nThe cyclone also caused significant flooding, with several rivers overflowing their banks. The government reported that over 10,000 households were affected, and several people were injured.\n\n#Aftermath\n\n##Mauritius\n\nIn the aftermath of the cyclone, the Mauritian government launched a relief effort to assist those affected. The government distributed emergency supplies, including food, water, and shelter materials.\n\nThe Mauritius Meteorological Services worked to restore the power grid, and the water supply was gradually restored. The government also established a task force to assess the damage and to develop a plan for reconstruction.\n\n##Madagascar\n\nIn Madagascar, the government launched a relief effort to assist those affected by the cyclone. The government distributed emergency supplies, including food, water, and shelter materials.\n\nThe government also established a crisis management center to coordinate the response efforts. The center worked with local authorities and humanitarian organizations to provide assistance to those in need.\n\n###International response\n\nThe international community responded to the cyclone by providing assistance to those affected. The European Union provided €1 million in emergency funding to support the relief efforts in Madagascar.\n\nThe United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) also provided assistance, including emergency supplies and technical support.\n\n#See also\n\n* List of tropical cyclones\n* Cyclone season\n\n#Notes\n\n#References\n\n#External links\n\n* Mauritius Meteorological Services\n* Météo-France\n* National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Centre (NDRRMC)\n* National Office for Disaster Risk Management (BNGRC)\n* United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Cyclone_Batsirai\" following this outline:\n\n#Meteorological history\n#Preparations\n##Mauritius\n##Madagascar\n#Impact\n##Mauritius\n##Réunion\n##Madagascar\n#Aftermath\n##Mauritius\n##Madagascar\n###International response\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is centered around an anonymous individual or group of individuals, known as \"Q,\" who claim to have access to classified information and are working to expose a global cabal of powerful individuals and organizations. QAnon has been linked to various violent incidents, including the January 6, 2021, storming of the United States Capitol, and has been designated as a domestic terrorism threat by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).\n\nBackground\n----------\n\n### Pizzagate\n\nQAnon's roots can be traced back to the Pizzagate conspiracy theory, which emerged in 2016. Pizzagate claimed that high-ranking officials in the Democratic Party, including Hillary Clinton, were involved in a child sex trafficking ring operating out of a pizza parlor in Washington, D.C. Although Pizzagate was thoroughly debunked, it laid the groundwork for QAnon's more elaborate conspiracy theories.\n\n### Influence of 4chan culture\n\nQAnon also draws heavily from 4chan culture, a platform known for its anonymous posting and meme-driven discussions. 4chan's /pol/ board, in particular, has been a breeding ground for conspiracy theories and far-right ideologies. QAnon's use of cryptic messages, codes, and puzzles is reminiscent of 4chan's style of communication.\n\n### Previous \"anons\"\n\nThe name \"QAnon\" is also a nod to previous anonymous figures, such as \"FBIAnon\" and \"CIAAnon,\" who claimed to be insiders with access to classified information. These earlier figures were often dismissed as hoaxes or disinformation campaigns, but they helped to establish the template for QAnon's persona and style.\n\nOrigin and Spread\n-----------------\n\n### Mainstream attention\n\nQAnon first gained mainstream attention in 2018, when a series of cryptic posts on 4chan's /pol/ board began to attract attention from conspiracy theorists and far-right activists. The posts, attributed to \"Q,\" claimed to reveal information about a deep state plot to overthrow President Donald Trump and cover up a range of crimes, including child sex trafficking and murder.\n\n### International following\n\nQAnon quickly gained an international following, with supporters in countries such as the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia. The movement's online presence was fueled by social media platforms, including Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube.\n\n### Pastel QAnon\n\nIn 2020, a new variant of QAnon emerged, known as \"Pastel QAnon.\" This iteration of the movement toned down some of the more extreme language and imagery associated with QAnon, instead emphasizing themes of patriotism, nationalism, and family values. Pastel QAnon was seen as an attempt to rebrand the movement and make it more palatable to a wider audience.\n\nClaims\n------\n\n### Q's posts\n\nQAnon's claims are based on a series of posts, known as \"Q drops,\" which are attributed to the anonymous figure or figures known as \"Q.\" These posts often contain cryptic messages, codes, and puzzles that are intended to reveal information about a range of topics, including politics, finance, and entertainment.\n\n### The cabal and \"the Storm\"\n\nAt the heart of QAnon's conspiracy theories is the idea of a global cabal of powerful individuals and organizations that are working together to control world events. This cabal is said to be responsible for a range of crimes, including child sex trafficking, murder, and financial manipulation. QAnon claims that a group of patriots, led by President Trump, are working to take down the cabal and restore justice to the world. This event is often referred to as \"the Storm.\"\n\n### Child sex trafficking and satanic sacrifice\n\nQAnon places a strong emphasis on the issue of child sex trafficking, claiming that it is a widespread problem that is perpetuated by the cabal. The movement also claims that some members of the cabal are involved in satanic rituals and human sacrifice.\n\n### Other QAnon beliefs\n\nQAnon's conspiracy theories are diverse and far-reaching, encompassing a range of topics, including:\n\n* The idea that the 9/11 attacks were an inside job\n* The claim that the moon landing was faked\n* The belief that vaccines are part of a plot to control the population\n* The idea that a range of celebrities and public figures are involved in the cabal\n\nAnalysis\n--------\n\n### Identity of Q\n\nThe true identity of Q remains a mystery, and it is unclear whether Q is a single individual or a group of people. Some researchers have suggested that Q may be a team of individuals, possibly with ties to the military or intelligence agencies.\n\n### Multiple people\n\nSome analysis suggests that Q's posts are written in different styles, which could indicate that multiple people are involved in creating the content.\n\n### Paul Furber and the Watkins family\n\nIn 2020, it was reported that Paul Furber, a South African software developer, was behind the QAnon movement. Furber denied the allegations, but some researchers believe that he may have been involved in creating the Q persona. The Watkins family, who own the 8chan platform where Q's posts first appeared, have also been linked to the movement.\n\n### Slogans and vocabulary\n\nQAnon has developed its own unique set of slogans and vocabulary, including phrases such as \"Where we go one, we go all\" and \"Trust the plan.\"\n\n### Derivative elements\n\nQAnon's ideology draws on a range of sources, including:\n\n* Christian themes: QAnon often incorporates Christian imagery and themes, such as the idea of a final reckoning or a battle between good and evil.\n* Antisemitism: Some QAnon adherents have been accused of promoting antisemitic conspiracy theories, such as the idea that Jewish people are behind the cabal.\n\n### Appeal\n\nQAnon's appeal can be attributed to a range of factors, including:\n\n* Disillusionment: Many people are disillusioned with the current state of politics and society, and QAnon offers a narrative that explains the problems and offers a solution.\n* Sense of community: QAnon provides a sense of community and belonging for its adherents, who often feel like they are part of a secret club or movement.\n\n### Demographics\n\nQAnon's demographics are diverse, but some research suggests that the movement is more popular among:\n\n* White men\n* Conservatives and libertarians\n* People with lower levels of education\n\nIncidents\n--------\n\n### Attempts to overturn the 2020 U.S. election\n\nQAnon was linked to several incidents related to the 2020 U.S. presidential election, including attempts to overturn the results in several states.\n\n### German coup attempt\n\nIn 2022, a group of QAnon adherents were involved in a failed coup attempt in Germany, which aimed to overthrow the government and install a new regime.\n\nReactions\n---------\n\n### Media, advocacy groups, and public figures\n\nQAnon has been widely condemned by media outlets, advocacy groups, and public figures, who see it as a threat to democracy and public safety.\n\n### Official responses\n\n* FBI domestic terrorism assessment: In 2019, the FBI designated QAnon as a domestic terrorism threat, citing the movement's potential for violence and extremism.\n* Congressional resolution: In 2020, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a resolution condemning QAnon and its ideology.\n\n### Republican politicians and organizations\n\nSome Republican politicians and organizations have been linked to QAnon, either through their rhetoric or their actions.\n\n### Connected individuals\n\n* Donald Trump: President Trump has been accused of promoting QAnon's ideology, although he has denied any direct connection to the movement.\n* Mike Pence: Vice President Pence has also been linked to QAnon, although he has denied any involvement.\n* Michael Flynn: Former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn has been a prominent supporter of QAnon, and has appeared at several QAnon events.\n* Lin Wood: Lawyer Lin Wood has been a vocal supporter of QAnon, and has represented several QAnon adherents in court cases.\n* Sidney Powell: Lawyer Sidney Powell has also been linked to QAnon, and has promoted several QAnon conspiracy theories.\n* Kelly Townsend: Arizona state Representative Kelly Townsend has been a vocal supporter of QAnon, and has promoted several QAnon conspiracy theories.\n* Liz Harris: Arizona state Representative Liz Harris has also been linked to QAnon, and has promoted several QAnon conspiracy theories.\n\nOnline\n------\n\n### QDrops app\n\nThe QDrops app is a mobile application that allows users to access Q's posts and other QAnon content.\n\n### Anti-QAnon subreddits\n\nSeveral subreddits have been created to counter QAnon's ideology and provide a platform for critics and skeptics.\n\n### Removal of content\n\nSeveral social media platforms have removed QAnon content, citing concerns about hate speech and extremism.\n\n### Migration to alt-tech\n\nQAnon adherents have migrated to alternative social media platforms, such as Gab and Parler, which have more lenient moderation policies.\n\n### Return to Twitter/X\n\nIn 2022, QAnon adherents began to return to Twitter, which had previously banned the movement's content.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Conspiracy theories\n* Far-right politics\n* Extremism\n* Terrorism\n\nFurther reading\n---------------\n\n* \"The QAnon Conspiracy Theory: A

The election was originally scheduled for June 18, 2023, but was brought forward to May 14, 2023, by the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP). The election was the third direct presidential election in Turkish history, following the transition from a parliamentary system to a presidential system in 2018.\n\n#Background\n\n##2018 elections\n\nThe 2018 Turkish presidential election was held on June 24, 2018, in which Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was re-elected as President of Turkey. The election was the first to be held under the new presidential system, which was introduced by a constitutional referendum in 2017.

He has served on the Court since 1991, after being nominated by President George H.W. Bush. Thomas is known for his conservative and originalist judicial philosophy, and has been a key figure in shaping the Court's decisions on various constitutional and statutory issues.\n\n# Early life\n\nClarence Thomas was born on June 23, 1948, in Pin Point, Georgia, to M.C. Thomas and Leola Williams Thomas. He grew up in a poor Gullah Geechee community, and his early life was marked by hardship and struggle. Thomas's father abandoned the family when he was young, and his mother remarried, but the family continued to face financial difficulties.\n\nDespite the challenges he faced, Thomas excelled academically and was an active member of his community. He attended Conception Seminary College, a Catholic seminary in Missouri, before transferring to the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts. Thomas graduated from Holy Cross in 1971, and then attended Yale Law School, where he earned his Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree in 1974.\n\n## College of the Holy Cross and Yale Law School\n\nThomas's time at Holy Cross and Yale Law School had a profound impact on his intellectual and personal development. At Holy Cross, he was exposed to the ideas of Catholic social teaching and the civil rights movement, which shaped his views on social justice and equality. At Yale Law School, Thomas was influenced by the work of conservative scholars such as Alexander Bickel and Robert Bork, who emphasized the importance of originalism and judicial restraint.\n\n# Early legal career\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Thomas clerked for Judge John A. Danaher of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. He then worked in the Missouri Attorney General's office and later as an assistant secretary for civil rights in the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nIn 1982, Thomas became the chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), a position he held until 1990. During his tenure at the EEOC, Thomas developed a reputation as a strong advocate for conservative principles and limited government intervention in the economy.\n\n# District of Columbia Court of Appeals\n\nIn 1990, Thomas was nominated by President George H.W. Bush to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. He was confirmed by the Senate and served on the court for 16 months before being nominated to the Supreme Court.\n\n# Nomination to the Supreme Court\n\nIn July 1991, President Bush nominated Thomas to replace retiring Justice Thurgood Marshall on the Supreme Court. Thomas's nomination was met with opposition from liberal groups and some Democrats, who questioned his views on civil rights and abortion.\n\n## Anita Hill accusations\n\nDuring Thomas's confirmation hearings, Anita Hill, a former EEOC employee, accused him of sexual harassment. Hill alleged that Thomas had made unwanted advances and comments to her while she worked under him at the EEOC.\n\nThomas denied the allegations, and the hearings became a contentious and dramatic spectacle. Thomas's supporters argued that the accusations were unfounded and part of a larger effort to discredit him.\n\n### Second hearing\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee held a second hearing to investigate the allegations, during which Thomas and Hill testified. Thomas's testimony was marked by his famous phrase \"high-tech lynching,\" in which he described the hearings as a racist and unfair attack on his character.\n\n## Senate votes\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding Thomas's nomination, he was confirmed by the Senate on October 15, 1991, with a vote of 52-48.\n\n# Supreme Court of the United States\n\nThomas has served on the Supreme Court for over 30 years, during which time he has developed a reputation as a conservative and originalist justice.\n\n## Government powers and legal structure\n\nThomas has been a strong advocate for limited government and judicial restraint.

He has argued that the Constitution grants the President significant discretion and authority to act in the interests of national security and foreign policy.\n\n### Federalism and states' rights\n\nThomas has been a strong advocate for federalism and states' rights, arguing that the Constitution grants significant authority to the states and limits the power of the federal government. He has consistently voted to uphold the rights of states to regulate their own affairs and to limit the power of the federal government to intrude on state sovereignty.\n\n## Individual rights\n\nThomas has been a strong advocate for individual rights, particularly in the areas of free speech, gun rights, and the rights of the accused.\n\n### First Amendment\n\nThomas has been a strong supporter of the First Amendment, arguing that it protects a broad range of speech and expression.

He has consistently voted to uphold the rights of individuals to be treated fairly and to limit the power of the government to intrude on state sovereignty.\n\n### Abortion and family planning\n\nThomas has been a strong opponent of abortion, arguing that it is a violation of the right to life protected by the Constitution. He has consistently voted to uphold laws that limit access to abortion and to limit the power of the government to fund abortion providers.\n\n### LGBTQ rights\n\nThomas has been a strong opponent of LGBTQ rights, arguing that they are not protected by the Constitution. He has consistently voted to uphold laws that limit the rights of LGBTQ individuals and to limit the power of the government to recognize same-sex marriage.\n\n## Oral arguments\n\nThomas is known for his limited participation in oral arguments, often going years without asking a question. He has argued that oral arguments are not an effective way to gather information and that justices should rely more on the written record.\n\n# Personal life\n\nThomas is married to Virginia Lamp Thomas, a conservative activist and lobbyist.

He was best known for his role as the founder and CEO of Wenner Media, a privately held media company that published Rolling Stone magazine, among other titles. Wenner's life and career were marked by both significant successes and controversies, which ultimately led to a dramatic and mysterious conclusion.\n\n# Biography\n\nMax Wenner was born on June 30, 1936, in Manhattan, New York City, to a family of German Jewish immigrants. His parents, Sigrid and Leo Wenner, had fled Nazi Germany in the 1930s and settled in the United States. Wenner's early life was marked by a privileged upbringing, with his family residing in a luxurious apartment on the Upper East Side.\n\nWenner developed an interest in journalism at a young age and attended the prestigious Horace Mann School in the Bronx. He later enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley, where he studied English literature and began writing for the college newspaper. After graduating in 1958, Wenner worked as a journalist for several publications, including the San Francisco Chronicle and the New York Herald Tribune.\n\nIn 1967, Wenner co-founded Rolling Stone magazine with Ralph Gleason, a music critic and journalist. The magazine quickly gained a reputation for its in-depth coverage of rock music and counterculture, and Wenner's editorial vision helped shape the publication's distinctive voice and style. Under Wenner's leadership, Rolling Stone became one of the most influential and widely read magazines of its time, with a circulation of over one million copies per issue.\n\nWenner's success with Rolling Stone led to the establishment of Wenner Media, a privately held company that published several other titles, including Us Weekly and Men's Journal. Wenner served as CEO and chairman of the board, overseeing the company's operations and editorial direction.\n\nThroughout his career, Wenner was known for his strong personality and demanding management style. He was a perfectionist who pushed his employees to produce high-quality work, often under tight deadlines. While some colleagues admired Wenner's passion and dedication, others found him difficult to work with, citing his volatile temper and tendency to micromanage.\n\n# Death\n\n## Disappearance\n\nOn August 15, 2005, Max Wenner disappeared from his home in Manhattan. His wife, Jane Wenner, reported him missing when he failed to return from a walk in Central Park. A police investigation was launched, and authorities searched the park and surrounding areas but found no sign of Wenner.\n\n## Discovery\n\nOn August 20, 2005, a park ranger discovered Wenner's body in a wooded area of Central Park, near the reservoir. The body was found in a state of decomposition, and authorities later confirmed that it was Wenner through dental records.\n\n## Autopsy\n\nThe autopsy report revealed tha", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Max_Wenner\" following this outline:\n\n#Biography\n#Death\n##Disappearance\n##Discovery\n##Autopsy\n##Investigation\n##Estate\n##Burial\n##Aftermath\n#Legacy\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The storm was particularly devastating in the United States and Canada, where it caused numerous deaths, disruptions to critical infrastructure, and significant economic losses.\n\n# Meteorological history\n\nThe winter storm developed on December 19, 2022, over the Rocky Mountains, where a low-pressure system formed and began to strengthen. The system tapped into a mass of cold Arctic air that had been building over Canada, causing the storm to rapidly intensify as it moved eastward. By December 21, the storm had grown into a massive winter storm, spanning over 2,000 miles (3,200 km) from the Great Plains to the Eastern Seaboard.\n\nAs the storm moved eastward, it brought heavy snowfall to the Midwest and Northeast, with some areas receiving over 2 feet (60 cm) of snow. The storm also produced significant freezing rain, which caused widespread power outages and made travel extremely hazardous.\n\n# Preparations\n\nIn anticipation of the storm, officials across North America took steps to prepare for the worst. Governments issued winter storm warnings and advisories, and emergency management officials activated emergency response plans. Airlines cancelled flights, and transportation agencies reduced service or suspended operations altogether.\n\nMany schools and businesses closed in advance of the storm, and some cities implemented snow emergency plans, restricting non-essential travel and imposing parking bans. Utility companies and emergency responders prepared for the possibility of widespread power outages, stockpiling equipment and personnel in affected areas.\n\n# Impact\n\nThe winter storm had a significant impact on North America, causing widespread disruptions to critical infrastructure, transportation, and daily life.\n\n## Deaths\n\nAt least 90 people died as a direct result of the storm, with many more deaths attributed to related causes such as hypothermia and accidents. The majority of fatalities occurred in the United States, where the storm was particularly severe.\n\n## Infrastructure\n\nThe storm caused significant damage to critical infrastructure, including power grids, transportation systems, and buildings.\n\n### Flight delays and cancellations\n\nOver 10,000 flights were cancelled or delayed due to the storm, leaving thousands of passengers stranded. Many airports closed temporarily, and some remained shut down for several days.\n\n### Road closures and crashes\n\nNumerous roads and highways were closed due to heavy snowfall and freezing rain, causing widespread disruptions to transportation. Many crashes occurred on icy roads, resulting in injuries and fatalities.\n\n### Intra-city transit disruptions\n\nPublic transportation systems in many cities were severely disrupted, with buses and trains suspended or operating on reduced schedules. Some cities implemented emergency transit plans, using alternative modes of transportation to help stranded passengers.\n\n### Inter-city train delays and cancellations\n\nInter-city train service was significantly disrupted, with many trains cancelled or delayed due to the storm. Amtrak, the US national passenger railroad, suspended service on several routes, stranding thousands of passengers.\n\n### Energy emergencies\n\nThe storm caused widespread power outages, with over 1 million households losing electricity. Utility companies declared energy emergencies, activating emergency response plans to restore power as quickly as possible.\n\n### Power outages\n\nPower outages affected many areas, with some communities left without electricity for several days. The outages were caused by a combination of heavy snowfall, freezing rain, and strong winds, which damaged power lines and equipment.\n\n## Sports\n\nThe storm forced the cancellation or postponement of numerous sporting events, including professional and collegiate games. Some teams were stranded on the road, unable to travel due to the weather conditions.\n\n## Corporate and institutional closures\n\nMany businesses and institutions closed temporarily due to the storm, including government offices, schools, and universities. Some companies implemented remote work arrangements, allowing employees to work from home.\n\n## Animals\n\nThe storm had a significant impact on animals, particularly those in outdoor shelters or living in areas affected by power outages. Many animal shelters and rescue organizations reported an increase in intakes, as pets were abandoned or lost during the storm.\n\n# Post-storm cold wave\n\nFollowing the winter storm, a severe cold wave affected much of North America, causing temperatures to plummet to record lows.\n\n## Rocky Mountain region\n\nThe Rocky Mountain region experienced extremely cold temperatures, with some areas recording temperatures below -20°F (-29°C). The cold wave caused widespread disruptions to daily life, with many schools and businesses closing.\n\n## Central United States\n\nThe Central United States experienced significant cold temperatures, with some areas recording temperatures below 0°F (-18°C). The cold wave caused disruptions to transportation and daily life.\n\n## Eastern United States\n\nThe Eastern United States experienced cold temperatures, with some areas recording temperatures below 10°F (-12°C). The cold wave caused disruptions to daily life, with many schools and businesses closing.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of North American winter storms\n* Winter storm\n* Blizzard\n* Ice storm\n* Freezing rain\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a general overview of the December 2022 North American winter storm.

Founded in 1983, the bank catered to the financial needs of technology and life science companies, providing a range of services including banking, lending, and investment management. SVB was one of the largest banks in the United States, with over $200 billion in assets, before its collapse in 2023.\n\n# Foundation and early growth\n\nSilicon Valley Bank was founded in 1983 by Bill Biggerstaff, Roger Dunbar, and Joseph Medici. The bank's early success was largely due to its focus on serving the financial needs of the burgeoning technology industry in Silicon Valley. SVB's founders recognized the unique challenges faced by technology startups, including the need for flexible financing and specialized banking services.\n\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, SVB experienced rapid growth, expanding its operations to serve clients throughout the United States and internationally. The bank established a strong reputation for its expertise in technology and life sciences, and its ability to provide innovative financial solutions to its clients.\n\n# Expansion\n\nIn the 2000s, SVB continued to expand its operations, both organically and through acquisitions. The bank opened new offices in major technology hubs, including New York City, Boston, and London. SVB also expanded its service offerings, introducing new products and services such as investment management and private banking.\n\nIn 2012, SVB acquired SVB Financial Group, a holding company that owned several financial institutions, including SVB Capital, a venture capital and private equity firm. The acquisition expanded SVB's capabilities in investment management and provided access to new clients and markets.\n\n# Operations in lead-up to collapse\n\nIn the years leading up to its collapse, SVB operated as a commercial bank, providing a range of financial services to its clients.\n\n## Business model\n\nSVB's business model was focused on serving the financial needs of technology and life science companies. The bank provided a range of services, including:\n\n* Banking: SVB offered traditional banking services, including deposit accounts, credit cards, and loans.\n* Lending: The bank provided a range of lending products, including venture debt, term loans, and lines of credit.\n* Investment management: SVB offered investment management services, including venture capital and private equity investments.\n* Private banking: The bank provided private banking services, including wealth management and trust services.\n\n## Facilities\n\nSVB operated a network of offices and branches throughout the United States and internationally. The bank's headquarters was located in Santa Clara, California, and it had major offices in New York City, Boston, and London.\n\n## Affiliations and community involvement\n\nSVB was actively involved in the technology and life sciences communities, sponsoring numerous conferences and events. The bank also partnered with several organizations, including the National Venture Capital Association and the Biotechnology Innovation Organization.\n\n# Collapse\n\nOn March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank was placed into receivership by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), following a bank run that left the bank insolvent. The collapse of SVB was the largest bank failure in the United States since the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nThe collapse of SVB was attributed to a combination of factors, including the bank's heavy exposure to technology and life sciences companies, which were particularly vulnerable to economic downturns. The bank's business model, which relied heavily on venture debt and other forms of lending to startups, was also criticized for being too risky.\n\nThe collapse of SVB sent shockwaves through the financial markets, with many technology and life sciences companies facing uncertainty about their financial futures. The FDIC took control of the bank's assets and began the process of winding down its operations.\n\n# References\n\n## Works cited\n\n*Note: This section is intentionally left blank as per the requirements*\n\n# Further reading\n\n*Note: This section is intentionally left blank as per the requirements*\n\n# External links\n\n*Note: This section is intentionally left blank as per the requirements*", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Silicon_Valley_Bank\" following this outline:\n\n#Foundation and early growth\n#Expansion\n#Operations in lead-up to collapse\n##Business model\n##Facilities\n##Affiliations and community involvement\n#Collapse\n#References\n##Works cited\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Roman physicians and surgeons were heavily influenced by Greek medical traditions, and they made significant contributions to the development of surgical techniques and tools. This article provides an overview of the history, tools, and techniques of surgery in ancient Rome.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\nSurgery in ancient Rome has its roots in Greek medicine, which was introduced to Rome during the 3rd century BCE. Greek physicians such as Hippocrates and Galen made significant contributions to the field of surgery, and their works were widely studied and respected by Roman physicians. The Romans also borrowed from other medical traditions, including Egyptian and Babylonian practices.\n\nDuring the Roman Republic (509-27 BCE), surgery was primarily performed by physicians who were trained in Greek medical schools. These physicians were often slaves or freedmen who had been trained in the medical arts. As the Roman Empire expanded, surgery became more widespread, and Roman physicians began to make significant contributions to the field.\n\nOne of the most famous Roman physicians was Galen, who lived during the 2nd century CE. Galen was a prolific writer and made significant contributions to the field of surgery, including the development of new techniques and tools. His works were widely studied and respected for centuries, and he is considered one of the most important physicians in Roman history.\n\nTools\n-----\n\nRoman surgeons used a wide range of tools, many of which were made from bronze, copper, or iron. These tools were often decorated with intricate designs and were made with great care and attention to detail.\n\n### Cupping vessels\n\nCupping vessels were used to create suction on the skin, which was believed to help draw out", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Surgery_in_ancient_Rome\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n#Tools\n##Cupping vessels\n##Chisels and raspatories\n##Drills and levers\n##Saws and trephines\n##Forceps\n##Probes and curettes\n##Scalpels\n##Specula\n##Spoon of Diocles\n##Catheters\n##Strigils\n##Knives and needles\n##Hooks\n##Other tools\n#Techniques\n##Abortion\n##Amputations and dissections\n##Bloodletting\n##Caesarean section\n##Cataract surgery\n##Cosmetic surgery\n##Hernia treatment\n##Lithotomy\n##Neurosurgery\n##Sutures, ligatures, and contractions\n##Tonsillectomies and mastectomies\n##Tooth extraction\n##Other techniques\n#References\n##Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The team played several friendlies against neighboring countries, including India, Turkey, and Afghanistan. Iran's first major international competition was the 1964 Summer Olympics, where they were eliminated in the group stage.\n\n## After the Iranian Revolution\n\nFollowing the Iranian Revolution in 1979, the country's football team was disbanded, and many of its players were forced to flee the country. The team was re-established in the early 1980s, and Iran began to participate in international competitions once again. In 1984, Iran qualified for its first Asian Cup, where they finished third.\n\n## 1998–2006\n\nIran's most successful period in international football came in the late 1990s and early 2000s, under the management of Jalal Talebi and later, Branko Ivanković. The team qualified for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, where they lost to Germany and the United States, but drew with Yugoslavia. Iran also finished third at the 2004 Asian Cup, where they lost to China in the semifinals.\n\n## Temporary suspension\n\nIn 2006, Iran was temporarily suspended from international football by FIFA due to government interference in the country's football federation. The suspension was lifted after the Iranian government agreed to allow the federation to operate independently.\n\n## 2007–14\n\nIran qualified for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, where they lost to Brazil and Portugal, but drew with North Korea. The team also finished third at the 2011 Asian Cup, where they lost to South Korea in the semifinals.\n\n## Late 2010s\n\nIn 2017, Iran qualified for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, where they lost to Spain and Portugal, but drew with Morocco. The team also finished third at the 2019 Asian Cup, where they lost to Japan in the semifinals.\n\n## Early 2020s\n\nIran qualified for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, where they lost to England and the United States, but drew with Wales.\n\n# Team image\n\n## Nicknames\n\nThe Iran national football team is nicknamed Team Melli, which means \"National Team\" in Persian.\n\n## Kits and crests\n\n### Kit suppliers\n\nIran's kit supplier is currently Adidas.\n\n## Sponsorship\n\nIran's main sponsor is currently Irancell.\n\n## Rivalries\n\nIran has rivalries with neighboring countries, including Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.\n\n## Stadiums\n\nIran's home stadium is the Azadi Stadium in Tehran, which has a capacity of over 100,000 spectators.\n\n# Results and fixtures\n\n##

These communities were established through colonization, trade, and cultural exchange, and played a significant role in shaping the cultural, economic, and social landscape of the African continent.\n\nAncient Egypt\n-------------\n\nEgypt was one of the earliest and most significant centers of Greek presence in Africa. The Greeks were attracted to Egypt's rich resources, strategic location, and cultural achievements, and established a number of colonies and settlements along the Nile River.\n\n### First historical colonies\n\nThe first Greek colonies in Egypt were established during the 7th century BC, when Greek traders and mercenaries began to arrive in the country. These early colonies were primarily located in the Nile Delta region, where the Greeks established a number of trading posts and settlements. One of the most famous of these early colonies was the city of Naucratis, which was established around 610 BC and became a major center of Greek trade and culture in Egypt.\n\n### Hellenistic times\n\nDuring the Hellenistic period, which began in the 4th century BC, Greek influence in Egypt increased significantly. The conquests of Alexander the Great in the 4th century BC brought Egypt under Greek rule, and the Ptolemaic dynasty, which was established by one of Alexander's generals, ruled the country for over 300 years.\n\n#### Rule of Alexander the Great (332–323 BC)\n\nAlexander the Great's conquest of Egypt in 332 BC marked the beginning of a new era of Greek rule in the country. Alexander was welcomed as a liberator by the Egyptians, who were dissatisfied with the rule of the Persian Empire. During his short reign, Alexander established a number of Greek cities in Egypt, including the city of Alexandria, which would become one of the greatest cities of the ancient world.\n\n#### The Ptolemaic Empire (323–30 BC)\n\nAfter Alexander's death, his general Ptolemy I Soter established the Ptolemaic dynasty, which ruled Egypt for over 300 years. During this period, Greek culture and language became dominant in Egypt, and the country became a major center of Greek learning and culture. The Ptolemies also established a number of Greek cities in Egypt, including the city of Ptolemais, which became a major center of Greek culture and trade.\n\n### Roman and Byzantine Egypt\n\nDuring the Roman and Byzantine periods, which began in the 1st century BC and lasted until the Arab conquest of Egypt in the 7th century AD, Greek culture and language continued to dominate in Egypt. The Romans and Byzantines maintained the Greek cities and institutions established by the Ptolemies, and Egypt remained a major center of Greek learning and culture.\n\n#### Coptic Greeks\n\nDuring the Byzantine period, a number of Greeks converted to Christianity and became known as Coptic Greeks. The Coptic Greeks played a significant role in the development of Christianity in Egypt, and their language, Coptic, became the liturgical language of the Coptic Orthodox Church.\n\nAncient Ethiopia\n-----------------\n\nEthiopia was another region in Africa where Greek communities were established. The Axumites, who ruled Ethiopia from the 1st to the 7th centuries AD, had significant cultural and trade exchanges with the Greeks.\n\n### Axumites of Ethiopia\n\nThe Axumites were a Semitic-speaking people who established a powerful kingdom in Ethiopia during the 1st century AD. They had significant cultural and trade exchanges with the Greeks, and their capital city, Axum, became a major center of Greek culture and trade in Africa.\n\n### Abyssinian Greeks\n\nDuring the medieval period, a number of Greeks settled in Ethiopia, particularly in the region of Abyssinia. These Greeks played a significant role in the development of Ethiopian culture and learning, and their influence can still be seen in the art, architecture, and literature of Ethiopia.\n\nAncient Libya\n-------------\n\nLibya was another region in Africa where Greek communities were established. The Libyans, who lived in the region of Cyrenaica, had significant cultural and trade exchanges with the Greeks.\n\n### Libyan Greeks of Cyrenaica\n\nThe Libyans of Cyrenaica were a Greek-speaking people who established a number of cities and settlements in the region. They had significant cultural and trade exchanges with the Greeks, and their cities, such as Cyrene and Benghazi, became major centers of Greek culture and trade.\n\n### Libyan Greek culture\n\nThe Libyans of Cyrenaica developed a unique culture that was influenced by both Greek and African traditions. Their art, architecture, and literature reflect the blending of these two cultures, and their legacy can still be seen in the modern-day culture of Libya.\n\nAncient Nubia\n-------------\n\nNubia, which is located in the region of modern-day Sudan, was another region in Africa where Greek communities were established. The Nubians, who lived in the region of the Nile River, had significant cultural and trade exchanges with the Greeks.\n\n### Axumite subjugation of Nubia\n\nDuring the 3rd century AD, the Axumites conquered Nubia and established a number of Greek cities and settlements in the region. The Axumites brought Greek culture and language to Nubia, and the region became a major center of Greek learning and culture.\n\n### Nubian Greeks\n\nDuring the medieval period, a number of Greeks settled in Nubia, particularly in the region of the Nile River. These Greeks played a significant role in the development of Nubian culture and learning, and their influence can still be seen in the art, architecture, and literature of Nubia.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"African_Greeks\" following this outline:\n\n#Ancient Egypt\n##First historical colonies\n##Hellenistic times\n###Rule of Alexander the Great (332–323 BC)\n###The Ptolemaic Empire (323–30 BC)\n##Roman and Byzantine Egypt\n###Coptic Greeks\n#Ancient Ethiopia\n##Axumites of Ethiopia\n##Abyssinian Greeks\n#Ancient Libya\n##Libyan Greeks of Cyrenaica\n##Libyan Greek culture\n#Ancient Nubia\n##Axumite subjugation of Nubia\n##Nubian Greeks\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The remains date back to around 3300 BC, during the Early Neolithic period, and have provided significant insights into the lives of early European farmers.\n\n# Discovery\n\nThe Luttra Woman was discovered in 1943 by a group of peat cutters who stumbled upon the skeleton while working in the Luttra bog. The remains were found in a remarkably well-preserved state, with much of the skeleton still intact, including the skull, torso, and limbs. The discovery was met with great excitement, and the site was quickly excavated by archaeologists.\n\nThe excavation revealed that the Luttra Woman had been buried in a shallow grave, with the body placed in a flexed position, typical of Neolithic burials. The grave also contained a few artifacts, including a pottery vessel and a flint knife.\n\n# Studies\n\nExtensive studies have been conducted on the Luttra Woman, including radiocarbon dating, osteological analysis, and stable isotope analysis. These studies have provided a wealth of information about the woman's life, diet, and death.\n\nRadiocarbon dating has confirmed that the remains date back to around 3300 BC, during the Early Neolithic period. Osteological analysis has revealed that the woman was around 30-40 years old at the time of her death, and was of average height and build for a woman of her time.\n\nStable isotope analysis has provided insights into the woman's diet, revealing that she ate a diet rich in animal products, including meat and dairy. This is consistent with the idea that early Neolithic farmers in Europe were pastoralists, relying heavily on domesticated animals for food.\n\n## Cause of death\n\nThe cause of the Luttra Woman's death is not known for certain, but several theories have been proposed. One theory is that she died from a severe illness, such as pneumonia or tuberculosis. Another theory is that she died from injuries sustained in an accident, such as a fall.\n\nOsteological analysis has revealed that the woman had several health problems during her life, including arthritis and tooth decay. However, it is not clear whether these health problems contributed to her death.\n\n# Exhibition and reconstruction\n\nThe Luttra Woman is currently on display at the Swedish History Museum in Stockholm, where she is one of the museum's most popular exhibits. The skeleton has been reconstructed to show what the woman may have looked like in life, using a combination of osteological analysis and artistic interpretation.\n\nThe reconstruction shows the woman as a robust and healthy individual, with a round face and long hair. She is dressed in clothing typical of the Neolithic period, including a woolen tunic and a leather apron.\n\n# See also\n\n* Otzi the Iceman\n* Tollund Man\n* Neolithic Europe\n* Ancient Swedish history\n\n# References\n\n## Notes\n\n## Citations\n\n# External links\n\n* Swedish History Museum\n* Luttra Woman on the Swedish History Museum website", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Luttra_Woman\" following this outline:\n\n#Discovery\n#Studies\n##Cause of death\n#Exhibition and reconstruction\n#See also\n#References\n##Notes\n##Citations\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is based on the eponymous fashion dolls by Mattel, and it marks the first live-action Barbie film after numerous computer-animated films and specials. The movie follows the story of Barbie, a perfect doll who is expelled from her ideal world and enters the real world, where she discovers the complexities of human life.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe film begins with Barbie (Margot Robbie) living in a perfect world called Barbieland, where everything is bright, colorful, and ideal. However, she is soon expelled from this world and enters the real world, where she discovers the complexities of human life. As she navigates this new world, she meets Gloria (America Ferrera), a kind-hearted woman who becomes her guide. Together, they embark on a journey to discover the truth about Barbie's past and her purpose in life.\n\nAlong the way, Barbie meets a diverse group of characters, including Ken (Ryan Gosling), a charming but dim-witted doll who becomes her love interest. As Barbie navigates the real world, she discovers the flaws and imperfections of human life, including racism, sexism, and inequality.

The team will consist of athletes from countries that are currently suspended or have limited participation in the Olympics.\n\nBackground\n\n### Timeline\n\nThe concept of Individual Neutral Athlete was first introduced at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where a team of athletes from Kuwait competed under the Olympic flag due to the country's suspension from the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Since then, the INA team has participated in several Olympic Games, including the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan.\n\n### Controversies\n\nThe participation of Individual Neutral Athletes has been the subject of controversy, with some arguing that it undermines the integrity of the Olympic Games and creates an unfair advantage for athletes who are not subject to the same rules and regulations as other competitors. Others have argued that the INA team provides an opportunity for athletes from countries with limited resources or those who are subject to sanctions to compete at the highest level.\n\n### Media coverage\n\nThe Individual Neutral Athlete team has received significant media attention in recent years, with many outlets highlighting the challenges faced by athletes who are forced to compete without the support of their national Olympic committees.

Federal judges are appointed for life, and their deaths can create vacancies that need to be filled, leading to a range of consequences. This article explores the background, political and logistical consequences, and lists of deaths of United States federal judges in active service.\n\n#Background\n\nFederal judges in the United States are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate for life terms. This means that they serve until they resign, retire, or pass away. The lifetime appointment of federal judges is intended to ensure their independence and impartiality, allowing them to make decisions based on the law without fear of political retribution or pressure.\n\nDespite their lifetime appointments, federal judges are not immune to mortality. When a federal judge dies in active service, it creates a vacancy on the court. This vacancy can have significant consequences, both politically and logistically.\n\n#Political consequences\n\nThe death of a federal judge can have significant political consequences. The President and the Senate must work together to fill the vacancy, which can be a contentious process. The President typically nominates a replacement, who must then be confirmed by the Senate. This process can be influenced by a range of factors, including party politics, ideological differences, and regional interests.\n\nIn some cases, the death of a federal judge can shift the balance of power on a court. For example, if a conservative judge dies and is replaced by a liberal judge, it can change the outcome of future cases. This can have significant implications for the development of the law and the administration of justice.\n\nThe death of a federal judge can also create opportunities for politicians to advance their own interests. For example, a President may use the vacancy to appoint a judge who shares their ideological views or to reward a political ally. Similarly, Senators may use the confirmation process to extract concessions or to promote their own agendas.\n\n#Logistical consequences\n\nThe death of a federal judge can also have significant logistical consequences. When a judge dies, their cases must be reassigned to other judges, which can create a backlog and delay the resolution of cases. This can be particularly problematic in busy courts with heavy caseloads.\n\nThe death of a federal judge can also require the court to adjust its operations. For example, the court may need to reassign staff or adjust its scheduling to accommodate the loss of a judge. In some cases, the court may need to seek assistance from other courts or judges to help manage its workload.\n\nIn addition, the death of a federal judge can create administrative challenges. For example, the court may need to manage the deceased judge's chambers and staff, which can be a complex and time-consuming process.\n\n#Lists\n\n##1789–1869\n\n* John Blair (1796–1799)\n* William Paterson (1793–1806)\n* Oliver Ellsworth (1796–1800)\n* Bushrod Washington (1799–1829)\n* Alfred B.

The protests were sparked by the country's worst economic crisis since its independence in 1948, which led to widespread shortages of food, fuel, and other essential goods.\n\n# Background\n\nSri Lanka has been facing a severe economic crisis since 2021, which was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The country's foreign exchange reserves had dwindled to a record low, and it was struggling to pay its debts. The government's decision to ban the importation of chemical fertilizers in 2021, in an effort to promote organic farming, had also led to a significant decline in agricultural production. As a result, the prices of essential goods had skyrocketed, and many Sri Lankans were struggling to make ends meet.\n\n# Timeline\n\n## March\n\nThe protests began in March 2022, with small-scale demonstrations taking place in various parts of the country. The protesters were demanding the resignation of President Rajapaksa and his government, which they held responsible for the economic crisis.\n\n## April\n\n### Declaration of state of emergency\n\nOn April 1, 2022, President Rajapaksa declared a state of emergency in the country, giving the military sweeping powers to quell the protests. The move was widely criticized by opposition parties and civil society groups, who accused the government of trying to silence dissent.\n\n### Social media blocks\n\nOn April 3, 2022, the government blocked access to social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, in an effort to prevent the spread of \"false information\" about the protests. The move was widely condemned by human rights groups, who accused the government of trying to stifle free speech.\n\n### Cabinet resignation\n\nOn April 3, 2022, the entire cabinet resigned, except for four ministers, in an effort to appease the protesters. However, the move was seen as too little, too late, and the protests continued unabated.\n\n### Reconvening of Parliament\n\nOn April 4, 2022, Parliament reconvened after a brief adjournment, and opposition parties tabled a motion of no-confidence against the government. However, the motion was defeated due to the ruling party's majority in Parliament.\n\n### \"Occupy Galle Face\"\n\nOn April 9, 2022, a group of protesters began an \"Occupy Galle Face\" campaign, setting up a tent city in front of the Presidential Secretariat in Colombo. The campaign was inspired by the \"Occupy Wall Street\" movement in the United States.\n\n### Mynagogama\n\nOn April 12, 2022, a group of protesters clashed with the police in Mynagogama, a suburb of Colombo. The police used tear gas and water cannons to disperse the protesters, and several people were injured.\n\n### 19 April: Rambukkana incident\n\nOn April 19, 2022, a group of protesters clashed with the police in Rambukkana, a town in the central highlands. The police fired live ammunition at the protesters, killing one person and injuring several others.\n\n### 28 April: Island-wide token strike\n\nOn April 28, 2022, an island-wide token strike was observed, with many businesses and schools closed in support of the protests.\n\n## May\n\n### HoruGoGama protests\n\nOn May 1, 2022, a group of protesters set up a protest camp in HoruGoGama, a suburb of Colombo. The camp was inspired by the \"Occupy Galle Face\" campaign and was seen as a symbol of resistance against the government.\n\n### Black Monday attacks on protesters\n\nOn May 9, 2022, a group of government supporters attacked protesters in Colombo, injuring several people. The incident was widely condemned by opposition parties and civil society groups.\n\n### Resignation of Mahinda Rajapaksa\n\nOn May 9, 2022, Mahinda Rajapaksa, the Prime Minister and President Rajapaksa's brother, resigned from his post. The move was seen as a concession to the protesters, but it did little to appease them.\n\n### Deployment of military\n\nOn May 10, 2022, the military was deployed to quell the protests, with troops patrolling the streets of Colombo and other cities. The move was widely criticized by opposition parties and civil society groups.\n\n### Founding of No-Deal-Gama\n\nOn May 15, 2022, a group of protesters set up a protest camp in No-Deal-Gama, a suburb of Colombo. The camp was seen as a symbol of resistance against the government and was inspired by the \"Occupy Galle Face\" campaign.\n\n## June\n\nThe protests continued throughout June, with small-scale demonstrations taking place in various parts of the country.\n\n## July\n\n### 9 July: Storming of President's House\n\nOn July 9, 2022, a group of protesters stormed the President's House in Colombo, forcing President Rajapaksa to flee. The incident was widely reported in the media and marked a turning point in the protests.\n\n### 13 July: Appointment of Acting President\n\nOn July 13, 2022, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was appointed as the Acting President of Sri Lanka, following the resignation of President Rajapaksa.\n\n### 14–15 July: President Rajapaksa's resignation\n\nOn July 14-15, 2022, President Rajapaksa resigned from his post, marking the end of his presidency.\n\n### 20–22 July: Under the new President, Galle Face raid\n\nOn July 20-22, 2022, the military raided the Galle Face protest camp, arresting several protesters and demolishing the camp. The incident was widely condemned by opposition parties and civil society groups.\n\n## August\n\nThe protests continued throughout August, with small-scale demonstrations taking place in various parts of the country.\n\n## September\n\nThe protests continued throughout September, with small-scale demonstrations taking place in various parts of the country.\n\n## November\n\nThe protests continued throughout November, with small-scale demonstrations taking place in various parts of the country.\n\n# International protests\n\nThe 2022 Sri Lankan protests also sparked international protests, with demonstrations taking place in several countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## New government\n\nThe new government, led by President Wickremesinghe, has promised to address the economic crisis and implement reforms to prevent similar crises in the future.\n\n## Opposition\n\nThe opposition parties have continued to demand the resignation of the government and the establishment of an interim administration to oversee the transition to a new government.\n\n## International\n\nThe international community has expressed concern over the situation in Sri Lanka and has called for calm and restraint. The United Nations has offered assistance to the government to address the economic crisis.\n\n# Departures to foreign states\n\nSeveral members of the Rajapaksa family, including Mahinda Rajapaksa and his son Namal Rajapaksa, have fled the country, sparking speculation about their future plans.\n\n# See also\n\n* Sri Lankan economic crisis\n* 2019 Sri Lankan presidential election\n* 2020 Sri Lankan parliamentary election\n\n# Footnotes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Sri_Lankan_protests\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Timeline\n##March\n##April\n###Declaration of state of emergency\n###Social media blocks\n###Cabinet resignation\n###Reconvening of Parliament\n###\"Occupy Galle Face\"\n###Mynagogama\n###19 April: Rambukkana incident\n###28 April: Island-wide token strike\n##May\n###HoruGoGama protests\n###Black Monday attacks on protesters\n###Resignation of Mahinda Rajapaksa\n###Deployment of military\n###Founding of No-Deal-Gama\n##June\n##July\n###9 July: Storming of President's House\n###13 July: Appointment of Acting President\n###14–15 July: President Rajapaksa's resignation\n###20–22 July: Under the new President, Galle Face raid\n##August\n##September\n##November\n#International protests\n#Reactions\n##New government\n##Opposition\n##International\n#Departures to foreign states\n#See also\n#Footnotes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

She was known for her fearless reporting from the front lines of conflict zones, particularly in the Middle East. Abu Akleh's reporting career was marked by her dedication to telling the stories of those affected by war and her commitment to shedding light on the struggles of the Palestinian people.\n\n#Early life and education\n\nShireen Abu Akleh was born on April 3, 1971, in Jerusalem to a Palestinian Christian family. She grew up in the neighborhood of Beit Hanina, where she developed a strong sense of connection to her Palestinian heritage. Abu Akleh's family moved to the United States when she was a teenager, and she spent several years living in New Jersey. She later returned to the Middle East to pursue a career in journalism.\n\nAbu Akleh earned a bachelor's degree in English literature from the Jordan University of Science and Technology and a master's degree in English literature from Yarmouk University in Jordan. She began her journalism career in the late 1990s, working as a reporter for various news outlets in the Middle East.\n\n#Career\n\nAbu Akleh joined Al Jazeera in 1997, shortly after the network's launch. She quickly established herself as a talented and fearless reporter, known for her ability to navigate the complexities of conflict zones. Over the course of her career, Abu Akleh reported from numerous hotspots, including Iraq, Afghanistan, and the Gaza Strip.\n\nAbu Akleh's reporting often focused on the human impact of conflict, and she was particularly known for her coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. She reported on numerous incidents of violence and unrest in the region, including the Second Intifada and the Israeli military's Operation Cast Lead in Gaza.\n\nAbu Akleh's work was widely respected, and she received numerous awards and accolades for her reporting.

She was 51 years old at the time of her death. According to eyewitnesses, Abu Akleh was shot in the head by Israeli forces while attempting to flee the scene of the operation. She was wearing a press vest and helmet at the time of her death.\n\n##Aftermath\n\nAbu Akleh's death sparked widespread outrage and condemnation, with many calling for an investigation into the circumstances surrounding her killing.

The United Nations, the European Union, and numerous human rights organizations all issued statements calling for an investigation into the circumstances surrounding her killing.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority also issued a statement condemning Abu Akleh's death, and calling for international action to hold Israel accountable for its actions. The Israeli government, on the other hand, was criticized for its handling of the incident, with many accusing it of attempting to cover up the circumstances surrounding Abu Akleh's death.\n\n#Investigations\n\n##Initial Israel investigations\n\nThe Israeli military initially announced that it would conduct an investigation into Abu Akleh's death, but later stated that it would not launch a formal investigation into the incident. This decision was widely criticized, with many accusing the Israeli government of attempting to cover up the circumstances surrounding Abu Akleh's death.\n\n##Subsequent investigations\n\nIn the days following Abu Akleh's death, numerous human rights organizations and media outlets launched their own investigations into the incident. These investigations found that Abu Akleh had been shot by Israeli forces, and that there was no evidence to suggest that she had been caught in the crossfire between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants.\n\n##Announcement of US investigation\n\nOn May 24, 2022, the United States announced that it would conduct its own investigation into Abu Akleh's death. The investigation was led by the US Department of State, and was intended to determine the circumstances surrounding Abu Akleh's death.\n\n##Referral of case to the International Criminal Court\n\nIn June 2022, the International Criminal Court announced that it would investigate Abu Akleh's death, along with other alleged war crimes committed by Israeli forces in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The investigation was launched at the request of the Palestinian Authority, which had referred the case to the court in May 2022.\n\n#Remembrance and legacy\n\nShireen Abu Akleh's death was met with widespread tributes and condolences from around the world. She was remembered as a fearless and dedicated journalist, who had spent her career shedding light on the struggles of the Palestinian people.\n\nAbu Akleh's legacy continues to inspire journalists and human rights activists around the world.

(2017). The album's title was first teased in August 2021, when Lamar updated his website with a message that read, \"The next and final TDE album from Kendrick Lamar.\" This sparked speculation among fans and media outlets about the meaning behind the title and the album's content.\n\nIn the months leading up to the album's release, Lamar made sporadic appearances and dropped subtle hints about the project. In September 2021, he performed a surprise set at the Day N Vegas festival, where he debuted several new songs that would later appear on the album. He also made a guest appearance on the song \"Family Ties\" by Baby Keem, which was released in August 2021 and featured a verse from Lamar.\n\n# Recording\n\nRecording for Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers took place over the course of several years, with Lamar working on the album in various studios around the world. In an interview with Apple Music, Lamar revealed that he had been working on the album since 2019, but that the process was slow due to his own perfectionism.\n\nLamar worked with a range of producers on the album, including Sounwave, J. Lbs, and Boi-1da. He also collaborated with several guest artists, including Summer Walker, Ghostemane, and Blxst. The album's sound is characterized by its use of jazz and funk samples, as well as its introspective and personal lyrics.\n\n# Music and lyrical themes\n\n## Composition\n\nMusically, Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers is a diverse and experimental album that incorporates a range of styles and genres. The album's sound is characterized by its use of jazz and funk samples, as well as its incorporation of live instrumentation. Lamar has said that he was inspired by the music of jazz legends such as John Coltrane and Thelonious Monk, and that he sought to capture the same sense of spontaneity and creativity on the album.\n\n## Themes\n\nLyrically, Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers is a deeply personal and introspective album that explores themes of identity, relationships, and social justice. Lamar has said that the album is a reflection of his own personal growth and development, and that he sought to explore themes that were relevant to his own life and experiences.\n\nOne of the central themes of the album is the concept of masculinity and what it means to be a man. Lamar explores this theme in songs such as \"N95\" and \"Savior\", where he critiques traditional notions of masculinity and offers a more nuanced and complex understanding of what it means to be a man.\n\n## Songs\n\nThe album's tracklist is divided into two distinct sections, each with its own unique sound and themes. The first section is characterized by its use of jazz and funk samples, as well as its introspective and personal lyrics. Songs such as \"United in Grief\" and \"Worldwide Steppers\" showcase Lamar's storytelling ability and offer a glimpse into his own personal experiences and emotions.\n\nThe second section of the album is more experimental and avant-garde, featuring songs such as \"Die Hard\" and \"Savior\". These songs showcase Lamar's ability to push the boundaries of hip-hop and create something new and innovative.\n\n# Release and promotion\n\n## Live performances\n\nIn the months leading up to the album's release, Lamar performed at several live events and festivals, including the Day N Vegas festival and the Rolling Loud festival. He also made a surprise appearance at the Super Bowl LVI halftime show, where he performed a medley of his hits.\n\n## Singles\n\nThe album's first single, \"N95\", was released in April 2022 and debuted at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. The song's music video was also released, and it features Lamar rapping and singing in a series of surreal and abstract settings.\n\n## Tour\n\nIn May 2022, Lamar announced the Big Steppers Tour, which kicked off in June 2022 and features stops in North America, Europe, and Australia. The tour features special guests such as Baby Keem and Tanna Leone, and it showcases Lamar's ability to create a dynamic and engaging live show.\n\n# Critical reception\n\nMr. Morale & the Big Steppers received widespread critical acclaim upon its release. Reviewers praised the album's innovative production, introspective lyrics, and Lamar's storytelling ability.\n\n## Year-end lists\n\nThe album appeared on several year-end lists, including those published by Rolling Stone, Pitchfork, and Complex. It was also named one of the best albums of 2022 by several critics, including those at The New York Times and The Guardian.\n\n# Industry awards\n\nMr. Morale & the Big Steppers was nominated for several industry awards, including the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. It also won the BET Award for Album of the Year and the BET Hip Hop Award for Album of the Year.\n\n# Commercial performance\n\nThe album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart, with over 295,000 equivalent album units earned in its first week. It also debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart and the Australian Albums Chart.\n\n# Track listing\n\n1. \"United in Grief\"\n2. \"N95\"\n3. \"Worldwide Steppers\"\n4. \"Die Hard\"\n5. \"Savior\"\n6. \"Auntie Diaries\"\n7. \"Mr. Morale\"\n8. \"Mother I Sober\"\n9. \"Mirror\"\n10. \"The Heart Part 5\"\n11. \"The Heart Part 6\"\n12. \"Savior (Reprise)\"\n13. \"Die Hard (Reprise)\"\n14. \"Count Me Out\"\n15. \"Crown\"\n16. \"Purple Hearts\"\n17. \"Tammy's Song (Her Evils)\"\n18. \"Father Time\"\n19. \"Father Time (Reprise)\"\n\n# Personnel\n\n* Kendrick Lamar - vocals, production\n* Sounwave - production\n* J.

The project allows users to create and modify a large, shared canvas by placing colored pixels on a grid. The experiment has been conducted three times, in 2017, 2022, and 2023, each with its own unique characteristics and outcomes.\n\nOverview\n--------\n\nR/place is a crowdsourced artwork that is created and modified by Reddit users in real-time. The project is hosted on a dedicated subreddit, r/place, where users can submit and vote on changes to the canvas. The canvas is divided into a grid of pixels, each of which can be colored in one of 16 available colors. Users can place a single pixel on the canvas every 5 minutes, with the option to choose from a palette of colors.\n\nThe project's simplicity and collaborative nature have made it a fascinating case study in online behavior, social dynamics, and the power of crowdsourcing. R/place has been described as a \"digital canvas\" and a \"social experiment\" that allows users to \"create and destroy\" art in real-time.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### 2017 Experiment\n\nThe first R/place experiment was conducted in 2017, on April 1st, and lasted for 72 hours. The experiment was created by Reddit's administrators as an April Fools' Day prank, but it quickly took on a life of its own. The initial canvas was a 1000x1000 pixel grid, and users could place a single pixel every 5 minutes.\n\nThe 2017 experiment was marked by a series of \"wars\" between different groups of users, each trying to claim territory on the canvas and impose their own designs. The most notable conflict was between users from the subreddit r/dankmemes, who created a giant image of a meme character, and users from the subreddit r/ pol, who attempted to delete the image and replace it with their own content.\n\nDespite the conflicts, the 2017 experiment resulted in a surprisingly cohesive and intricate artwork, with many users collaborating to create complex designs and patterns. The experiment was widely covered in the media, with many outlets praising its creativity and unpredictability.\n\n### 2022 Experiment\n\nThe second R/place experiment was conducted in 2022, on April 1st, and lasted for 4 days. The experiment was expanded to a 2000x2000 pixel grid, and users could place a single pixel every 5 minutes.\n\nThe 2022 experiment was marked by a greater emphasis on collaboration and community-building. Many users worked together to create large-scale artworks, including a giant image of the Reddit alien logo and a sprawling cityscape. The experiment also saw the emergence of \"pixel artists,\" users who specialized in creating intricate designs and patterns using the limited palette of colors.\n\nThe 2022 experiment was also notable for its increased focus on inclusivity and diversity. Many users worked to create artworks that celebrated different cultures, identities, and communities, and the experiment saw a significant increase in participation from users from outside the United States.\n\n### 2023 Experiment\n\nThe third R/place experiment was conducted in 2023, on April 1st, and lasted for 5 days. The experiment was expanded to a 3000x3000 pixel grid, and users could place a single pixel every 5 minutes.\n\nThe 2023 experiment saw a significant increase in participation, with over 10 million users contributing to the canvas. The experiment was marked by a greater emphasis on complexity and detail, with many users working to create intricate designs and patterns.\n\nThe 2023 experiment also saw the emergence of new technologies and tools, including AI-powered pixel art generators and collaborative editing software. These tools allowed users to create more complex and detailed artworks, and to collaborate more easily with others.\n\nMedia Response\n-------------\n\nR/place has received widespread media coverage, with many outlets praising its creativity, unpredictability, and community-driven approach. The experiment has been featured in publications such as The New York Times, The Guardian, and Wired, and has been the subject of numerous documentaries and videos.\n\nAtlas\n------\n\nThe R/place Atlas is a comprehensive guide to the experiment's history, artwork, and community. The atlas was created by a team of volunteer editors and researchers, and features detailed maps, timelines, and analysis of the experiment's outcomes.\n\nThe atlas is divided into three main sections: the 2017 Atlas, the 2022 Atlas, and the 2023 Atlas. Each section features a detailed map of the canvas, as well as analysis of the artwork, community, and technologies used during the experiment.\n\nSee Also\n--------\n\n* Crowdsourcing\n* Collaborative art\n* Social media\n* Online communities\n* Pixel art\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n(No references are included in this article)\n\nExternal Links\n---------------\n\n* R/place subreddit\n* R/place Atlas\n* Reddit's official blog post on R/place", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"R/place\" following this outline:\n\n#Overview\n#History\n##2017 experiment\n##2022 experiment\n##2023 experiment\n#Media response\n#Atlas\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The film is based on the DC Comics character of the same name and is a reboot of the Batman film franchise. The movie follows the story of Bruce Wayne, a.k.a. Batman, as he investigates a series of murders committed by the Riddler, a serial killer who targets the corrupt and wealthy elite of Gotham City.\n\nPlot\n-----\n\nThe film takes place two years after Bruce Wayne (Robert Pattinson) has become the vigilante Batman. He is still struggling to come to terms with the death of his parents and is obsessed with finding justice for the people of Gotham City. The story begins with the murder of the Gotham City Mayor, Don Mitchell Jr. (Rupert Penry-Jones), who is found dead in his mansion with a cryptic message left behind by the killer.\n\nAs Batman delves deeper into the case, he realizes that the murder is linked to a series of other killings, all of which have been committed by the Riddler (Paul Dano), a serial killer who uses his cleverness and intelligence to outsmart his victims and the police. The Riddler's modus operandi is to leave behind a series of clues and puzzles, which he believes will lead Batman to the truth about the corrupt and decadent society of Gotham City.\n\nAs Batman investigates the case, he is aided by his allies, including his butler Alfred Pennyworth (Andy Serkis), Commissioner James Gordon (Jeffrey Wright), and Selina Kyle (Zoë Kravitz), a cat burglar who becomes embroiled in the case. Together, they uncover a web of corruption and deceit that goes all the way to the top of Gotham City's power structure.\n\nCast\n-----\n\n* Robert Pattinson as Bruce Wayne / Batman\n* Paul Dano as Edward Nashton / The Riddler\n* Zoë Kravitz as Selina Kyle / Catwoman\n* Jeffrey Wright as James Gordon\n* John Turturro as Carmine Falcone\n* Peter Sarsgaard as Gil Colson\n* Andy Serkis as Alfred Pennyworth\n* Colin Farrell as Oswald Cobblepot / The Penguin\n\nProduction\n------------\n\n### Development\n\n#### Early work and initial plans from Ben Affleck\n\nIn 2014, it was announced that Ben Affleck would star in and direct a new Batman film, which would be part of the DC Extended Universe.

However, in 2017, Affleck dropped out of the project, citing that he wanted to focus on acting.\n\n#### Redevelopment under Matt Reeves\n\nAfter Affleck's departure, the project was redeveloped under the direction of Matt Reeves, who was known for his work on the \"Planet of the Apes\" franchise. Reeves brought a new vision to the project, which would focus on a more grounded and realistic take on the Batman character. The film would also be a standalone story, separate from the DC Extended Universe.\n\n### Writing\n\nThe screenplay for \"The Batman\" was written by Matt Reeves and Peter Craig.

The suit was created by Durran and her team, who worked closely with Pattinson to ensure that it was comfortable and practical to wear.\n\nThe suit was inspired by the comic book series, with a focus on the character's iconic logo and color scheme. However, the design was also influenced by modern armor and tactical gear, with a focus on functionality and mobility.\n\n#### Other costumes\n\nThe costumes for the rest of the cast were designed to reflect their characters' personalities and backgrounds. The Riddler's costume was designed to be a key part of his character's obsessive and meticulous personality, with a focus on detail and precision.\n\nSelina Kyle's costume was designed to reflect her character's cat burglar persona, with a focus on flexibility and mobility. The costume was also designed to be visually striking, with a bold color scheme and distinctive design.\n\n### Filming\n\nPrincipal photography for \"The Batman\" began in January 2020 and lasted for several months. The film was shot on location in the UK and the US, with some studio work in London.\n\n#### Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nThe production was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused a delay in filming. The cast and crew had to follow strict protocols to ensure their safety, including social distancing and mask-wearing.\n\n### Editing\n\nThe film was edited by William Hoy and Tyler Nelson, who worked closely with Reeves to ensure that the film's pacing and tone were consistent with his vision.\n\n### Visual effects\n\nThe visual effects for \"The Batman\" were created by Weta Digital, who worked closely with Reeves to ensure that the film's visual identity was consistent with his vision. The effects were used to enhance the film's action sequences and to create a sense of scale and scope.\n\n### Music\n\nThe score for \"The Batman\" was composed by Michael Giacchino, who worked closely with Reeves to ensure that the music was consistent with his vision. The score was designed to be dark and gritty, with a focus on percussion and electronics.\n\nMarketing\n------------\n\nThe marketing campaign for \"The Batman\" began in August 2020, with the release of a teaser trailer. The trailer was well-received by fans, who were excited to see the film's dark and gritty take on the Batman character.\n\nThe campaign continued over the next few months, with the release of several more trailers and TV spots.
