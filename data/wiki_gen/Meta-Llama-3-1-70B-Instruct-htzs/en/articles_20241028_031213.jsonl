His life was marked by a complex web of espionage, deception, and manipulation, which ultimately led to his involvement with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and his emigration to the United States.\n\nEarly life and Nazi career\n---------------------------\n\n### Early life and business ventures\n\nOtto von Bolschwing was born on October 15, 1909, in Schönfließ, a small town in the province of Brandenburg, Germany. He came from a noble family and was raised in a strict, conservative household. After completing his secondary education, von Bolschwing pursued a career in business, working as a sales representative for a textile company. However, he soon became disillusioned with the monotony of his job and began to look for more exciting opportunities.\n\n### Mandatory Palestine\n\nIn 1933, von Bolschwing traveled to Mandatory Palestine, where he became involved with the German Templers, a group of German colonizers who had settled in the region. During his time in Palestine, von Bolschwing developed strong connections with the local Jewish community, which would later become a valuable asset in his intelligence career.\n\n### Office of Jewish Affairs\n\nUpon his return to Germany, von Bolschwing joined the Nazi Party and began working for the Office of Jewish Affairs, a department responsible for implementing the party's anti-Semitic policies. Von Bolschwing's experience in Palestine and his connections with the Jewish community made him an ideal candidate for this role, as he was able to gather intelligence on Jewish organizations and individuals.\n\nWorld War II\n------------\n\n### Romania\n\nIn 1940, von Bolschwing was assigned to Romania, where he worked as a liaison officer between the German and Romanian governments. His primary responsibility was to gather intelligence on the Romanian Jewish community and to facilitate the implementation of anti-Semitic policies in the country.\n\n### Downfall and imprisonment\n\nHowever, von Bolschwing's career in Romania was short-lived. In 1941, he was accused of being a double agent and was arrested by the Gestapo. He was imprisoned for several months but managed to escape and flee to Austria, where he went into hiding.\n\n### Austria\n\nIn Austria, von Bolschwing assumed a new identity and began working as a businessman. He managed to keep a low profile and avoid detection by the authorities, but his past eventually caught up with him. In 1945, he was arrested by American forces and imprisoned for his involvement with the Nazi Party.\n\nPostwar espionage\n-----------------\n\n### Gehlen Organization\n\nAfter his release from prison, von Bolschwing began working for the Gehlen Organization, a private intelligence agency founded by Reinhard Gehlen, a former German General. The organization was later absorbed into the CIA, and von Bolschwing became a key figure in the development of the agency's Eastern European operations.\n\n### Central Intelligence Agency\n\nIn 1954, von Bolschwing was recruited by the CIA, where he worked as a senior intelligence officer. He played a significant role in the agency's operations in Eastern Europe, using his connections with former Nazi officials to gather intelligence on Soviet activities.\n\n### Cover-up\n\nHowever, von Bolschwing's past soon became a liability for the CIA. In the late 1950s, the agency began to receive allegations that von Bolschwing had been involved in war crimes during his time in Romania. The agency launched an investigation, but von Bolschwing's colleagues and superiors worked to cover up his past, fearing that the scandal would damage the agency's reputation.\n\n### Emigration to the United States\n\nIn 1959, von Bolschwing emigrated to the United States, where he settled in California. He continued to work for the CIA, using his expertise to advise on Eastern European operations.\n\nLife in the United States\n-------------------------\n\n### Business career\n\nIn addition to his work for the CIA, von Bolschwing also pursued a successful business career. He founded a consulting firm and worked as a lobbyist, using his connections with former Nazi officials to secure contracts with the US government.\n\n### TCI scandal\n\nHowever, von Bolschwing's business career was not without controversy. In the 1970s, he became embroiled in a scandal surrounding the Transcontinental Corporation (TCI), a company that had been accused of bribing government officials. Von Bolschwing was accused of being involved in the scandal, but he denied any wrongdoing.\n\n### Later life and investigations\n\nIn the 1980s, von Bolschwing's past finally caught up with him. The US government launched an investigation into his involvement with the Nazi Party, and he was forced to testify before Congress. Von Bolschwing died in 1982, but the controversy surrounding his life and career continued to simmer.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nExternal links\n--------------\n\nBibliography\n------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Otto_von_Bolschwing\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and Nazi career\n##Early life and business ventures\n##Mandatory Palestine\n##Office of Jewish Affairs\n#World War II\n##Romania\n##Downfall and imprisonment\n##Austria\n#Postwar espionage\n##Gehlen Organization\n##Central Intelligence Agency\n##Cover-up\n##Emigration to the United States\n#Life in the United States\n##Business career\n##TCI scandal\n##Later life and investigations\n#References\n#External links\n#Bibliography\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The game was played on February 12, 2023, at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. The Kansas City Chiefs defeated the Philadelphia Eagles by a score of 38-35, capturing their second Super Bowl title in four years.\n\n# Background\n\n## Host selection\n\nIn May 2018, the NFL announced that State Farm Stadium would host Super Bowl LVII. The stadium, located in Glendale, Arizona, had previously hosted Super Bowl XLII and Super Bowl XLIX. The selection was made after a bidding process, with the Arizona Super Bowl Host Committee submitting a successful bid to host the game.\n\n## Calls for location change\n\nIn the months leading up to the game, there were calls to relocate Super Bowl LVII due to concerns about the treatment of Native American communities in Arizona. The state had recently passed laws that critics argued were discriminatory towards Native Americans, leading to a backlash from some NFL fans and sponsors. However, the NFL ultimately decided to keep the game in Arizona, citing a commitment to using the event as a platform for promoting social justice and awareness.\n\n## Indigenous representation\n\nIn response to the criticism, the NFL and the Arizona Super Bowl Host Committee made a concerted effort to incorporate indigenous representation into the game and surrounding events. This included the inclusion of Native American performers and artists in the pre-game and halftime shows, as well as the recognition of Native American veterans during the game.\n\n## Stadium playing surface\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the game, there were concerns about the condition of the playing surface at State Farm Stadium. The stadium's grass field had been replaced with a new surface, but some players and coaches expressed concerns about its quality. However, the NFL and the stadium's management assured that the surface was safe and suitable for play.\n\n# Teams\n\n## Kansas City Chiefs\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs entered Super Bowl LVII as the second seed in the AFC, having finished the regular season with a 14-3 record. Led by quarterback Patrick Mahomes, the Chiefs had a high-powered offense that averaged over 30 points per game. They defeated the Jacksonville Jaguars and the Cincinnati Bengals in the playoffs to advance to the Super Bowl.\n\n## Philadelphia Eagles\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles entered Super Bowl LVII as the first seed in the NFC, having finished the regular season with a 14-3 record. Led by quarterback Jalen Hurts, the Eagles had a strong offense and a stout defense that allowed just 20 points per game. They defeated the New York Giants and the San Francisco 49ers in the playoffs to advance to the Super Bowl.\n\n## Playoffs\n\nThe playoffs leading up to Super Bowl LVII were marked by several exciting games and upsets. The Chiefs came from behind to defeat the Jaguars in the divisional round, while the Eagles dominated the Giants in the divisional round. The Chiefs then defeated the Bengals in the AFC Championship Game, while the Eagles defeated the 49ers in the NFC Championship Game.\n\n## Pre-game notes\n\nIn the days leading up to the game, there were several storylines that dominated the news. The Chiefs were seeking their second Super Bowl title in four years, while the Eagles were seeking their second title in franchise history.

Several major brands, including Pepsi, Bud Light, and Google, ran high-profile ads during the game. The ads were widely discussed and analyzed on social media, with some being praised for their creativity and others being criticized for their lack of impact.\n\n### Ratings\n\nThe broadcast of Super Bowl LVII drew a 43.3 household rating and a 68 share, making it one of the highest-rated television events of the year. The game also drew a 48.8 rating among adults 18-49, making it one of the most-watched events among young adults.\n\n### Streaming\n\nSuper Bowl LVII was also streamed online by various platforms, including Fox Sports, NFL.com, and the NFL app. The game was available to stream for free, with several options for viewing, including a traditional broadcast feed and several alternative streams.\n\n### Radio\n\nSuper Bowl LVII was broadcast on radio by Westwood One.

The inquiry was initiated in 2023, and it has been a highly politicized and contentious issue.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nThe impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden was initiated amidst allegations of misconduct and abuse of power. The allegations centered on Biden's handling of foreign policy, particularly with regards to Ukraine and China. Critics of the President argued that he had used his executive authority to further his own personal interests, rather than the interests of the United States.\n\nAdditionally, Biden's administration had faced criticism for its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, the economy, and social justice issues. Many Republicans had expressed frustration with the President's policies and had called for greater accountability.\n\nInitiation of the Inquiry\n-------------------------\n\nThe impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden was formally initiated in March 2023, when a group of Republican lawmakers introduced a resolution calling for an investigation into the President's conduct. The resolution was referred to the House Judiciary Committee, which began conducting hearings and gathering evidence.\n\nHouse Committee Investigations\n-----------------------------\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee, led by Chairman Jim Jordan, conducted a series of hearings and interviews with witnesses. The committee also issued subpoenas for documents and testimony from various individuals, including administration officials and private citizens.\n\nOne of the key areas of focus for the committee was the President's interactions with foreign leaders, particularly Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The committee sought to determine whether Biden had used his executive authority to pressure Zelensky into investigating his political opponents.\n\nWitness Credibility\n-------------------\n\nOne of the key witnesses in the impeachment inquiry was Alexander Smirnov, a former Ukrainian diplomat. Smirnov testified before the House Judiciary Committee, alleging that Biden had used his executive authority to pressure Zelensky into investigating his political opponents.\n\nHowever, Smirnov's credibility as a witness was called into question by many Democrats. They argued that Smirnov had a history of making false statements and that his testimony was motivated by a desire for revenge against the Biden administration.\n\n## Alexander Smirnov\n\nAlexander Smirnov is a former Ukrainian diplomat who served as the deputy head of the Ukrainian embassy in Washington, D.C. Smirnov was a key witness in the impeachment inquiry, testifying before the House Judiciary Committee about his interactions with President Biden.\n\nSmirnov alleged that Biden had used his executive authority to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into investigating his political opponents. However, many Democrats questioned Smirnov's credibility, pointing out that he had a history of making false statements.\n\nResponses\n----------\n\nThe impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden elicited a range of responses from different groups and individuals.\n\n## Republican Reaction\n\nMany Republicans welcomed the impeachment inquiry, seeing it as an opportunity to hold the President accountable for his actions. Republican lawmakers argued that the inquiry was necessary to ensure that the President was not abusing his executive authority.\n\n## Democratic Reaction\n\nDemocrats were largely critical of the impeachment inquiry, viewing it as a partisan attack on the President. Many Democrats argued that the inquiry was motivated by a desire to undermine the President's authority and to distract from more pressing issues.\n\n## Reaction from Academics\n\nMany academics and constitutional experts weighed in on the impeachment inquiry, offering their analysis of the President's actions and the constitutional implications of the inquiry. Some experts argued that the President's actions were impeachable, while others argued that the inquiry was a partisan overreach.\n\nAnalysis\n--------\n\nThe impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden raises a number of complex constitutional and legal issues.\n\n## Legal Standing\n\nOne of the key questions surrounding the impeachment inquiry is whether the President's actions meet the constitutional standard for impeachment. The Constitution states that the President can be impeached for \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.\"\n\nMany experts argue that the President's actions do not meet this standard, and that the inquiry is therefore a partisan overreach. However, others argue that the President's actions are impeachable, and that the inquiry is necessary to hold him accountable.\n\nOpinion Polling\n----------------\n\nThe impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden has been the subject of numerous opinion polls, which have sought to gauge public opinion on the issue.\n\n## Support for Inquiry\n\nMany polls have found that a majority of Americans support the impeachment inquiry, with some polls showing that as many as 60% of Americans believe that the inquiry is necessary.\n\n## Support for Impeachment\n\nHowever, support for impeachment itself is more divided, with many polls showing that Americans are split on the issue. Some polls have found that as many as 50% of Americans believe that the President should be impeached, while others have found that as few as 30% believe that impeachment is necessary.\n\nOutcome\n--------\n\nThe outcome of the impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden is uncertain, and it is unclear whether the President will ultimately be impeached.\n\nHowever, regardless of the outcome, the inquiry has already had a significant impact on American politics, highlighting the deep divisions and partisan rancor that exist in the country.\n\nNotes\n------\n\nThis article is a factual summary of the impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden, and it does not express a opinion or bias.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Impeachment_inquiry_into_Joe_Biden\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Initiation of the inquiry\n#House committee investigations\n#Witness credibility\n##Alexander Smirnov\n#Responses\n##Republican reaction\n##Democratic reaction\n##Reaction from academics\n#Analysis\n##Legal standing\n#Opinion polling\n##Support for inquiry\n##Support for impeachment\n#Outcome\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The album marks SZA's first full-length project in over five years, following her critically acclaimed debut album Ctrl (2017). SOS features guest appearances from Don Toliver, Phoebe Bridgers, and Ol' Dirty Bastard, among others.\n\n#Background\n\nSZA began working on SOS in 2019, shortly after the release of her Ctrl deluxe edition. She had initially planned to release the album in 2020, but the COVID-19 pandemic and personal struggles delayed the project. During this time, SZA took a break from music and focused on her mental health and self-care. In 2021, she returned to the studio and started creating new music, experimenting with different sounds and styles.\n\n#Writing and production\n\nSZA wrote or co-wrote all 23 tracks on SOS, often drawing inspiration from her personal experiences, relationships, and emotions. The album features production from a variety of collaborators, including Rodney Jerkins, Don Toliver, and Carter Lang. SZA also worked with Ctrl producers Craig Balmoris and Scum, who contributed to several tracks on the album.\n\nThe writing and production process for SOS was often spontaneous and intuitive. SZA has said that she would often record vocals and melodies in a single take, without prior planning or preparation. This approach allowed her to tap into her emotions and create music that was raw and honest.\n\n#Composition\n\nSOS is a genre-bending album that incorporates elements of R&B, hip-hop, electronic, and indie rock music. The album features a mix of upbeat and slow tempos, with SZA's soulful vocals and introspective lyrics taking center stage.\n\nThe album's sound is characterized by its heavy use of bass, atmospheric synths, and distorted guitar riffs. SZA also incorporates samples and interpolations from various sources, including classic hip-hop tracks and indie rock songs.\n\n#Title and artwork\n\nThe title SOS is an acronym for \"SZA's Overthinking Shit,\" a phrase that reflects the album's themes of anxiety, relationships, and self-discovery. The album's artwork features a photo of SZA taken by her friend and collaborator, Sam McKnight. The image shows SZA with a contemplative expression, surrounded by a halo of light.\n\n#Promotion\n\nSZA announced the release of SOS on November 30, 2022, via social media. She also shared a series of promotional videos and teasers, featuring snippets from the album and behind-the-scenes footage from the recording process.\n\nIn support of the album, SZA embarked on a headlining tour in 2023, with dates in North America, Europe, and Australia. The tour featured a stripped-down setlist and intimate performances, with SZA accompanied by a live band and backing vocalists.\n\n#Critical reception\n\n##Reviews\n\nSOS received widespread critical acclaim upon its release. Reviewers praised SZA's vocal performance, lyrical honesty, and genre-bending sound. Many critics noted that the album marked a significant departure from SZA's earlier work, with a more experimental and introspective approach.\n\nRolling Stone described SOS as \"a masterpiece of modern R&B,\" while The New York Times praised SZA's \"prodigious vocal talent\" and \" emotionally charged songwriting.\" Pitchfork called the album \"a triumph of introspection and innovation,\" while The Guardian noted that SZA \"has never sounded more confident or inventive.\"\n\n##Year-end rankings\n\nSOS appeared on numerous year-end lists, including Rolling Stone's 50 Best Albums of 2022 and Pitchfork's 50 Best Albums of 2022. The album also ranked on The New York Times' 10 Best Albums of 2022 and The Guardian's 50 Best Albums of 2022.\n\n#Awards\n\nSOS has been nominated for several awards, including the Grammy Award for Album of the Year and the BET Award for Album of the Year. SZA also won the BET Award for Best Female Hip-Hop/Rap Artist in 2023.\n\n#Commercial performance\n\nSOS debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart, with 318,000 album-equivalent units earned in its first week. The album also reached number one on the UK Albums Chart and the Australian Albums Chart.\n\nThe album spawned several successful singles, including \"Kill Bill,\" \"Snooze,\" and \"Nobody Gets Me.\" \"Kill Bill\" reached number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, becoming SZA's first number-one single.\n\n#Track listing\n\n1. \"SOS\"\n2. \"Kill Bill\"\n3. \"Seek & Destroy\"\n4. \"Low\"\n5. \"Love Language\"\n6. \"Blind\"\n7. \"Used\" (feat.

This marked the first time the event was held in the United States since 2008.\n\n# Qualification\n\nThe 2022 World Men's Curling Championship featured 13 teams from around the world, with the majority coming from Europe and North America. The qualification process involved a combination of automatic berths, earned through performances at previous world championships, and a qualification event held in January 2022.\n\n## Russian Participation\n\nDue to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the World Curling Federation (WCF) banned Russian teams from competing in the championship. As a result, the Russian men's curling team, which had qualified for the event, was replaced by the Czech Republic.\n\n# Teams\n\nThe 13 teams that participated in the 2022 World Men's Curling Championship were:\n\n*  Canada (Kevin Koe)\n*  China (Ma Xiuyue)\n*  Czech Republic (Lukáš Klíma)\n*  Denmark (Tobias Thune)\n*  Germany (Sixten Totzek)\n*  Italy (Joël Retornaz)\n*  Japan (Riku Yanagisawa)\n*  Norway (Steffen Walstad)\n*  Scotland (Kyle Waddell)\n*  South Korea (Jeong Byeong-jin)\n*  Sweden (Oskar Eriksson)\n*  Switzerland (Yannick Schwaller)\n*  United States (Korey Dropkin)\n\n# Rule changes\n\nThe 2022 World Men's Curling Championship saw the introduction of a new rule, which allowed teams to make one \"power play\" per game. The power play allowed a team to move the free guard zone to the 4-foot zone, potentially creating more scoring opportunities.\n\n# Round-robin standings\n\nThe round-robin stage of the championship featured 13 teams competing in a round-robin format, with each team playing 12 games. The top six teams advanced to the playoffs.\n\n| Rank | Team | W | L |\n| 1 |  Sweden | 10 | 2 |\n| 2 |  Canada | 9 | 3 |\n| 3 |  Scotland | 8 | 4 |\n| 4 |  United States | 7 | 5 |\n| 5 |  Switzerland | 7 | 5 |\n| 6 |  Norway | 6 | 6 |\n| 7 |  Italy | 6 | 6 |\n| 8 |  Japan | 5 | 7 |\n| 9 |  South Korea | 5 | 7 |\n| 10 |  Germany | 4 | 8 |\n| 11 |  Denmark | 3 | 9 |\n| 12 |  Czech Republic | 2 | 10 |\n| 13 |  China | 1 | 11 |\n\n# Round-robin results\n\n## Draw 1\n\n*  Canada 7,  China 3\n*  Sweden 8,  Czech Republic 5\n*  United States 6,  Japan 5\n*  Scotland 7,  Denmark 4\n*  Switzerland 8,  Germany 2\n*  Norway 7,  Italy 5\n*  South Korea 6,  Italy 5 (extra end)\n\n## Draw 2\n\n*  Scotland 7,  Norway 3\n*  Canada 9,  Germany 3\n*  Sweden 7,  Japan 4\n*  United States 7,  Denmark 2\n*  Switzerland 7,  South Korea 3\n*  Czech Republic 7,  China 6 (extra end)\n\n## Draw 3\n\n*  Italy 8,  Denmark 4\n*  Japan 7,  Norway 5\n*  Switzerland 7,  Canada 5\n*  Sweden 8,  South Korea 3\n*  Scotland 6,  Czech Republic 5\n*  United States 9,  China 2\n\n## Draw 4\n\n*  Norway 8,  China 2\n*  Japan 8,  Czech Republic 3\n*  United States 8,  Italy 3\n*  Canada 7,  South Korea 5\n*  Switzerland 8,  Denmark 2\n*  Scotland 7,  Germany 4\n\n## Draw 5\n\n*  Switzerland 8,  Norway 6\n*  Canada 8,  Japan 3\n*  Sweden 9,  Italy 5\n*  United States 8,  Germany 4\n*  Scotland 9,  China 1\n*  South Korea 8,  Czech Republic 3\n\n## Draw 6\n\n*  Japan 8,  Italy 5\n*  Scotland 7,  United States 6\n*  Switzerland 8,  Czech Republic 4\n*  Sweden 8,  Norway 5\n*  Canada 9,  Denmark 3\n*  Germany 7,  South Korea 5\n\n## Draw 7\n\n*  Norway 8,  Czech Republic 2\n*  Sweden 8,  Scotland 2\n*  Italy 8,  Germany 5\n*  United States 7,  Switzerland 4\n*  Japan 9,  South Korea 4\n*  Canada 10,  China 2\n\n## Draw 8\n\n*  Switzerland 9,  Italy 3\n*  Canada 7,  Norway 6\n*  United States 9,  Czech Republic 2\n*  Sweden 7,  Germany 3\n*  Scotland 8,  Japan 4\n*  South Korea 8,  Denmark 5\n\n## Draw 9\n\n*  Germany 8,  China 5\n*  Scotland 7,  Switzerland 5\n*  United States 8,  Norway 4\n*  Canada 8,  Italy 5\n*  Japan 9,  Denmark 3\n*  Sweden 9,  Czech Republic 2\n\n## Draw 10\n\n*  Italy 9,  China 3\n*  Sweden 8,  United States 5\n*  Scotland 8,  South Korea 4\n*  Norway 8,  Germany 5\n*  Canada 9,  Czech Republic 4\n*  Switzerland 8,  Japan 4\n\n## Draw 11\n\n*  Czech Republic 9,  Italy 5\n*  Scotland 8,  Canada 7\n*  Norway 9,  South Korea 6\n*  United States 9,  Germany 2\n*  Sweden 8,  Denmark 2\n*  Switzerland 8,  China 3\n\n## Draw 12\n\n*  Japan 9,  Germany 5\n*  Norway 8,  Canada 3\n*  Switzerland 8,  Sweden 6\n*  Scotland 9,  Italy 5\n*  United States 8,  South Korea 4\n*  Czech Republic 8,  Denmark 6\n\n## Draw 13\n\n*  South Korea 9,  China 4\n*  Italy 9,  Czech Republic 2\n*  Japan 8,  Switzerland 6\n*  United States 8,  Canada 4\n*  Scotland 8,  Sweden 7 (extra end)\n*  Norway 9,  Denmark 6\n\n## Draw 14\n\n*  Sweden 9,  Japan 3\n*  Canada 8,  Switzerland 5\n*  Norway 8,  United States 7\n*  Scotland 8,  Germany 4\n*  South Korea 10,  China 4\n*  Italy 8,  Czech Republic 6\n\n## Draw 15\n\n*  Germany 8,  Czech Republic 5\n*  Canada 9,  Sweden 4\n*  Switzerland 9,  Norway 5\n*  Japan 8,  Scotland 4\n*  United States 8,  South Korea 6\n*  Denmark 9,  China 6\n\n## Draw 16\n\n*  Norway 8,  Scotland 6\n*  United States 8,  Japan 5\n*  Canada 8,  Germany 6\n*  Sweden 9,  South Korea 4\n*  Switzerland 9,  Czech Republic 2\n*  Italy 9,  China 4\n\n## Draw 17\n\n*  Scotland 9,  China 3\n*  Sweden 8,  Norway 3\n*  Japan 9,  Canada 4\n*  United States 9,  Italy 5\n*  Switzerland 8,  Germany 4\n*  South Korea 9,  Czech Republic 6\n\n## Draw 18\n\n*  Norway 9,  Germany 7\n*  Scotland 9,  South Korea 4\n*  Japan 9,  Italy 6\n*  Canada 8,  Switzerland 5\n*  United States 8,  Sweden 6\n*  Czech Republic 9,  China 7\n\n## Draw 19\n\n*  Canada 9,  Norway 6\n*  Japan 8,  Switzerland 7\n*  United States 9,  Germany 4\n*  Scotland 8,  Czech Republic 3\n*  Italy 9,  South Korea 5\n*  Sweden 9,  China 2\n\n## Draw 20\n\n*  Switzerland 9,  Italy 6\n*  Norway 9,  Japan 6\n*  Canada 9,  United States 5\n*  Sweden 8,  Scotland 6\n*  South Korea 10,  Germany 6\n*  Czech Republic 9,  Denmark 6\n\n# Playoffs\n\nThe playoffs featured the top six teams from the round-robin stage, competing in a single-elimination format.\n\n## Qualification games\n\n*  Norway 8,  United States 4\n*  Switzerland 7,  Scotland 4\n\n## Semifinals\n\n*  Sweden 8,  Norway 4\n*  Canada 8,  Switzerland 4\n\n## Bronze-medal game\n\n*  Switzerland 8,  Norway 6\n\n## Final\n\n*  Sweden 8,  Canada 4\n\n# Statistics\n\n## Top 5 player percentages\n\n*  Niklas Edin (Sweden) -

This article provides a comprehensive overview of the meteorological conditions that led to the outbreak, the confirmed tornadoes, non-tornadic effects, and the aftermath of the event.\n\n# Meteorological synopsis\n\nThe tornado outbreak of March 24–27, 2023, was the result of a complex weather pattern involving a strong low-pressure system, a cold front, and a dry line. The combination of these factors created a highly unstable atmosphere, conducive to the development of severe thunderstorms and tornadoes.\n\n## March 24–25\n\nOn March 24, a strong low-pressure system developed over the Great Plains, bringing with it a cold front and a dry line. As the system moved eastward, it encountered a warm and moist air mass from the Gulf of Mexico, creating a highly unstable atmosphere. This led to the development of severe thunderstorms across the Southern United States, including Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia.\n\n## March 26–27\n\nOn March 26, the low-pressure system continued to move eastward, bringing the cold front and dry line into the Southeastern United States. This led to the development of a strong squall line, which produced numerous tornadoes across the region. The storms were fueled by strong wind shear and a highly unstable atmosphere, resulting in long-lived and intense tornadoes.\n\n# Confirmed tornadoes\n\nA total of 131 tornadoes were confirmed during the outbreak, with the majority occurring on March 26. The tornadoes affected multiple states, including Mississippi, Georgia, and Alabama.\n\n## March 24 event\n\nA total of 15 tornadoes were confirmed on March 24, primarily affecting Mississippi and Alabama.

The election was a significant event in Swedish politics, marking a shift in the country's political landscape.\n\n# Background\n\n## Löfven's Government\n\nThe 2018 Swedish general election had resulted in a hung parliament, with the Social Democratic Party (SAP) emerging as the largest party. Stefan Löfven, the leader of the SAP, formed a coalition government with the Green Party (MP) and received support from the Left Party (V) and the Centre Party (C) in the Riksdag. However, the government was weakened by internal conflicts and disagreements over policy issues. In June 2021, Löfven resigned as Prime Minister after losing a vote of no confidence in the Riksdag.\n\n## Andersson's Government\n\nFollowing Löfven's resignation, Magdalena Andersson, the leader of the SAP, formed a new government with the Green Party (MP). Andersson's government was also a minority government and relied on the support of the Left Party (V) and the Centre Party (C) to pass legislation in the Riksdag. However, the government was short-lived, and Andersson resigned as Prime Minister in September 2022 after losing a vote of no confidence in the Riksdag.\n\n# Electoral System\n\nThe Swedish electoral system is based on proportional representation, with voters casting ballots for a party or a candidate within a party. The 349 members of the Riksdag are elected from 29 constituencies, with each constituency allocated a number of seats based on its population.\n\n## Political Parties\n\nEight parties were represented in the Riksdag prior to the 2022 election:\n\n1. Social Democratic Party (SAP)\n2. Moderate Party (M)\n3. Sweden Democrats (SD)\n4. Centre Party (C)\n5. Left Party (V)\n6. Christian Democrats (KD)\n7. Liberal Party (L)\n8.

Immigration: The Sweden Democrats (SD) and the Moderate Party (M) advocated for stricter immigration policies, while the Social Democratic Party (SAP) and the Green Party (MP) argued for a more liberal approach.\n3. Economic policy: The Social Democratic Party (SAP) and the Left Party (V) advocated for increased public spending and taxation, while the Moderate Party (M) and the Centre Party (C) argued for reduced public spending and lower taxes.\n\n## Party Campaigns\n\nEach party launched its own campaign, with the Social Democratic Party (SAP) focusing on its record in government and the Moderate Party (M) emphasizing its commitment to economic reform. The Sweden Democrats (SD) launched a populist campaign, emphasizing the need for stricter immigration policies and increased law and order.\n\n## Slogans\n\nSome notable slogans from the campaign were:\n\n* Social Democratic Party (SAP): \"For a better Sweden\"\n* Moderate Party (M): \"A new direction for Sweden\"\n* Sweden Democrats (SD): \"Sweden first\"\n* Green Party (MP): \"For the climate, for the future\"\n\n## Debates\n\nSeveral debates were held during the campaign, including a televised debate between the leaders of the eight parties represented in the Riksdag. The debates were marked by intense discussion and disagreement on key issues.\n\n# Opinion Polls\n\nOpinion polls were conducted throughout the campaign, with the Social Democratic Party (SAP) and the Moderate Party (M) consistently polling as the two largest parties. The Sweden Democrats (SD) also polled strongly, while the Green Party (MP) and the Left Party (V) struggled to gain traction.\n\n# Results\n\nThe results of the 2022 Swedish general election were as follows:\n\n## By Bloc\n\n| Bloc | Seats |\n| --- | --- |\n| Red-Green Bloc (SAP, MP, V) | 174 |\n| Centre-Right Bloc (M, C, KD, L) | 175 |\n\n## Voter Demographics\n\nThe voter demographics were as follows:\n\n* Turnout: 84.2%\n* Male voters: 50.4%\n* Female voters: 49.6%\n* Voters aged 18-29: 22.1%\n* Voters aged 30-49: 34.5%\n* Voters aged 50-64: 26.4%\n* Voters aged 65+: 17.0%\n\n## By Constituency\n\nThe results by constituency were as follows:\n\n* Stockholm County: Moderate Party (M) 24.1%, Social Democratic Party (SAP) 23.4%\n* Västra Götaland County: Social Democratic Party (SAP) 25.5%, Moderate Party (M) 20.5%\n* Skåne County: Social Democratic Party (SAP) 26.3%, Sweden Democrats (SD) 20.5%\n\n## Seat Distribution\n\nThe seat distribution was as follows:\n\n| Party | Seats |\n| --- | --- |\n| Social Democratic Party (SAP) | 107 |\n| Moderate Party (M) | 68 |\n| Sweden Democrats (SD) | 73 |\n| Centre Party (C) | 24 |\n| Left Party (V) | 24 |\n| Christian Democrats (KD) | 19 |\n| Liberal Party (L) | 16 |\n| Green Party (MP) | 18 |\n\n## Maps\n\nMaps of the election results showed a mixed picture, with the Social Democratic Party (SAP) performing strongly in urban areas and the Moderate Party (M) performing well in rural areas.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe aftermath of the election was marked by intense discussion and negotiation over the formation of a new government.\n\n## Government Formation\n\nThe Centre-Right Bloc (M, C, KD, L) emerged as the largest bloc, but the Moderate Party (M) was unable to form a government without the support of the Sweden Democrats (SD). The Sweden Democrats (SD) refused to support a Moderate Party (M) government, leading to a period of uncertainty and instability.\n\n# See Also\n\n* 2018 Swedish general election\n* 2022 Swedish government formation\n* Swedish politics\n\n# References\n\n*N/A*\n\n# External Links\n\n*N/A*", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Swedish_general_election\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Löfven's government\n##Andersson's government\n#Electoral system\n##Political parties\n##Pre-election composition\n#Campaign\n##Issues\n##Party campaigns\n##Slogans\n##Debates\n#Opinion polls\n#Results\n##By bloc\n##Voter demographics\n##By constituency\n##Seat distribution\n##Maps\n#Aftermath\n##Government formation\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He graduated with a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1972 and was called to the bar in 1974. Wickremesinghe's early career was marked by a strong interest in politics, and he joined the United National Party (UNP) in 1966, while still a student.\n\n#Political career\n\n##Batalanda incident\n\nWickremesinghe's entry into politics was marked by controversy, with his involvement in the Batalanda incident in 1989. The incident, which involved the alleged torture and murder of several individuals at a safe house in Batalanda, was widely condemned, and Wickremesinghe was accused of being involved in the incident. Wickremesinghe has consistently denied any wrongdoing, but the incident has continued to haunt him throughout his career.\n\n##First premiership (1993–1994)\n\nWickremesinghe's first stint as Prime Minister began in 1993, when he was appointed by President Dingiri Banda Wijetunga.

The peace talks, which were facilitated by Norway, resulted in the signing of a ceasefire agreement in 2002.\n\n##Opposition (2004–2015)\n\nWickremesinghe's second premiership came to an end in 2004, when the UNP lost the general election to the United People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA).

Wickremesinghe's campaign was marked by a series of controversies, including allegations of corruption and abuse of power.\n\n###Dissent within the UNP\n\nIn 2010, Wickremesinghe faced a leadership challenge from within the UNP, with several members of the party calling for his resignation. Wickremesinghe survived the challenge, but the incident highlighted the deep divisions within the party.\n\n###End of the civil war and 2010 presidential election\n\nIn 2009, the civil war came to an end, with the defeat of the LTTE at the hands of the government.

With a rich cultural heritage and stunning natural beauty, Lahaina is a popular tourist destination and a significant cultural center in Hawaii. This article provides an overview of the town's history, geography, demographics, arts and culture, sports, and popular culture.\n\n# History\n\nLahaina's history dates back to the early 19th century, when it was a major center of commerce, politics, and culture in Hawaii.\n\n## Name\n\n### Modern name, etymology and pronunciations\n\nThe modern name \"Lahaina\" is derived from the Hawaiian words \"la\" meaning \"sun\" and \"haina\" meaning \"cruel\" or \"relentless\". The name is often pronounced as \"lah-HY-nah\" or \"lah-HAH-nah\" by locals and visitors alike.\n\n### Ancient names\n\nIn ancient times, the area now known as Lahaina was called \"Lele\" or \"Lelena\", which referred to the abundant Maui parrotbill birds that inhabited the area.\n\n## Early rulers\n\nLahaina was once the capital of the Kingdom of Maui, ruled by the powerful ali'i (chiefs) of Maui. One of the most notable rulers of Lahaina was Pi'ilani, who united the island of Maui under one rule in the 16th century.\n\n## Western contact\n\n### Kahekili II\n\nIn 1786, King Kahekili II of Maui, who ruled Lahaina at the time, encountered the first European explorers, including Captain George Vancouver. Kahekili II was known for his fierce resistance to European influence and his efforts to maintain Hawaiian independence.\n\n### Kamehameha I and Kamehameha II\n\nIn 1810, King Kamehameha I, who had unified the islands of Hawaii, visited Lahaina and established it as the capital of the Kingdom of Hawaii. His son, Kamehameha II, continued to rule from Lahaina until 1820, when the capital was moved to Honolulu.\n\n### Christian missionaries\n\nIn 1820, the first Christian missionaries arrived in Lahaina, led by Hiram Bingham. The missionaries had a significant impact on Hawaiian culture, introducing Christianity and Western education to the islands.\n\n### Whaling\n\nDuring the 19th century, Lahaina became a major center for the whaling industry, with many ships visiting the town's harbor. The whaling industry brought significant economic growth to the area, but also had a profound impact on the local environment and culture.\n\n### Kamehameha III\n\nIn 1825, King Kamehameha III, who ruled from Lahaina, introduced the first written laws in Hawaii, which included the establishment of a constitutional monarchy.\n\n### 20th century\n\nIn the 20th century, Lahaina underwent significant changes, including the growth of the tourism industry and the development of new infrastructure. In 1962, the town was officially designated as a historic district, and many of its historic buildings were restored and preserved.\n\n## 2023 wildfire\n\nIn August 2023, a devastating wildfire swept through Lahaina, destroying much of the town and forcing thousands of residents and tourists to evacuate. The fire was one of the largest and most destructive in Hawaiian history, and it had a profound impact on the community and the local economy.\n\n# Geography\n\nLahaina is located on the western coast of Maui, approximately 45 miles northwest of Kahului. The town is situated in a valley surrounded by the West Maui Mountains, which rise to over 5,000 feet in elevation.\n\n## Climate\n\nLahaina has a tropical savanna climate, characterized by warm temperatures and high levels of humidity throughout the year. The average temperature in Lahaina is around 78°F (25°C), with average annual rainfall of around 20 inches (500 mm).\n\n# Demographics\n\nAs of the 2020 United States Census, the population of Lahaina was approximately 12,000 people. The town has a diverse population, with a mix of Native Hawaiians, Asian Americans, and people of European descent.\n\n# Arts and culture\n\nLahaina is known for its rich cultural heritage, which reflects its history as a major center of commerce, politics, and culture in Hawaii. The town is home to many museums, art galleries, and cultural centers, including the Lahaina Heritage Trail, which showcases the town's historic sites and landmarks.\n\n# Sports\n\nLahaina is home to several sports teams, including the Lahaina Warriors, which compete in the Maui Interscholastic League. The town also hosts several major sporting events, including the Lahaina Invitational, which attracts top high school basketball teams from around the world.\n\n# Popular culture\n\nLahaina has been featured in numerous films, television shows, and books, including the popular novel \"South Sea Tales\" by Robert Louis Stevenson. The town's historic sites and landmarks have also been used as filming locations for several major motion pictures.\n\n# Gallery\n\n* Historic Lahaina Front Street\n* Lahaina Heritage Trail\n* Banyan Tree Park\n* Lahaina Harbor\n* Maui parrotbill bird\n\n# See also\n\n* List of historic sites in Hawaii\n* List of museums in Hawaii\n* Maui, Hawaii\n* Kingdom of Hawaii\n* Hawaiian culture\n\n# Notes\n\n* This article is based on information available up to 2023 and may not reflect changes or updates since that time.\n\n# External links\n\n* Official website of the Lahaina Restoration Foundation\n* Official website of the Maui Visitors and Convention Bureau\n* Historic Lahaina Foundation\n* Lahaina Heritage Trail", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Lahaina,_Hawaii\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Name\n###Modern name, etymology and pronunciations\n###Ancient names\n##Early rulers\n##Western contact\n###Kahekili II\n###Kamehameha I and Kamehameha II\n###Christian missionaries\n###Whaling\n###Kamehameha III\n###20th century\n##2023 wildfire\n#Geography\n##Climate\n#Demographics\n#Arts and culture\n#Sports\n#Popular culture\n#Gallery\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The outbreak produced numerous tornadoes across several states, resulting in widespread damage and loss of life. This article provides an overview of the meteorological conditions that led to the outbreak, the confirmed tornadoes, non-tornadic effects, preparations and impacts, and the aftermath.\n\n# Meteorological Synopsis\n\nThe tornado outbreak was caused by a complex weather system that developed over the southern United States on March 20, 2022. A potent low-pressure system formed over the southern Great Plains, bringing with it a mass of warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico. As this system interacted with a cold front moving southward from Canada, a powerful storm system developed, producing a large area of thunderstorms across the southern United States.\n\n## March 21\n\nOn March 21, a strong upper-level disturbance moved into the southern United States, providing the necessary lift for thunderstorms to develop. As the day progressed, a large area of thunderstorms developed across the southern Great Plains, with some storms becoming supercells. These supercells produced several tornadoes, with the first reported tornado occurring in western Oklahoma.\n\n## March 22\n\nOn March 22, the storm system continued to intensify, with a strong low-pressure system developing over eastern Texas. This low-pressure system brought with it a mass of warm, moist air, which fueled the development of thunderstorms across the southeastern United States. As the day progressed, a large area of thunderstorms developed, with some storms becoming supercells. These supercells produced numerous tornadoes, with the hardest-hit areas being eastern Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi.\n\n## March 23\n\nOn March 23, the storm system began to weaken, but not before producing several more tornadoes. The final tornado of the outbreak occurred in southern Alabama. As the storm system moved eastward, it brought heavy rain and strong winds to the eastern United States, causing significant flooding and power outages.\n\n# Confirmed Tornadoes\n\nA total of 73 tornadoes were confirmed during the outbreak, with the majority occurring on March 22.\n\n## March 21 Event\n\nA total of 5 tornadoes were confirmed on March 21, with the majority occurring in western Oklahoma. The strongest tornado of the day was an EF2 that occurred in Beckham County, Oklahoma.\n\n## March 22 Event\n\nA total of 55 tornadoes were confirmed on March 22, with the majority occurring in eastern Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. The strongest tornado of the day was an EF4 that occurred in Catahoula Parish, Louisiana.\n\n## March 23 Event\n\nA total of 13 tornadoes were confirmed on March 23, with the majority occurring in southern Alabama. The strongest tornado of the day was an EF2 that occurred in Mobile County, Alabama.\n\n## Gretna–Arabi–New Orleans East, Louisiana\n\nOne of the most significant tornadoes of the outbreak occurred in Gretna, Arabi, and New Orleans East, Louisiana. This EF3 tornado caused significant damage and loss of life, with entire neighborhoods being destroyed. The tornado was estimated to have reached wind speeds of up to 165 mph.\n\n# Non-Tornadic Effects\n\nIn addition to the tornadoes, the storm system produced significant non-tornadic effects, including heavy rain, strong winds, and large hail. The heavy rain caused significant flooding across the southern United States, with some areas receiving over 10 inches of rain. The strong winds caused widespread power outages, with over 100,000 households losing electricity. The large hail caused significant damage to crops and vehicles.\n\n# Preparations and Impacts\n\nAs the storm system approached, residents across the southern United States prepared for the worst. Many schools and businesses were closed, and evacuation orders were issued for some areas. As the tornadoes occurred, emergency responders were quickly deployed to affected areas.

Imran Khan, the 22nd Prime Minister of Pakistan, was shot at and injured while leading a protest march towards Islamabad. The incident sent shockwaves across the country and sparked widespread outrage.\n\n# Background\n\n## Ousting of Imran Khan\n\nImran Khan was ousted as the Prime Minister of Pakistan on April 10, 2022, through a no-confidence vote in the National Assembly. This move was seen as a major setback for Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, which had been in power since 2018. The ousting was the result of a long-standing feud between Khan and the opposition parties, particularly the Pakistan Muslim League (N) (PML-N) and the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP). Khan had been facing criticism for his handling of the economy, foreign policy, and governance.\n\n## 2022 Azadi March-II\n\nIn response to his ousting, Imran Khan announced a march towards Islamabad, dubbed the \"Azadi March-II\", to demand fresh elections and protest against the government. The march began on October 28, 2022, from Lahore and was expected to reach Islamabad on November 4. The march was seen as a major challenge to the government, which had imposed Section 144 (prohibiting public gatherings) in several cities. Khan had been leading the march from a container on a truck, addressing crowds and repeating his demands for fresh elections.\n\n# Shooting\n\nOn November 3, 2022, while Khan was leading the march in Wazirabad, a gunman opened fire at the container. Khan was shot in the leg and injured, while several others were also wounded. The incident occurred around 4:30 pm local time, when the march was passing through the Wazirabad area. Eyewitnesses reported that the gunman fired multiple shots, and Khan was quickly rushed to a hospital for treatment.\n\n# Suspects\n\nThe police arrested a suspect, identified as Naveed, from the scene of the crime. Naveed was reportedly a 40-year-old resident of Wazirabad, who had been identified as a suspect after eyewitnesses reported seeing him firing shots at Khan's container. The police recovered a 9mm pistol from the suspect and claimed that he had confessed to the crime. However, the motive behind the attack was not immediately clear.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## Domestic\n\nThe attempted assassination of Imran Khan sparked widespread outrage across Pakistan. PTI supporters took to the streets, protesting against the government and demanding justice for Khan. The opposition parties, including the PML-N and the PPP, condemned the attack and expressed solidarity with Khan. The government, led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, also condemned the attack and ordered an investigation.\n\n## International\n\nThe international community also condemned the attack, with several countries expressing concern for Khan's safety. The United States, the United Kingdom, and China were among the countries that issued statements condemning the attack. The United Nations also issued a statement, expressing concern for the safety of politicians and the need for peaceful dialogue in Pakistan.\n\n# See also\n\n* Imran Khan\n* Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf\n* 2022 Azadi March-II\n* Ousting of Imran Khan\n* Shehbaz Sharif\n* Pakistan Muslim League (N)\n* Pakistan Peoples Party", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Attempted_assassination_of_Imran_Khan\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Ousting of Imran Khan\n##2022 Azadi March-II\n#Shooting\n#Suspects\n#Reactions\n##Domestic\n##International\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Located in what is now southwestern Romania, the Banat of Craiova was a strategic region that played a significant role in the complex history of the Balkans during the early 18th century.\n\n#History\n\nThe history of the Banat of Craiova is marked by periods of conquest, resistance, and eventual reconquest. The region's strategic location made it a prized possession for various empires and powers, leading to a complex and often tumultuous past.\n\n##Austrian conquest\n\nIn 1716, the Habsburg Empire, under the leadership of Prince Eugene of Savoy, launched a campaign against the Ottoman Empire, which had controlled the region for nearly two centuries. The Austrians achieved a decisive victory at the Battle of Petrovaradin, and by 1718, they had occupied the region that would become the Banat of Craiova.\n\n##Government creation\n\nFollowing the conquest, the Habsburgs established the Banat of Craiova as a distinct administrative division, separate from the neighboring Banat of Temesvar. The new government was headed by a governor, who was responsible for implementing imperial policies and maintaining order in the region.\n\n##Boyar and peasant resistance\n\nThe establishment of the Banat of Craiova was met with resistance from the local boyar class, who had traditionally held power in the region. The boyars, who were primarily of Romanian and Bulgarian origin, resented the imposition of Austrian rule and the erosion of their privileges. Peasants, who made up the majority of the population, also opposed the Austrian government, which had introduced new taxes and labor obligations.\n\n##Austrian consolidation\n\nDespite the initial resistance, the Austrians were able to consolidate their control over the Banat of Craiova through a combination of military force and administrative reforms. The government implemented policies aimed at promoting economic development, including the establishment of new trade routes and the encouragement of immigration from other parts of the empire.\n\n##Ottoman reconquest\n\nIn 1737, the Ottoman Empire, which had been weakened by internal conflicts and external pressures, launched a counterattack against the Austrians. The Ottomans were able to recapture the Banat of Craiova, and the region was returned to Ottoman control. The Austrians were forced to withdraw, and the Banat of Craiova ceased to exist as a distinct administrative division.\n\n#Legacy\n\nThe Banat of Craiova played a significant role in shaping the modern history of the Balkans, and its legacy can still be seen today.\n\n##\"Colonial\" precedent\n\nThe establishment of the Banat of Craiova as a colonial-style administration, with a governor and a centralized bureaucracy, set a precedent for later European powers that sought to expand their empires in the region. The Austrians' use of administrative reforms and economic incentives to consolidate their control also influenced later colonial powers.\n\n##Cultural survivals\n\nDespite the brief duration of the Banat of Craiova, the region's cultural heritage was significantly impacted by the Austrian presence. Many of the region's cities, including Craiova, still retain architectural and cultural elements from the Austrian period, including Baroque-style buildings and cultural institutions.\n\n#Symbols\n\nThe Banat of Craiova did not have any official symbols or emblems during its existence. However, the region's cultural heritage is still celebrated through various festivals and traditions, including the annual Craiova Festival, which showcases the region's music, dance, and crafts.\n\n#Notes\n\nThe Banat of Craiova was a short-lived but significant administrative division that played a crucial role in shaping the modern history of the Balkans. Its legacy can still be seen in the region's cultural heritage and its impact on later European powers that sought to expand their empires in the region.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Banat_of_Craiova\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Austrian conquest\n##Government creation\n##Boyar and peasant resistance\n##Austrian consolidation\n##Ottoman reconquest\n#Legacy\n##\"Colonial\" precedent\n##Cultural survivals\n#Symbols\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The election was called following the dissolution of the 14th Malaysian Parliament on 10 October 2022. The election saw the participation of 945 candidates from various political parties and coalitions, contesting for 222 parliamentary seats and 600 state legislative seats.\n\n# Background\n\n## Previous Election\n\nThe 14th Malaysian general election was held on 9 May 2018, which saw the Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition, led by Mahathir Mohamad, winning a majority of 113 seats in the Dewan Rakyat, the lower house of the Malaysian Parliament. The Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition, which had ruled Malaysia since independence in 1957, suffered a major defeat, winning only 79 seats.\n\n## Significant Events\n\nSeveral significant events took place in the lead-up to the 2022 general election. In February 2020, the Pakatan Harapan government, led by Mahathir Mohamad, collapsed following a series of defections by several Members of Parliament (MPs). This led to the formation of a new government, led by Muhyiddin Yassin, which was supported by the BN coalition and several other parties.\n\nIn January 2021, a state of emergency was declared in Malaysia due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to the suspension of parliamentary activities. The emergency was lifted in August 2021, following which the 14th Malaysian Parliament reconvened.\n\n## 2020–22 Political Crisis\n\nThe period between 2020 and 2022 saw a series of political crises in Malaysia. In February 2020, the Pakatan Harapan government collapsed, leading to the formation of a new government. In July 2021, the Prime Minister, Muhyiddin Yassin, faced a confidence vote in parliament, which he won narrowly.\n\nHowever, in August 2021, the Prime Minister resigned following a series of defections by several MPs. He was replaced by Ismail Sabri Yaakob, who formed a new government with the support of the BN coalition and several other parties.\n\n# Electoral System\n\nMalaysia uses a first-past-the-post electoral system, in which the candidate with the most votes in a constituency wins the seat. The country is divided into 222 parliamentary constituencies, each of which elects one MP to the Dewan Rakyat.

The explosion, which was one of the most significant events of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, had far-reaching consequences for both Ukraine and Russia.\n\n#Background\n\nThe Crimean Bridge, also known as the Kerch Strait Bridge, is a pair of parallel bridges spanning the Kerch Strait, which connects the Black Sea to the Sea of Azov. The bridge, which was opened in 2018, is the longest bridge in Europe, stretching 19 kilometers (12 miles) in length. The bridge is a critical transportation link between Russia and Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014. The bridge carries both road and rail traffic, and is a vital artery for the movement of goods and people between Russia and Crimea.\n\nIn the months leading up to the explosion, the bridge had become an increasingly important target for Ukrainian forces, who had been seeking to disrupt Russian supply lines and weaken the Russian military's grip on Crimea. The bridge had also become a symbol of Russian power and influence in the region, and its destruction was seen as a significant blow to Russian prestige.\n\n#Event\n\nOn October 8, 2022, at approximately 6:00 am local time, a massive explosion occurred on the Crimean Bridge, causing widespread damage to the structure. The explosion, which was reportedly triggered by a truck bomb, sent a large fireball into the air, and was heard and felt for miles around. The blast caused significant damage to the bridge's road and rail sections, and also damaged several nearby buildings and vehicles.\n\nThe explosion was immediately followed by a series of smaller explosions, which were reportedly caused by the ignition of fuel tankers and other vehicles on the bridge. The fires were eventually brought under control, but not before they had caused significant additional damage to the bridge.\n\n#Immediate impact\n\nThe immediate impact of the explosion was chaos and disruption, as traffic on the bridge came to a standstill, and nearby residents were evacuated from their homes. The explosion also caused significant disruptions to Russian supply lines, as the bridge was a key route for the movement of goods and equipment to Russian forces in Ukraine.\n\nThe explosion also had a significant impact on global markets, as oil prices rose sharply in response to the news. The explosion was seen as a major escalation of the conflict between Ukraine and Russia, and raised concerns about the potential for further disruptions to global energy supplies.\n\n#Structural damage to the bridges\n\nThe explosion caused significant structural damage to the bridge, including the collapse of several sections of the road and rail decks.

From its pre-Roman era to the present day, the county has played a significant role in shaping the course of English history. This article provides an overview of the major events, periods, and developments that have shaped the history of County Durham.\n\n#Roman and pre-Roman\n\nThe earliest known human habitation in the area now known as County Durham dates back to the Mesolithic period, around 8000 BC. Archaeological evidence suggests that the region was inhabited by various tribes, including the Brigantes and the Votadini, before the Roman conquest of Britain in the 1st century AD. The Romans established a fort at Binchester, near modern-day Bishop Auckland, and a settlement at Escomb, which is now a small village.\n\n#Anglo-Saxon\n\n##Anglian Kingdom of Bernicia\n\nFollowing the Roman withdrawal from Britain in the 5th century AD, the area now known as County Durham was settled by the Anglo-Saxons. The kingdom of Bernicia, which stretched from the Humber Estuary to the Firth of Forth, was established in the 6th century. Bernicia was eventually absorbed into the kingdom of Northumbria, which was a major power in Anglo-Saxon England.\n\n##Kingdom of Northumbria\n\nThe kingdom of Northumbria, which was formed in the 7th century, played a significant role in the development of County Durham. The kingdom was a major center of learning and culture, and its capital, York, was an important hub of trade and commerce. Northumbria was eventually divided into two kingdoms, Bernicia and Deira, which were later reunited under a single ruler.\n\n#City of Durham founded\n\nThe city of Durham was founded in 995 AD by monks from Lindisfarne, who were fleeing from Viking raids. The monks established a new monastery on a rocky outcrop overlooking the River Wear, and the city grew up around it. Durham became an important center of learning and pilgrimage, and its cathedral, which was built in the 11th century, is one of the finest examples of Norman architecture in England.\n\n#Norman and Anglo-Norman\n\nThe Norman Conquest of England in 1066 had a profound impact on County Durham. The Normans introduced their own system of government, language, and culture, which gradually replaced the Anglo-Saxon way of life. The county was granted to the Bishop of Durham, who became one of the most powerful men in the north of England.\n\n#County Palatine of Durham\n\nThe County Palatine of Durham was a unique entity that existed from the 12th to the 19th century. The county was governed by the Bishop of Durham, who had almost complete control over its administration, laws, and finances. The bishop was responsible for collecting taxes, maintaining law and order, and providing military forces in times of war.\n\n##Early administration\n\nThe County Palatine of Durham was administered from the city of Durham, which was the seat of the bishop's power. The county was divided into several districts, each of which was governed by a local official known as a \"steward.\" The stewards were responsible for collecting taxes, maintaining roads and bridges, and providing military forces in times of war.\n\n##Boundaries, exclaves and population\n\nThe County Palatine of Durham had a complex system of boundaries, which included several exclaves and enclaves. The county was bounded by the River Tees to the south, the North Sea to the east, and the Scottish border to the north. The population of the county was largely rural, with many people living in small villages and hamlets.\n\n##Survey\n\nA survey of the county was conducted in the 13th century, which provided valuable information about its population, economy, and administration. The survey showed that the county was largely agricultural, with many people employed in farming and related industries.\n\n##Palatinate\n\nThe Palatinate of Durham was a unique entity that existed from the 12th to the 19th century. The palatinate was governed by the Bishop of Durham, who had almost complete control over its administration, laws, and finances. The bishop was responsible for collecting taxes, maintaining law and order, and providing military forces in times of war.\n\n##Wars\n\nCounty Durham played a significant role in several wars throughout its history, including the Wars of the Roses, the English Civil War, and the Napoleonic Wars. The county was an important center of military recruitment, and many of its men fought in battles both at home and abroad.\n\n##Parliamentary representation and secular powers\n\nThe County Palatine of Durham was represented in Parliament by two members, who were elected by the freeholders of the county. The bishop of Durham also had a seat in the House of Lords, which gave him a significant voice in national affairs. The secular powers of the bishop were gradually eroded over the centuries, and the county eventually became subject to the same laws and administration as the rest of England.\n\n#Later government\n\nThe County Palatine of Durham was abolished in the 19th century, and the county became subject to the same laws and administration as the rest of England. The county council was established in 1889, which provided a new system of local government. The county council was responsible for providing a range of services, including education, healthcare, and highways.\n\n#Eighteenth century\n\nThe 18th century was a time of significant change and development in County Durham.

The bank received a bailout from the Swiss government and underwent significant restructuring efforts to restore its financial health.\n\n##Losses in investment banking arm\n\nIn the years following the financial crisis, Credit Suisse continued to face challenges, particularly in its investment banking arm. The bank suffered significant losses due to a series of ill-fated trades and investments, which further eroded its financial stability. Despite efforts to revamp its investment banking business, Credit Suisse struggled to regain its footing and compete with larger rivals.\n\n##March 2023 United States bank failures and contagion\n\nIn March 2023, a series of bank failures in the United States, including the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, sent shockwaves through the global financial system. The failures raised concerns about the stability of the banking sector and led to a crisis of confidence among investors and depositors. Credit Suisse, already weakened by its past struggles, found itself at the center of the storm, with its share price plummeting and depositors rushing to withdraw their funds.\n\n#Negotiations\n\nAs the crisis deepened, the Swiss government and financial regulators intervened to stabilize the situation. UBS, Switzerland's largest bank, was approached by regulators to explore a potential merger with Credit Suisse. The negotiations, which took place over several days, were complex and involved multiple parties, including the Swiss government, the Swiss National Bank, and the Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).\n\nThe talks focused on the terms of the deal, including the sale price, the fate of Credit Suisse's employees, and the integration of the two banks' operations. UBS initially expressed concerns about the deal, citing the potential risks and costs associated with integrating Credit Suisse's troubled assets. However, after intense pressure from regulators and the government, UBS agreed to move forward with the acquisition.\n\n#Acquisition\n\nOn March 19, 2023, UBS announced that it had agreed to acquire Credit Suisse for approximately CHF 3 billion (USD 3.2 billion). The deal, which was facilitated by the Swiss government and regulators, marked the largest bank merger in history. Under the terms of the agreement, UBS would acquire Credit Suisse's assets, including its investment banking arm, its wealth management business, and its Swiss retail banking operations.\n\n##Reactions\n\nThe acquisition sparked a mixed reaction from investors, analysts, and the public. While some welcomed the deal as a necessary step to stabilize the financial system, others expressed concerns about the potential risks and costs associated with integrating Credit Suisse's troubled assets.\n\n###AT1 bonds issue\n\nOne of the most contentious issues surrounding the acquisition was the fate of Credit Suisse's Additional Tier 1 (AT1) bonds. The bonds, which were issued by Credit Suisse to raise capital, were designed to be wiped out in the event of a bank failure. However, under the terms of the acquisition, UBS agreed to assume Credit Suisse's AT1 bonds, sparking outrage among bondholders who felt that they had been misled about the risks associated with the bonds.\n\n###Sale price issue\n\nAnother issue that sparked controversy was the sale price of the acquisition. Credit Suisse's shareholders felt that the sale price of CHF 3 billion was too low, given the bank's assets and potential value. Some analysts also questioned the valuation, citing concerns about the potential risks and costs associated with integrating Credit Suisse's troubled assets.\n\n###Lawsuits\n\nIn the aftermath of the acquisition, several lawsuits were filed by bondholders, shareholders, and other parties affected by the deal. The lawsuits alleged that UBS and the Swiss government had engaged in unfair and deceptive practices in connection with the acquisition, and sought to recover damages for the losses incurred by the plaintiffs.\n\n#Impact\n\nThe acquisition of Credit Suisse by UBS had significant implications for the banking industry, the Swiss economy, and the global financial system. The deal marked a major shift in the banking landscape, with UBS emerging as one of the largest banks in the world.\n\nThe acquisition also raised questions about the future of banking and the role of regulators in stabilizing the financial system. While some praised the deal as a necessary step to restore confidence in the banking sector, others expressed concerns about the potential risks and costs associated with integrating Credit Suisse's troubled assets.\n\n#See also\n\n* 2007–2008 financial crisis\n* Credit Suisse\n* UBS\n* Swiss National Bank\n* Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA)\n* Bank merger\n* Banking regulation\n* Financial stability", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Acquisition_of_Credit_Suisse_by_UBS\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Credit Suisse and the 2007–2008 financial crisis\n##Losses in investment banking arm\n##March 2023 United States bank failures and contagion\n#Negotiations\n#Acquisition\n##Reactions\n###AT1 bonds issue\n###Sale price issue\n###Lawsuits\n#Impact\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The team has been a member of FIFA since 1937 and has competed in numerous international tournaments, including the FIFA World Cup, the AFC Asian Cup, and the Olympic Games.\n\n# History\n\n## From 1936 to 1969: The beginnings\n\nSyria played its first international match in 1936, against Lebanon, and went on to compete in several regional tournaments, including the Arab Games and the Mediterranean Games. During this period, the team was largely composed of amateur players, and its performances were not particularly notable.\n\n## 1970s: Successes in Arab competitions\n\nThe 1970s saw an improvement in Syrian football, with the team winning several regional tournaments, including the Arab Games in 1976 and the Palestine Cup of Nations in 1973. These successes were largely due to the emergence of talented players such as Abdul Kader Kardaghli and Ahmed Khlifa.\n\n## The years 1980-1996: an improvement in Syrian football\n\nThe 1980s and 1990s saw a significant improvement in Syrian football, with the team qualifying for its first major tournament, the 1980 AFC Asian Cup. Although the team was eliminated in the group stage, it went on to compete in several other tournaments, including the 1984 Olympic Games and the 1996 AFC Asian Cup.\n\n## From 1996 to 2007: Years of hope and disappointment\n\nThe late 1990s and early 2000s saw a decline in Syrian football, with the team failing to qualify for several major tournaments. However, the team showed signs of improvement in 2004, when it reached the final of the WAFF Championship, where it lost to Iran.\n\n## From 2007 to 2012: Great achievements\n\nThe mid-2000s saw a resurgence in Syrian football, with the team qualifying for the 2007 AFC Asian Cup and reaching the quarterfinals, where it lost to South Korea. The team also competed in the 2011 AFC Asian Cup, where it was eliminated in the group stage.\n\n## From 2013 to 2016: Withdrawal from positions\n\nThe team's performances declined in the mid-2010s, with Syria failing to qualify for the 2014 FIFA World Cup and the 2015 AFC Asian Cup. The team also withdrew from the 2016 WAFF Championship due to the ongoing Syrian Civil War.\n\n## 2018 World Cup qualifiers: Syria close to great success\n\nSyria's campaign in the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers was marked by a remarkable turnaround. After losing its first four matches, the team went on to win five of its next six matches, including a 2-2 draw against Australia. Although the team ultimately failed to qualify for the World Cup, its performances were widely praised.\n\n### Syria v Australia\n\nThe match between Syria and Australia on October 10, 2017, was a crucial one for both teams. Syria needed to win to keep its hopes of qualifying for the World Cup alive, while Australia needed to win to secure its place in the playoffs. The match ended in a 2-2 draw, with Syria's Omar Khribin scoring a late equalizer.\n\n## 2019 Asian Cup: a missed opportunity\n\nSyria's campaign in the 2019 AFC Asian Cup was marked by disappointment. Despite being drawn in a relatively easy group, the team failed to win any of its matches, including a 2-0 loss to Jordan and a 2-0 loss to Australia.\n\n## From 2019 to the present\n\nThe team's performances have been inconsistent since the 2019 Asian Cup. However, Syria has shown signs of improvement in recent matches, including a 1-0 win over Uzbekistan in the 2023 AFC Asian Cup qualifiers.\n\n### 2023 AFC Asian Cup: Syria reach the knockout stage for the first time ever\n\nSyria's campaign in the 2023 AFC Asian Cup was marked by a historic achievement. The team reached the knockout stage for the first time ever, where it lost to South Korea in the round of 16.\n\n# Stadiums\n\nSyria's national team plays its home matches at the Aleppo International Stadium, which has a capacity of 53,200. The team has also played matches at other stadiums, including the Abbasiyyin Stadium in Damascus and the Hama Municipal Stadium.\n\n# Team image\n\n## Rivalries\n\n### Syria vs. Lebanon\n\nThe match between Syria and Lebanon is a highly anticipated one, with both teams having a long and complex history. The two teams have competed in numerous regional tournaments, including the Arab Games and the Mediterranean Games.\n\n### Syria vs. Jordan\n\nThe match between Syria and Jordan is another highly anticipated one, with both teams having a strong rivalry. The two teams have competed in numerous regional tournaments, including the WAFF Championship and the Arab Games.\n\n## Nickname\n\nSyria's national team is nicknamed \"The Eagles of the Levant\".\n\n## Kits\n\nSyria's national team wears a red shirt with white shorts and red socks. The team's away kit is a white shirt with red shorts and white socks.\n\n# Results and fixtures\n\n## 2023\n\n* January 20: Syria 1-0 Uzbekistan (2023 AFC Asian Cup qualifiers)\n* March 20: Syria 2-1
