The season was characterized by a relatively slow start, followed by a period of increased activity in the late summer and early fall.\n\n# Seasonal forecasts\n\n## Pre-season forecasts\n\nPrior to the start of the season, several organizations issued forecasts predicting the number of named storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes (Category 3 or higher) that would form in the Atlantic Basin. These forecasts were based on a variety of factors, including climate trends, ocean temperatures, and atmospheric conditions.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) issued its initial forecast on May 24, 2022, predicting a near-average season with 14 named storms, 7 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes. Other organizations, such as Colorado State University (CSU) and the Weather Research Center, also issued forecasts predicting a near-average to slightly above-average season.\n\n## Mid-season forecasts\n\nAs the season progressed, forecasters updated their predictions based on observed conditions. In early August, NOAA updated its forecast to 14 named storms, 7 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes, citing a slightly increased chance of a La Niña event, which would favor hurricane activity. CSU also updated its forecast, predicting 18 named storms, 8 hurricanes, and 4 major hurricanes.\n\n# Seasonal summary\n\n## Background\n\nThe 2022 Atlantic hurricane season was influenced by several climate factors, including a neutral El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) state, a slightly above-average sea surface temperature in the Main Development Region (MDR), and a strong subtropical high-pressure belt.

He rose to prominence as a prominent figure in Argentine libertarian and conservative circles, known for his outspoken views on economics and politics.\n\n#Early life and education\n\nMilei was born on October 12, 1970, in Buenos Aires, Argentina. He grew up in a middle-class family and developed an interest in economics and politics at an early age. He pursued his undergraduate studies in economics at the University of Buenos Aires and later earned a master's degree in economics from the same institution.\n\n#Economics career\n\nMilei began his career as an economist in the private sector, working for several prominent consulting firms and banks. He later transitioned to academia, teaching economics at various universities in Argentina. In the early 2000s, he became a prominent commentator on economic issues in the Argentine media, appearing regularly on television and radio programs.\n\n#Early political career\n\n##Rise to prominence\n\nMilei's entry into politics was marked by his involvement in libertarian and conservative circles in Argentina. He became a prominent figure in the Argentine Libertarian Party and began to build a reputation as a vocal advocate for free market economics and limited government intervention. In the mid-2010s, he started to gain national attention for his outspoken views on economic policy and his criticism of the government's handling of the economy.\n\n##2021 legislative campaign\n\nIn 2021, Milei ran for a seat in the Argentine Chamber of Deputies as part of the Libertarian Party's ticket. Although he did not win the election, his campaign drew significant attention and helped to establish him as a rising star in Argentine politics.\n\n#National deputyship\n\nIn 2022, Milei was elected to the Argentine Chamber of Deputies as part of the Libertarian Party's delegation. During his time in Congress, he became known for his outspoken views on economic policy and his criticism of the government's handling of the economy.\n\n#2023 Argentine general election\n\n##2023 presidential campaign\n\nIn 2023, Milei announced his candidacy for the presidency of Argentina, running as the nominee of the Libertarian Party. His campaign focused on themes of economic reform, limited government intervention, and personal freedom. Milei's campaign drew significant attention and support from voters who were disillusioned with the traditional parties and seeking a new direction for the country.\n\n##Primary and general elections\n\nMilei won the primary election with a significant margin, and went on to contest the general election against the candidate of the incumbent party. In a surprise upset, Milei won the general election with a narrow margin, becoming the first libertarian candidate to be elected president of Argentina.\n\n#Presidency (2023–present)\n\n##Inauguration\n\nMilei was inaugurated as President of Argentina on December 10, 2023, in a ceremony attended by dignitaries from across the country and around the world. In his inaugural address, he outlined his vision for the country's future, emphasizing the need for economic reform, limited government intervention, and personal freedom.\n\n##First acts\n\nMilei's first acts as president included the appointment of a new cabinet and the announcement of a series of economic reforms aimed at stimulating growth and reducing inflation. He also announced plans to reduce the size of the government and to increase transparency and accountability in the public sector.\n\n##Economy\n\nMilei's economic policies have been a major focus of his presidency. He has implemented a series of reforms aimed at stimulating growth and reducing inflation, including the reduction of taxes and regulations, and the promotion of foreign investment. He has also announced plans to reduce the country's dependence on foreign aid and to increase its exports.\n\n#Political positions\n\nMilei is a self-described libertarian and has been a vocal advocate for free market economics and limited government intervention. He has been critical of the traditional parties and has argued that they have failed to address the country's economic and social problems. He has also been a strong advocate for personal freedom and has argued that individuals should be free to make their own choices and decisions.\n\n#Public image\n\nMilei's public image is that of a charismatic and outspoken leader who is not afraid to challenge the status quo. He has been praised for his honesty and integrity, and has been criticized for his outspoken views and his willingness to challenge the traditional parties.\n\n#Personal life\n\nMilei is married and has two children.

{"title": "Indeterminacy_debate_in_legal_theory", "content": "#See also\n#Bibliography\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Indeterminacy Debate in Legal Theory\n\nThe indeterminacy debate in legal theory is a longstanding controversy surrounding the nature of law and its relationship to language, interpretation, and meaning. At its core, the debate centers on the question of whether the law is inherently indeterminate, or whether it can be understood and applied in a clear and predictable manner. This debate has significant implications for the practice of law, the role of judges and lawyers, and the broader social and political context in which law operates.\n\n# The Context of the Debate\n\n## The Rise of Formalism\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the dominant approach to law was formalism, which held that law was a coherent, rational, and systematic body of rules and principles that could be applied in a mechanical and predictable manner. Formalists argued that the meaning of the law was clear and determinate, and that judges and lawyers simply needed to apply the relevant rules and principles to reach a decision.\n\n## The Critique of Formalism\n\nHowever, in the mid-20th century, a number of scholars began to challenge the formalist approach, arguing that it was based on an overly simplistic and unrealistic view of law and language. Critics argued that the meaning of the law was not always clear and determinate, but was instead subject to multiple interpretations and uncertainties. This critique of formalism laid the groundwork for the indeterminacy debate.\n\n# The Indeterminacy Thesis\n\n## The Core Argument\n\nThe indeterminacy thesis argues that the law is inherently indeterminate, meaning that its meaning and application cannot be reduced to a clear and predictable set of rules and principles. Proponents of this view argue that the language of the law is inherently ambiguous and open-ended, and that judges and lawyers must therefore rely on discretion and interpretation to reach a decision.\n\n## The Role of Language\n\nAccording to the indeterminacy thesis, language plays a central role in the creation and interpretation of law. The meaning of a legal text is not fixed or determinate, but is instead subject to multiple interpretations and reinterpretations. This means that judges and lawyers must engage in a process of interpretation, using their own discretion and judgment to determine the meaning and application of the law.\n\n## The Implications of Indeterminacy\n\nThe indeterminacy thesis has significant implications for the practice of law and the role of judges and lawyers. If the law is inherently indeterminate, then judges and lawyers must be given a degree of discretion and flexibility to interpret and apply the law. This means that the law is not a fixed and unchanging body of rules and principles, but is instead a dynamic and evolving system that is shaped by the interactions and decisions of judges, lawyers, and other legal actors.\n\n# Challenges to the Indeterminacy Thesis\n\n## The Argument from Clarity\n\nOne challenge to the indeterminacy thesis is the argument from clarity, which holds that many areas of the law are clear and determinate, and that judges and lawyers can apply the relevant rules and principles in a predictable and mechanical manner. Proponents of this view argue that the indeterminacy thesis overstates the degree of uncertainty and ambiguity in the law, and that many areas of the law are subject to clear and determinate rules and principles.\n\n## The Argument from Constraint\n\nAnother challenge to the indeterminacy thesis is the argument from constraint, which holds that judges and lawyers are subject to a range of constraints and limitations that limit their discretion and flexibility. Proponents of this view argue that judges and lawyers are bound by a range of rules, principles, and precedents that limit their ability to interpret and apply the law in a completely discretionary manner.\n\n## The Argument from Coherence\n\nA final challenge to the indeterminacy thesis is the argument from coherence, which holds that the law is a coherent and rational system that is guided by a set of underlying principles and values. Proponents of this view argue that the indeterminacy thesis underestimates the degree of coherence and rationality in the law, and that judges and lawyers can apply the relevant rules and principles in a way that is consistent with the underlying principles and values of the law.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe indeterminacy debate in legal theory is a complex and multifaceted controversy that has significant implications for the practice of law and the role of judges and lawyers. While proponents of the indeterminacy thesis argue that the law is inherently indeterminate and subject to multiple interpretations and uncertainties, critics argue that the law is clear and determinate, or that judges and lawyers are subject to a range of constraints and limitations that limit their discretion and flexibility. Ultimately, the indeterminacy debate highlights the complexity and nuance of the law, and the need for ongoing reflection and debate about the nature of law and its relationship to language, interpretation, and meaning.\n\n# See also\n\n* Formalism (law)\n* Interpretivism (law)\n* Legal realism\n* Rule of law\n\n# Bibliography\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as the article does not include any citations or references.)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Indeterminacy_debate_in_legal_theory\" following this outline:\n\n#See also\n#Bibliography\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

From its humble beginnings as a necessary form of transportation and survival to its current status as a global recreational activity, rock climbing has evolved over time, shaped by advances in technology, changes in societal values, and the contributions of pioneers and innovators. This article will explore the history of rock climbing, from its ancient origins to the present day.\n\n#Origins\n\nRock climbing has its roots in ancient civilizations, where people would climb mountains and rocks for various reasons such as hunting, gathering, and spiritual or ceremonial purposes. Evidence of ancient rock climbing can be found in various parts of the world, including the mountains of Greece, the Himalayas, and the American Southwest. In these early times, climbing was not a recreational activity but a necessary means of survival, and people used simple techniques and tools such as ladders, ropes, and pitons to ascend and descend.\n\n##Early Climbing Techniques\n\nEarly climbers used a variety of techniques to ascend and descend rocks, including free climbing, aid climbing, and rappelling. Free climbing involved climbing without the use of any equipment or aid, relying solely on one's strength, agility, and technique. Aid climbing, on the other hand, involved using equipment such as ropes, pitons, and ladders to assist in the ascent. Rappelling, or descending by rope, was also used to quickly and safely descend steep terrain.\n\n#19th century\n\nDuring the 19th century, rock climbing began to take on a more recreational form, particularly in Europe and North America. The Industrial Revolution had brought about significant changes in society, and people began to have more leisure time, which they used to pursue outdoor activities such as hiking, mountaineering, and rock climbing.\n\n##The Golden Age of Alpinism\n\nThe mid-19th century is often referred to as the \"Golden Age of Alpinism.\" During this time, climbers such as Albert Smith and John Tyndall made significant ascents in the Alps, using techniques such as the \"alpine style,\" which emphasized speed, efficiency, and minimal use of equipment. This period also saw the establishment of the Alpine Club, one of the first mountaineering clubs in the world.\n\n#1900s\n\nThe early 20th century saw significant advances in rock climbing technology, particularly in the development of equipment such as ropes, harnesses, and carabiners. This period also saw the rise of climbing clubs and organizations, such as the Sierra Club and the Mountaineers, which helped to promote and organize climbing activities.\n\n##The Development of New Techniques\n\nThe early 20th century also saw the development of new climbing techniques, such as the use of pitons and expansion bolts. Pitons, small metal spikes that were hammered into the rock, allowed climbers to ascend steeper and more difficult terrain. Expansion bolts, which were used to anchor ropes to the rock, provided a safer and more reliable means of protection.\n\n#1910s\n\nThe 1910s saw a significant increase in climbing activity, particularly in the United States and Europe. This period also saw the establishment of the first climbing competitions, such as the \"Mountain Climbing Competition\" held in the Swiss Alps in 1912.\n\n##The Rise of Sport Climbing\n\nThe 1910s also saw the rise of sport climbing, which emphasized the use of specialized equipment and techniques to ascend difficult and exposed terrain. Sport climbers such as Emilio Comici and Riccardo Cassin made significant ascents in the Dolomites and other European ranges.\n\n#1920s\n\nThe 1920s saw significant advances in climbing technology, particularly in the development of new materials and equipment such as nylon ropes and aluminum carabiners. This period also saw the establishment of the first climbing magazines, such as the \"Alpine Journal\" and \"Appalachia.\"\n\n##The Golden Age of American Climbing\n\nThe 1920s are often referred to as the \"Golden Age of American Climbing.\" During this time, climbers such as Norman Clyde and Jules Eichorn made significant ascents in the Sierra Nevada and other American ranges.\n\n#1930s\n\nThe 1930s saw significant advances in climbing technique, particularly in the development of new styles such as \"big wall\" climbing and \"free solo\" climbing. This period also saw the establishment of the first climbing schools and guide services.\n\n##The Development of Big Wall Climbing\n\nThe 1930s saw the development of big wall climbing, which involved ascending large, vertical walls using specialized equipment and techniques. Climbers such as Walter Bonatti and Riccardo Cassin made significant ascents on big walls in the Dolomites and other European ranges.\n\n#1940s\n\nThe 1940s saw significant advances in climbing technology, particularly in the development of new materials and equipment such as nylon ropes and aluminum carabiners. This period also saw the establishment of the first climbing competitions, such as the \"International Climbing Competition\" held in the Swiss Alps in 1948.\n\n##The Rise of Competition Climbing\n\nThe 1940s saw the rise of competition climbing, which emphasized speed and efficiency in ascending difficult terrain. Climbers such as Emilio Comici and Riccardo Cassin competed in events such as the \"International Climbing Competition\" and the \"European Climbing Championships.\"\n\n#1950s\n\nThe 1950s saw significant advances in climbing technique, particularly in the development of new styles such as \"free climbing\" and \"aid climbing.\" This period also saw the establishment of the first climbing clubs and organizations, such as the \"American Alpine Club\" and the \"International Federation of Mountain Guides Associations.\"\n\n##The Development of Free Climbing\n\nThe 1950s saw the development of free climbing, which emphasized the use of natural holds and features to ascend difficult terrain without the use of equipment or aid. Climbers such as John Salathé and Royal Robbins made significant free climbs in the Sierra Nevada and other American ranges.\n\n#1960s\n\nThe 1960s saw significant advances in climbing technology, particularly in the development of new materials and equipment such as nylon ropes and aluminum carabiners. This period also saw the establishment of the first climbing competitions, such as the \"International Climbing Competition\" held in the Swiss Alps in 1962.\n\n##The Rise of Counterculture Climbing\n\nThe 1960s saw the rise of counterculture climbing, which emphasized a more relaxed and casual approach to climbing. Climbers such as Yvon Chouinard and Dougal Haston made significant ascents in the Sierra Nevada and other American ranges.\n\n#1970s\n\nThe 1970s saw significant advances in climbing technique, particularly in the development of new styles such as \"free solo\" climbing and \"ice climbing.\" This period also saw the establishment of the first climbing schools and guide services.\n\n##The Development of Free Solo Climbing\n\nThe 1970s saw the development of free solo climbing, which emphasized the use of natural holds and features to ascend difficult terrain without the use of equipment or aid.

The season premiered on March 9, 2023, and concluded on May 11, 2023. The show was hosted by Arisa Cox and featured a diverse cast of 16 HouseGuests competing for a grand prize of $100,000.\n\nFormat\n-------\n\nThe format of Big Brother Canada Season 11 remained largely the same as previous seasons. A group of 16 HouseGuests from different backgrounds and regions of Canada entered the Big Brother Canada house, where they lived together under 24/7 surveillance. Each week, one HouseGuest was voted out of the house by their fellow competitors, with the last person standing winning the grand prize.\n\nHouseGuests\n------------\n\nThe 16 HouseGuests competing in Season 11 were:\n\n* Adam Pike, a 27-year-old bartender from Nova Scotia\n* Alejandra Martinez, a 24-year-old event planner from Ontario\n* Anthony Douglas, a 28-year-old personal trainer from British Columbia\n* Christopher Diamond, a 30-year-old marketing manager from Quebec\n* Claudia Campbell, a 25-year-old nurse from Alberta\n* Daniel Clarke, a 26-year-old teacher from Manitoba\n* Emily Hawkin, a 22-year-old student from Prince Edward Island\n* Hope Agnelli, a 29-year-old lawyer from Ontario\n* Jessica Platt, a 28-year-old police officer from Saskatchewan\n* John Michael Sosa, a 27-year-old entrepreneur from British Columbia\n* Kevin Jacobs, a 29-year-old engineer from Nova Scotia\n* Laura Tirabassi, a 26-year-old artist from Quebec\n* Matthew Clarke, a 24-year-old bartender from Ontario\n* Samantha Picco, a 30-year-old journalist from Newfoundland and Labrador\n* Ty McDonald, a 27-year-old firefighter from Alberta\n\nFuture appearances\n-----------------\n\nSeveral HouseGuests from Season 11 have gone on to appear in other reality television shows and media outlets. Adam Pike and Alejandra Martinez both competed in the 2023 season of Ex on the Beach Canada, while Anthony Douglas appeared as a contestant on the 2023 season of The Challenge.\n\nSummary\n--------\n\nThe season began with 16 HouseGuests entering the Big Brother Canada house, where they were immediately put to the test with a series of physical and mental challenges. Throughout the season, alliances were formed and broken, and several HouseGuests found themselves on the block multiple times.\n\nThe season was marked by several twists and turns, including the introduction of a new twist called \"Dead Last Nomination,\" which gave the last-place finisher in a competition the power to nominate a HouseGuest for eviction. Another twist, \"Belairdirect Eviction Protection Insurance,\" allowed HouseGuests to earn protection from eviction by completing certain tasks.\n\nEpisodes\n---------\n\nThe season consisted of 30 episodes, which aired from March 9 to May 11, 2023. Each episode featured a different challenge or competition, as well as the nomination and eviction process.\n\nTwists\n------\n\nSeveral twists were introduced throughout the season, including:\n\n### Dead Last Nomination\n\nThe \"Dead Last Nomination\" twist gave the last-place finisher in a competition the power to nominate a HouseGuest for eviction. This twist was introduced in Week 3 and was used several times throughout the season.\n\n### Belairdirect Eviction Protection Insurance\n\nThe \"Belairdirect Eviction Protection Insurance\" twist allowed HouseGuests to earn protection from eviction by completing certain tasks. This twist was introduced in Week 5 and was used several times throughout the season.\n\n### Wendy's Rewards Points\n\nThe \"Wendy's Rewards Points\" twist gave HouseGuests the opportunity to earn rewards points by completing certain tasks. These points could be redeemed for prizes and privileges in the house.\n\n### Whodunit Week\n\n\"Whodunit Week\" was a twist that took place in Week 7, where HouseGuests had to solve a mystery to win a reward.\n\n### Fatal Feast\n\nThe \"Fatal Feast\" twist took place in Week 9, where HouseGuests had to eat a series of disgusting foods to win a reward.\n\n### Other twists\n\nSeveral other twists were introduced throughout the season, including a \"Power of Veto\" twist, which gave the winner of a competition the power to veto a nomination, and a \"Double Eviction\" twist, which saw two HouseGuests evicted in one night.\n\nProduction\n------------\n\n### Development\n\nThe development of Big Brother Canada Season 11 began several months before the season premiered. The show's producers worked to create a diverse and dynamic cast, as well as to develop new twists and challenges for the season.\n\n### Prizes\n\nThe grand prize for the season was $100,000, which was awarded to the last HouseGuest standing.

It is one of the oldest human technologies, dating back to the Neolithic period, around 9000 BC. Pottery has played a significant role in the development of human societies, providing essential items for daily life, such as cups, bowls, and storage vessels. Throughout history, pottery has also been used to create beautiful and intricate works of art, often reflecting the cultural and aesthetic values of the societies that produced them.\n\nMain Types\n------------\n\nPottery can be broadly classified into three main types, based on the type of clay used, the firing temperature, and the resulting properties of the material.\n\n### Earthenware\n\nEarthenware is the most common type of pottery, made from clay that contains iron oxide, which gives it a reddish-brown color. Earthenware is often fired at a relatively low temperature, around 1000°C (1832°F), which makes it more prone to water absorption and less durable than other types of pottery. However, earthenware is also more forgiving and easier to work with, making it a popular choice for beginners and hobbyists.\n\n### Stoneware\n\nStoneware is a type of pottery that is fired at a higher temperature, around 1200°C (2192°F), which makes it more durable and resistant to water absorption. Stoneware is often made from clay that contains feldspar, a type of mineral that helps to strengthen the material. Stoneware is often used to create functional items, such as cups, bowls, and plates, as well as decorative pieces.\n\n### Porcelain\n\nPorcelain is a type of pottery that is made from a specific type of clay, called kaolin, which is fired at a very high temperature, around 1400°C (2552°F). Porcelain is known for its whiteness, translucency, and strength, making it highly prized for decorative and functional items. Porcelain is often used to create intricate and delicate pieces, such as figurines, vases, and tea sets.\n\nArchaeology\n-------------\n\nPottery has played a significant role in archaeology, providing valuable insights into the lives and cultures of ancient societies. The analysis of pottery fabric, or the material composition of the pottery, can provide information about the technology, economy, and social organization of ancient societies.\n\n### Fabric Analysis\n\nFabric analysis involves the examination of the physical properties of pottery, such as its texture, color, and composition. By analyzing these properties, archaeologists can determine the type of clay used, the firing temperature, and the methods used to shape and decorate the pottery. This information can provide valuable insights into the technological and cultural developments of ancient societies.\n\nClay Bodies and Raw Materials\n-----------------------------\n\nPottery is made from clay, a type of fine-grained earth material that is rich in silicates. Clay is often mixed with other materials, such as water, sand, and minerals, to create a workable mixture. The type of clay used can affect the final properties of the pottery, such as its color, strength, and durability.\n\nProduction\n------------\n\nThe production of pottery involves several stages, including shaping, drying, firing, and decorating.\n\n### Shaping\n\nShaping involves the creation of the desired form of the pottery, using techniques such as hand-building, throwing on a potter's wheel, or slip-casting. The choice of technique depends on the type of pottery being made and the desired level of precision and control.\n\n### Drying\n\nDrying involves the removal of excess moisture from the pottery, either through air-drying or using a drying machine. This stage is critical, as it can affect the final shape and integrity of the pottery.\n\n### Firing\n\nFiring involves the exposure of the pottery to high temperatures, either in a kiln or using a raku firing technique. Firing can affect the color, strength, and durability of the pottery.\n\n#### Temperature\n\nThe firing temperature can affect the final properties of the pottery, such as its color, strength, and durability. Different types of pottery require different firing temperatures, ranging from around 1000°C (1832°F) for earthenware to around 1400°C (2552°F) for porcelain.\n\n#### Atmosphere\n\nThe firing atmosphere can also affect the final properties of the pottery, such as its color and texture. A reduction atmosphere, for example, can produce a range of colors, from pink to orange, while an oxidation atmosphere can produce a range of colors, from yellow to green.\n\n#### Methods\n\nThere are several firing methods, including electric kilns, gas kilns, and raku firing. Electric kilns are the most common type, as they provide precise control over the firing temperature and atmosphere.\n\n#### Stages\n\nFiring involves several stages, including bisque firing, glaze firing, and reduction firing. Bisque firing involves the firing of the pottery at a low temperature to remove excess moisture and create a hard, brittle surface. Glaze firing involves the application of a glaze and firing at a higher temperature to melt and set the glaze. Reduction firing involves the firing of the pottery in a reduction atmosphere to produce specific colors and textures.\n\n### Decorating\n\nDecorating involves the addition of surface decoration, such as glazes, slips, and underglaze pigments. The choice of decoration depends on the type of pottery being made and the desired level of complexity and detail.\n\n#### Methods\n\nThere are several decorating methods, including hand-painting, stenciling, and stamping. Hand-painting involves the use of brushes to apply underglaze pigments or glazes. Stenciling involves the use of stencils to apply underglaze pigments or glazes. Stamping involves the use of stamps to apply underglaze pigments or glazes.\n\nGlazing\n----------\n\nGlazing involves the application of a layer of glaze to the pottery, either by brushing, pouring, or spraying. Glaze is a mixture of chemicals that melt and form a glass-like surface when fired. Glaze can be transparent, opaque, or colored, and can be used to create a range of effects, from smooth, glossy surfaces to textured, matte surfaces.\n\nHealth and Environmental Issues\n---------------------------------\n\nPottery production can involve several health and environmental issues, including the use of toxic materials, the release of pollutants, and the disposal of waste.\n\nHistory\n---------\n\nPottery has a long and complex history, dating back to the Neolithic period, around 9000 BC. The development of pottery has been influenced by a range of factors, including technological innovations, cultural exchange, and environmental factors.\n\n### Early Pottery\n\nEarly pottery was made from clay that was fired at a low temperature, around 1000°C (1832°F). This type of pottery was often unglazed and was used for functional items, such as cups, bowls, and storage vessels.\n\n### History by Region\n\n#### Beginnings of Pottery\n\nThe beginnings of pottery are not well-documented, but it is believed that pottery was first developed in the Middle East, around 9000 BC.\n\n#### East Asia\n\nIn East Asia, pottery was first developed in China, around 8000 BC. Chinese pottery is known for its technical excellence and its use of glazes, which were first developed during the Han dynasty (206 BC-220 AD).\n\n#### South Asia\n\nIn South Asia, pottery was first developed in the Indus Valley Civilization, around 3300 BC.

The exodus was triggered by the outbreak of militancy in the region, which led to a significant escalation of violence and intimidation against the Kashmiri Hindu community.\n\n#Background\n\nThe Kashmir Valley has a long history of cultural and religious diversity, with Kashmiri Hindus and Muslims coexisting for centuries. However, the relationship between the two communities began to deteriorate in the late 20th century, particularly in the 1980s. The rise of Islamist and separatist movements in the region, which sought independence from India or merger with Pakistan, created an atmosphere of tension and hostility towards the Kashmiri Hindu community.\n\nThe Kashmiri Hindus, who were predominantly concentrated in the Kashmir Valley, began to feel increasingly vulnerable and insecure. Many of them had already migrated to other parts of India in search of better economic opportunities, but those who remained were subjected to harassment, intimidation, and violence by militant groups.\n\n#Insurgency activity\n\nThe insurgency in Kashmir, which began in the late 1980s, was led by several militant groups, including the Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) and the Hizbul Mujahideen. These groups sought to establish an independent Kashmir or merge with Pakistan, and they saw the Kashmiri Hindus as a major obstacle to achieving their goals.\n\n##Attack and threats\n\nThe Kashmiri Hindus were subjected to a series of attacks and threats by militant groups, which included killings, kidnappings, and forced conversions.

Depp denied ever physically or emotionally abusing Heard, while Heard described multiple incidents of abuse. Several other witnesses also testified, including friends and family members of both parties.\n\n#### Closing arguments\n\nDuring the closing arguments, Depp's lawyers argued that Heard's op-ed article was a clear example of defamation and that she had failed to prove that the allegations of domestic abuse were true. Heard's lawyers countered that the article was a legitimate expression of her opinions and experiences and that Depp was attempting to silence her.\n\n#### Verdict\n\nOn June 1, 2022, the jury delivered a verdict in favor of Johnny Depp. The jury found that Amber Heard had defamed Depp in three statements in her op-ed article. The jury awarded Depp $10.35 million in damages.\n\n### Post-trial motions\n\nAfter the verdict, Heard's lawyers filed a motion to set aside the verdict and order a new trial. Depp's lawyers opposed the motion, arguing that the verdict was fair and just.\n\n### Appeals, settlement and carrier lawsuit\n\nIn July 2022, Amber Heard filed an appeal against the verdict, arguing that the trial was unfair and that the jury's decision was based on faulty evidence. In September 2022, it was reported that Depp and Heard had reached a settlement, with Heard agreeing to pay Depp $1 million in damages.\n\nReactions\n----------\n\n### Livestream\n\nThe trial was livestreamed on various platforms, including YouTube and social media.

Born on June 19, 1951, in Maadi, Cairo, Egypt, al-Zawahiri was a key figure in the global jihadist movement and played a significant role in shaping the ideology and strategy of al-Qaeda.\n\n# Personal life\n\n## Early life\n\n### Youth\n\nAyman al-Zawahiri was born into a middle-class family of doctors and scholars. His father, Mohammed Rabie al-Zawahiri, was a professor of pharmacology at Cairo University, and his mother, Umayma Azzam, came from a prominent Egyptian family. Al-Zawahiri's family was known for their piety and commitment to Islamic values. He was raised in a conservative household and was educated at a local mosque.\n\n### Underground cell\n\nIn his teenage years, al-Zawahiri became involved with the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist organization that aimed to establish an Islamic state in Egypt. He was particularly drawn to the ideas of Sayyid Qutb, a prominent Brotherhood leader who advocated for the use of violence against the Egyptian government. Al-Zawahiri's involvement with the Brotherhood led to his arrest in 1966, and he spent several months in prison.\n\n## Marriages and children\n\nAl-Zawahiri married Azza Ahmed Nowari in 1978, and the couple had four daughters together. Azza was a cousin of al-Zawahiri's and shared his commitment to Islamist ideology. The couple's daughters were raised in a conservative household and received a traditional Islamic education. Al-Zawahiri's family life was marked by tragedy in 2001, when his wife and three of their daughters were killed in a US airstrike in Afghanistan.\n\n# Medical career\n\nAl-Zawahiri studied medicine at Cairo University, where he earned a degree in surgery in 1974. He later earned a master's degree in surgery from the same university in 1978. Al-Zawahiri worked as a surgeon in several hospitals in Egypt and later in Saudi Arabia. His medical career was marked by a strong commitment to providing care to the poor and marginalized.\n\n# Militant activity\n\n## Assassination plots\n\n### Egypt\n\nAl-Zawahiri was involved in several plots to assassinate Egyptian government officials, including President Anwar El-Sadat.

The disaster resulted in one of the deadliest stadium disasters in history, with numerous fatalities and injuries. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the background, disaster, aftermath, and reactions to the tragedy.\n\n#Background\n\nThe Kanjuruhan Stadium was a multi-purpose stadium located in Malang, East Java, Indonesia. The stadium had a capacity of around 38,000 spectators and was primarily used for football matches. On October 1, 2022, the stadium was hosting a match between Arema FC and Persebaya Surabaya, two prominent football clubs in Indonesia. The match was part of the 2022-2023 Liga 1 season, the top-tier football league in Indonesia.\n\n#Disaster\n\nThe disaster occurred when a large number of spectators, mostly supporters of the home team Arema FC, stormed the pitch after the match ended in a 3-2 defeat for Arema. The fans were dissatisfied with the result and began throwing objects and vandalizing the stadium. The situation quickly escalated, and the police responded by firing tear gas into the crowd. The tear gas caused panic, leading to a stampede among the spectators.\n\n#Casualties\n\nThe disaster resulted in a significant number of casualties, with many spectators sustaining injuries or fatalities. The exact number of fatalities and injuries varied depending on the source, but it is estimated that at least 135 people died, with many more injured.\n\n##Ages and genders\n\nThe victims of the disaster included people of various ages and genders.

The majority of the victims were male, but some female spectators also lost their lives.\n\n#Aftermath\n\nThe aftermath of the disaster was marked by widespread shock and grief. The Indonesian government declared a national day of mourning, and many football clubs and organizations around the world offered condolences to the victims and their families. The stadium was closed for investigation, and the football league was suspended indefinitely.\n\n#Legal\n\nThe legal response to the disaster was swift, with the Indonesian police launching an investigation into the incident. Several police officers were suspended, and the head of the Malang police department was removed from his position. The government also established a fact-finding team to investigate the causes of the disaster.\n\n#Investigation\n\nThe investigation into the disaster was led by the Indonesian police, with assistance from other government agencies.\n\n##Police\n\nThe police investigation focused on the actions of the police officers who responded to the incident.

All 150 seats in the Texas House of Representatives were up for election.\n\n# Background\n\nThe 2022 Texas House of Representatives election was the first election to be held after the 2020 United States Census. The Texas Legislature had been redistricted, which resulted in changes to the boundaries of several districts. The election was also notable for being the first election to be held under new voting laws, which had been passed by the Texas Legislature in 2021.\n\n# Redistricting\n\nThe 2020 United States Census resulted in Texas gaining two new congressional seats, which meant that the state's electoral districts had to be redrawn. The Texas Legislature was responsible for redrawing the district boundaries. The new district boundaries were approved in October 2021.\n\n## Seats without incumbents\n\nSeveral seats were without incumbents due to redistricting. Some districts had been eliminated, while others had been created.

The rebellion was a culmination of tensions between gold miners and the colonial authorities, which ultimately led to a confrontation between the two groups. The event has become a symbol of Australian democracy and a testament to the power of collective action.\n\nOrigins in the Victorian gold rush\n\nProtests on the goldfields: 1851–1854\n\nLa Trobe introduces monthly mining tax as protests begin\n\nIn 1851, the Victorian government, under the leadership of Governor Charles La Trobe, introduced a monthly mining tax of 30 shillings per miner. The tax was intended to regulate the rapidly growing gold mining industry, but it was met with widespread resistance from the miners. The tax was seen as excessive and unfair, particularly given the harsh conditions and risks associated with gold mining.\n\nFirst gold commissioner arrives in Ballarat\n\nIn 1852, the first gold commissioner, William Wright, arrived in Ballarat. Wright was tasked with enforcing the mining tax and maintaining order on the goldfields. However, his approach was heavy-handed, and he quickly became unpopular among the miners.\n\nBendigo Petition and the Red Ribbon Movement\n\nIn 1853, a group of miners in Bendigo, a nearby goldfield, presented a petition to the government calling for the abolition of the mining tax. The petition was signed by over 23,000 miners and became known as the Bendigo Petition. The petition sparked a wave of protests and demonstrations across the goldfields, with miners wearing red ribbons as a symbol of solidarity.\n\nLegislative Council calls for Commission of Inquiry\n\nIn response to the growing unrest, the Legislative Council called for a Commission of Inquiry to investigate the grievances of the miners. However, the commission's report, which was published in 1854, was seen as inadequate and failed to address the underlying issues.\n\nHotham replaces La Trobe\n\nIn 1854, Sir Charles Hotham replaced La Trobe as Governor of Victoria. Hotham was a military officer with a reputation for being firm but fair. However, he was also seen as being out of touch with the needs and concerns of the miners.\n\nTensions escalate\n\nMurder of James Scobie and the burning of the Eureka hotel\n\nOn October 6, 1854, a miner named James Scobie was murdered outside the Eureka Hotel in Ballarat. The hotel was owned by James Bentley, a notorious entrepreneur who had connections to the government. The murder sparked widespread outrage, and a group of miners burned down the hotel in response.\n\nBallarat Reform League meetings\n\nIn the aftermath of the hotel burning, a group of miners formed the Ballarat Reform League. The league was dedicated to promoting the rights and interests of the miners and pushing for reforms. The league's meetings were attended by thousands of miners, and they became a focal point for the growing unrest.\n\nEscalating violence as military convoy looted\n\nIn late November 1854, a military convoy carrying gold and supplies was looted by a group of miners. The incident sparked a wave of violence and intimidation, with both sides engaging in tit-for-tat attacks.\n\nOpen rebellion\n\nParamilitary mobilisation and swearing allegiance to the Southern Cross\n\nIn response to the escalating violence, a group of miners formed a paramilitary organization known as the Ballarat Reform League Militia. The militia was led by Peter Lalor, a charismatic Irish-born miner who would become a key figure in the rebellion. On November 29, 1854, the militia gathered on Bakery Hill, where they swore allegiance to the Southern Cross, a symbol of the rebellion.\n\nFortification of the Eureka lead\n\nIn the days leading up to the rebellion, the miners fortified the Eureka lead, a strategic location that controlled access to the goldfields. The fortification was a makeshift stockade made of wooden palisades and earthworks.\n\nVinegar Hill blunder: Irish dimension factors in dwindling numbers at stockade\n\nOn the eve of the rebellion, a group of Irish miners, who were sympathetic to the cause, were mistakenly arrested by the authorities. The incident, known as the Vinegar Hill blunder, led to a significant decline in the number of miners who gathered at the stockade.\n\nDeparting detachment of Independent Californian Rangers leaves small garrison behind\n\nOn the morning of December 3, 1854, a detachment of the Independent Californian Rangers, a group of American miners who had been hired by the government, departed the stockade, leaving behind a small garrison of around 150 miners.\n\nBattle of the Eureka Stockade\n\nThe battle of the Eureka Stockade was a brief but intense confrontation between the miners and the authorities. The battle began at dawn on December 3, 1854, when a group of police and military officers, led by Captain John Thomas, attacked the stockade. The miners, who were vastly outnumbered and outgunned, put up a fierce resistance, but they were ultimately overwhelmed. The battle lasted for around 30 minutes, and when it was over, 22 miners lay dead, and many more were wounded.\n\nAftermath\n\nTrials for sedition and high treason\n\nIn the aftermath of the rebellion, the authorities arrested and charged 13 miners with sedition and high treason. The trials were widely seen as a sham, and the miners were eventually acquitted.\n\nCommission of Inquiry report\n\nIn 1855, the government established a Commission of Inquiry to investigate the rebellion. The commission's report, which was published in 1856, was critical of the government's handling of the crisis and recommended significant reforms.\n\nPeter Lalor enters parliament\n\nIn 1856, Peter Lalor, the leader of the rebellion, was elected to the Victorian parliament. Lalor would go on to become a prominent figure in Australian politics, serving as a minister and eventually as the speaker of the house.\n\nLocation of Bakery Hill and the Eureka Stockade\n\nThe site of the Eureka Stockade is located in Ballarat, Victoria, on a hill overlooking the goldfields. The site is now a museum and a memorial to the miners who lost their lives in the rebellion.\n\nPolitical legacy\n\nThe Eureka Rebellion had a profound impact on Australian politics and society. The rebellion marked a turning point in the struggle for democracy and workers' rights in Australia. The rebellion also led to significant reforms, including the establishment of the Victorian parliament and the introduction of the secret ballot.\n\nCommemoration\n\n19th century\n\nIn the years following the rebellion, the Eureka Stockade was commemorated with a series of monuments and memorials. In 1856, a monument was erected on the site of the stockade, and in 1889, a statue of Peter Lalor was unveiled in Ballarat.\n\n20th century\n\nIn the 20th century, the Eureka Stockade was commemorated with a series of events and exhibitions. In 1954, a centenary celebration was held in Ballarat, and in 1984, a museum was established on the site of the stockade.\n\n21st century\n\nIn the 21st century, the Eureka Stockade continues to be commemorated with a series of events and exhibitions. In 2004, a 150th-anniversary celebration was held in Ballarat, and in 2019, a new museum was opened on the site of the stockade.\n\nPopular culture\n\nThe Eureka Stockade has been immortalized in popular culture, with numerous books, films, and songs written about the rebellion. The rebellion has also been the subject of several plays and musicals.\n\nSee also\n\n* Australian gold rushes\n* Ballarat Reform League\n* Peter Lalor\n* Victorian parliament\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Eureka_Rebellion\" following this outline:\n\n#Origins in the Victorian gold rush\n##Protests on the goldfields: 1851–1854\n###La Trobe introduces monthly mining tax as protests begin\n###First gold commissioner arrives in Ballarat\n###Bendigo Petition and the Red Ribbon Movement\n###Legislative Council calls for Commission of Inquiry\n###Hotham replaces La Trobe\n#Tensions escalate\n##Murder of James Scobie and the burning of the Eureka hotel\n##Ballarat Reform League meetings\n##Escalating violence as military convoy looted\n#Open rebellion\n##Paramilitary mobilisation and swearing allegiance to the Southern Cross\n###Fortification of the Eureka lead\n####Vinegar Hill blunder: Irish dimension factors in dwindling numbers at stockade\n####Departing detachment of Independent Californian Rangers leaves small garrison behind\n##Battle of the Eureka Stockade\n#Aftermath\n##Trials for sedition and high treason\n##Commission of Inquiry report\n##Peter Lalor enters parliament\n#Location of Bakery Hill and the Eureka Stockade\n#Political legacy\n#Commemoration\n##19th century\n##20th century\n##21st century\n#Popular culture\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The album marked the band's first studio release in eight years, following the departure of drummer Martin Kearns and the inclusion of new drummer Martin van Drunen.\n\nBackground and recording\n------------------------\n\nFollowing the release of their previous album, Honour - Valour - Pride, in 2001, Bolt Thrower began working on new material. However, the band's progress was hindered by the departure of drummer Martin Kearns, who left the band in 2003 due to health issues. After a brief period of inactivity, Bolt Thrower recruited Martin van Drunen, formerly of Pestilence and Asphyx, to take over drumming duties. With the new lineup in place, the band began working on Those Once Loyal in earnest.\n\nThe album was recorded at Sable Rose Studios in Coventry, England, with producer Andy Faulkner. Bolt Thrower's guitarist, Gavin Ward, noted that the recording process was more relaxed than previous efforts, with the band taking the time to experiment with new ideas and approaches. Van Drunen's inclusion also brought a fresh perspective to the band's sound, with Ward praising his new bandmate's technical proficiency and versatility.\n\nComposition\n------------\n\n### Music\n\nThose Once Loyal features a distinct shift in Bolt Thrower's sound, with a greater emphasis on melody and atmosphere. The album's music is characterized by slow, heavy riffs and a prominent use of harmonies, creating a dense and layered sound. Ward's guitar work is particularly noteworthy, with intricate arrangements and a focus on texture and mood. Van Drunen's drumming also adds a new dimension to the band's sound, with a greater emphasis on precision and technicality.\n\nThe album's music is also notable for its use of dynamics, with quiet, introspective moments juxtaposed with heavy, driving sections. This approach creates a sense of tension and release, adding depth and complexity to the music. Bolt Thrower's bassist, Jo Bench, also plays a crucial role in the album's sound, providing a solid foundation and underscoring the band's heavy, plodding rhythms.\n\n### Lyrics\n\nThose Once Loyal's lyrics are written by Bolt Thrower's vocalist, Karl Willetts, and explore themes of war, mortality, and the human condition. Willetts' lyrics are characteristically dark and introspective, with a focus on the personal and emotional costs of conflict. The album's title, Those Once Loyal, refers to the idea of loyalty and duty in the face of adversity, and the ways in which these values can be tested and compromised.\n\nWilletts' lyrics are also notable for their use of imagery and metaphor, creating vivid and powerful descriptions of war and its aftermath. The album's lyrics are often abstract and open to interpretation, adding a layer of complexity and depth to the music.\n\n### Title and artwork\n\nThe album's title, Those Once Loyal, is taken from a poem by Wilfred Owen, a British poet who served in World War I. The poem, \"The Parable of the Old Man and the Young\", explores the themes of loyalty, duty, and the human cost of war. The album's artwork, designed by Bolt Thrower's longtime collaborator, Andy Faulkner, features a haunting image of a soldier's helmet, surrounded by barbed wire and poppies. The image is a powerful symbol of the album's themes, and serves as a striking visual representation of the music.\n\nRelease\n--------\n\n### Promotion\n\nThose Once Loyal was promoted through a series of live shows and festival appearances, including a headlining slot at the 2005 edition of the Maryland Deathfest. The album's release was also accompanied by a press campaign, with interviews and reviews appearing in a range of metal and music publications.\n\n### Those Still Loyal Tour\n\nIn support of the album, Bolt Thrower embarked on the Those Still Loyal Tour, a European trek that took the band to a range of cities and venues. The tour featured a mix of festival appearances and headlining shows, with Bolt Thrower sharing the stage with a range of other metal bands. The tour was a success, with Bolt Thrower delivering powerful and intense performances to enthusiastic audiences.\n\nReception\n----------\n\n### Contemporaneous reviews\n\nThose Once Loyal received widespread critical acclaim upon its release, with many reviewers praising the album's heavy, driving sound and Willetts' powerful vocals. The album's slow and deliberate pace was also praised, with many reviewers noting the band's ability to create a sense of tension and release through their music.\n\nSome reviewers noted that the album's sound was more refined and polished than previous Bolt Thrower releases, with a greater emphasis on melody and atmosphere. Others praised the band's use of dynamics, noting the ways in which they created a sense of contrast and drama through their music.\n\n### Retrospective reviews and accolades\n\nIn the years following its release, Those Once Loyal has been recognized as a classic of the death metal genre. The album has been included on a range of \"best of\" lists, including those published by Metal Hammer and Terrorizer. The album's influence can also be heard in the music of a range of other metal bands, with many artists citing Bolt Thrower as a key influence.\n\nAftermath\n----------\n\nThose Once Loyal marked a significant milestone in Bolt Thrower's career, cementing the band's reputation as one of the leading acts in the death metal genre. The album's success also paved the way for future releases, including the 2008 album, Those Who Lay the Law.\n\nIn the years following the album's release, Bolt Thrower has continued to tour and record, with a range of live shows and festival appearances. The band has also undergone a number of lineup changes, with Willetts and Bench remaining the only constant members.\n\nTrack listing\n-------------\n\n1. \"At First Light\"\n2. \"Entrenched\"\n3. \"The Killchain\"\n4. \"Granite Wall\"\n5. \"Those Once Loyal\"\n6. \"Anti-Tank (Dead Armour)\"\n7. \"Last Stand of Humanity\"\n8. \"When Cannons Fade\"\n\nPersonnel\n----------\n\n* Karl Willetts - vocals\n* Gavin Ward - guitar\n* Barry Thompson - guitar\n* Jo Bench - bass\n* Martin van Drunen - drums\n\nCharts\n------\n\n* UK Albums Chart: #163\n* US Billboard 200: #176\n\nRelease history\n----------------\n\n* 11 November 2005 - Metal Blade Records (Europe)\n* 15 November 2005 - Metal Blade Records (North America)\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n*Note: This article does not include any citations or references.\n\nBibliography\n------------\n\n*Note: This article does not include any bibliography entries.\n\nExternal links\n---------------\n\n* Bolt Thrower's official website\n* Metal Blade Records' website", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Those_Once_Loyal\" following this outline:\n\n#Background and recording\n#Composition\n##Music\n##Lyrics\n##Title and artwork\n#Release\n##Promotion\n##Those Still Loyal Tour\n#Reception\n##Contemporaneous reviews\n##Retrospective reviews and accolades\n#Aftermath\n#Track listing\n#Personnel\n#Charts\n#Release history\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Her exploits have been widely reported in the media, and she has become a subject of fascination for many.\n\n#Early life\n\nAnna Sorokin was born on January 23, 1991, in Domodedovo, Russia. Her father, Vladimir Sorokin, was a truck driver, and her mother, Natalya Sorokina, was a homemaker. Sorokin grew up in a modest household with her parents and older brother. In 2007, her family moved to Germany, where Sorokin attended a local high school.\n\nAfter completing her secondary education, Sorokin moved to Paris to pursue a career in fashion. She worked as an intern at a fashion magazine and later moved to New York City in 2013 to pursue a career in the fashion industry. Sorokin quickly became known for her glamorous lifestyle and high-end fashion sense, which she showcased on social media.\n\n#Fraud\n\nBetween 2013 and 2017, Sorokin posed as a wealthy heiress and scammed various individuals and businesses in New York City. She used fake identities and false financial documents to convince people that she was a wealthy trust fund baby. Sorokin's scams included renting luxury apartments and hotels, buying expensive clothing and accessories, and dining at high-end restaurants.\n\nSorokin's most notable scam involved convincing a private jet company to let her charter a plane for a trip to Nebraska, which she never paid for. She also scammed a hotel in the Hamptons, where she racked up a bill of over $30,000. Sorokin's victims included friends, acquaintances, and business associates, many of whom were convinced by her charm and fake wealth.\n\n#Indictment and arrest\n\nIn November 2017, Sorokin was indicted on multiple counts of grand larceny and theft of services. She was arrested on November 8, 2017, at a New York City hotel, where she was staying under a pseudonym. Sorokin was taken into custody and held without bail.\n\n#Trial, conviction, and sentence\n\nSorokin's trial began in April 2019 and lasted for several weeks. During the trial, prosecutors presented evidence of Sorokin's scams, including fake financial documents and testimony from her victims. Sorokin's defense team argued that she was a victim of circumstance and that her actions were a cry for help.\n\nOn May 9, 2019, Sorokin was convicted of eight counts of grand larceny and theft of services. She was acquitted of one count of attempted grand larceny. On May 9, 2019, Sorokin was sentenced to four to 12 years in state prison.\n\n#ICE custody\n\nIn February 2021, Sorokin was released from prison after serving nearly two years of her sentence. However, she was immediately taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) due to her immigration status. Sorokin had overstayed her visa and was subject to deportation.\n\n#Media representation\n\nSorokin's exploits have been widely reported in the media, and she has become a subject of fascination for many. Her story has been featured in various publications, including The New York Times, Vanity Fair, and New York Magazine. Sorokin has also been the subject of several documentaries and TV shows, including the Netflix series \"Inventing Anna,\" which premiered in 2022.\n\n##Art shows\n\nIn 2022, Sorokin announced that she would be hosting an art show in New York City. The show, titled \"Allegedly,\" featured a collection of her artwork, including paintings and sketches. The show was widely covered in the media, and Sorokin's artwork was met with mixed reviews.\n\n##Non-fungible tokens\n\nIn 2022, Sorokin announced that she would be selling a collection of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the online marketplace Rarible. The NFTs featured a collection of her artwork, including digital paintings and sketches. Sorokin's NFTs were met with mixed reviews, with some critics accusing her of profiting from her notoriety.\n\n##Fashion\n\nSorokin has long been known for her high-end fashion sense, which she showcased on social media. In 2022, she announced that she would be launching her own fashion line, which would feature a collection of clothing and accessories. Sorokin's fashion line was met with mixed reviews, with some critics accusing her of profiting from her notoriety.\n\n#Personal life\n\nSorokin is currently single and lives in New York City. She has been open about her struggles with mental health and has spoken publicly about her experiences with depression and anxiety. Sorokin has also been open about her experiences with immigration and has spoken out about the need for greater support for immigrants.\n\n#See also\n\n* Con artist\n* Socialite\n* Fashion\n* Art\n* Non-fungible tokens\n\n#External links\n\n* Anna Sorokin on Instagram\n* Anna Sorokin on Twitter\n* \"Inventing Anna\" on Netflix", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Anna_Sorokin\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n#Fraud\n#Indictment and arrest\n#Trial, conviction, and sentence\n#ICE custody\n#Media representation\n#After prison\n##Art shows\n##Non-fungible tokens\n##Fashion\n#Personal life\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is a common and potentially life-threatening condition that can occur in various clinical settings, including high-altitude environments, anemia, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory disorders. Hypoxia can have significant effects on the body's physiological responses, leading to a range of signs and symptoms, and can result in long-term consequences if left untreated.\n\n# Classification\n\nHypoxia can be classified in various ways, depending on the cause, extent, and affected tissues and organs.\n\n## By cause\n\nHypoxia can be classified into four main categories based on the underlying cause: ischemic hypoxia, hypoxemic hypoxia, anemic hypoxia, and histotoxic hypoxia.\n\n## By extent\n\nHypoxia can also be classified based on the extent of the affected area.\n\n### Generalized hypoxia\n\nGeneralized hypoxia refers to a state of inadequate oxygen supply to the entire body. This can occur in conditions such as high-altitude environments, anemia, and respiratory disorders.\n\n### Localized hypoxia\n\nLocalized hypoxia refers to a state of inadequate oxygen supply to a specific region of the body. This can occur in conditions such as peripheral artery disease, where blood flow to the extremities is impaired.\n\n### By affected tissues and organs\n\nHypoxia can also be classified based on the specific tissues and organs affected.\n\n#### Cerebral hypoxia\n\nCerebral hypoxia refers to a state of inadequate oxygen supply to the brain. This can occur in conditions such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, and high-altitude environments.\n\n#### Corneal hypoxia\n\nCorneal hypoxia refers to a state of inadequate oxygen supply to the cornea. This can occur in conditions such as contact lens wear, where the lens can impede oxygen delivery to the cornea.\n\n#### Intrauterine hypoxia\n\nIntrauterine hypoxia refers to a state of inadequate oxygen supply to the fetus during pregnancy. This can occur in conditions such as placental insufficiency and umbilical cord compression.\n\n#### Tumor hypoxia\n\nTumor hypoxia refers to a state of inadequate oxygen supply to cancer cells. This can occur in conditions such as solid tumors, where the rapid growth of cancer cells can outstrip the delivery of oxygen.\n\n#### Vestibular system\n\nVestibular hypoxia refers to a state of inadequate oxygen supply to the vestibular system, which is responsible for balance and equilibrium. This can occur in conditions such as inner ear disorders and high-altitude environments.\n\n# Signs and symptoms\n\nThe signs and symptoms of hypoxia can vary depending on the severity and duration of the condition. Common signs and symptoms include:\n\n* Shortness of breath\n* Confusion and disorientation\n* Headache\n* Fatigue\n* Dizziness and lightheadedness\n* Pale or blue-tinged skin\n* Rapid heart rate\n\n## Complications\n\nIf left untreated, hypoxia can lead to a range of complications, including:\n\n* Cardiac arrest\n* Respiratory failure\n* Stroke\n* Seizures\n* Coma\n* Death\n\n# Causes\n\nHypoxia can be caused by a range of factors, including:\n\n## Ischemia\n\nIschemia refers to a state of inadequate blood flow to a region of the body. This can occur in conditions such as peripheral artery disease, where blood flow to the extremities is impaired.\n\n## Hypoxemic hypoxia\n\nHypoxemic hypoxia refers to a state of inadequate oxygen supply to the body due to low oxygen levels in the blood.\n\n### Carbon monoxide poisoning\n\nCarbon monoxide poisoning can cause hypoxemic hypoxia by reducing the amount of oxygen available to the body.\n\n### Altitude\n\nHigh-altitude environments can cause hypoxemic hypoxia by reducing the amount of oxygen available in the air.\n\n### Hypoxic breathing gases\n\nHypoxic breathing gases, such as those used in anesthesia, can cause hypoxemic hypoxia by reducing the amount of oxygen available to the body.\n\n### Other\n\nOther causes of hypoxemic hypoxia include respiratory disorders, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and anemia.\n\n## Anemia\n\nAnemia refers to a state of inadequate red blood cells or hemoglobin in the blood. This can reduce the amount of oxygen available to the body.\n\n## Histotoxic hypoxia\n\nHistotoxic hypoxia refers to a state of inadequate oxygen supply to the body due to the presence of toxins, such as cyanide.\n\n# Mechanism\n\nThe mechanism of hypoxia involves a range of physiological and pathological responses.\n\n## Physiological responses\n\nIn response to hypoxia, the body can activate a range of physiological responses, including:\n\n* Increased respiratory rate\n* Increased heart rate\n* Vasodilation\n* Increased glucose release from energy stores\n\n## Acute\n\nAcute hypoxia can cause a range of physiological responses, including:\n\n* Increased release of stress hormones, such as adrenaline\n* Increased release of vasodilators, such as nitric oxide\n\n## Chronic\n\nChronic hypoxia can cause a range of physiological responses, including:\n\n* Increased release of angiogenic factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)\n* Increased release of inflammatory cytokines\n\n## Pathological responses\n\nHypoxia can also cause a range of pathological responses, including:\n\n### Cerebral ischemia\n\nCerebral ischemia can cause a range of pathological responses, including:\n\n* Increased release of excitatory neurotransmitters, such as glutamate\n* Increased release of inflammatory cytokines\n\n### Myocardial ischemia\n\nMyocardial ischemia can cause a range of pathological responses, including:\n\n* Increased release of stress hormones, such as adrenaline\n* Increased release of inflammatory cytokines\n\n### Tumor angiogenesis\n\nTumor angiogenesis can cause a range of pathological responses, including:\n\n* Increased release of angiogenic factors, such as VEGF\n* Increased release of inflammatory cytokines\n\n# Diagnosis\n\nDiagnosis of hypoxia typically involves a combination of physical examination, medical history, and diagnostic tests.\n\n## Physical examination and history\n\nA physical examination and medical history can help identify signs and symptoms of hypoxia, such as shortness of breath, confusion, and pale skin.\n\n## Tests\n\nDiagnostic tests may include:\n\n* Pulse oximetry to measure oxygen saturation\n* Arterial blood gas analysis to measure oxygen levels in the blood\n* Complete blood count to measure red blood cell count and hemoglobin levels\n* Imaging studies, such as chest X-rays or computed tomography (CT) scans, to evaluate lung function and detect any underlying conditions.\n\n## Differential diagnosis\n\nDifferential diagnosis may include other conditions that can cause similar signs and symptoms, such as:\n\n* Anemia\n* Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\n* Asthma\n* Pneumonia\n\n# Prevention\n\nPrevention of hypoxia typically involves avoiding high-altitude environments, managing underlying medical conditions, and taking steps to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning.\n\n## Prevention of altitude induced hypoxia\n\nPrevention of altitude-induced hypoxia may include:\n\n* Gradual ascent to high altitudes\n* Use of supplemental oxygen\n* Avoiding strenuous exercise at high altitudes\n\n# Treatment and management\n\nTreatment and management of hypoxia typically involve addressing the underlying cause of the condition.\n\n## Treatment of acute and chronic cases\n\nTreatment of acute hypoxia may include:\n\n* Supplemental oxygen therapy\n* Mechanical ventilation\n* Medications to manage underlying conditions, such as anemia or COPD\n\nTreatment of chronic hypoxia may include:\n\n* Long-term oxygen therapy\n* Pulmonary rehabilitation\n* Medications to manage underlying conditions, such as anemia or COPD\n\n# Outcomes\n\nOutcomes of hypoxia can vary depending on the severity and duration of the condition.

It is a live-action adaptation of the 1940 Disney animated film of the same name, which is based on the 1881 Italian novel \"The Adventures of Pinocchio\" by Carlo Collodi. The film stars Tom Hanks, Benjamin Evan Ainsworth, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Keegan-Michael Key, and Cynthia Erivo.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe film follows the story of Geppetto, a poor woodcarver who creates a wooden puppet named Pinocchio. To his surprise, the puppet comes to life, and Geppetto wishes upon a star for Pinocchio to become a real boy. However, Pinocchio's journey to becoming a real boy is fraught with challenges and obstacles, as he is prone to telling lies and getting into trouble.\n\nWith the help of Jiminy Cricket, a wise and loyal insect who serves as Pinocchio's conscience, Pinocchio navigates the complexities of human behavior and learns valuable lessons about honesty, responsibility, and the importance of following one's heart. Along the way, Pinocchio encounters a cast of colorful characters, including the nefarious Coachman, who seeks to exploit Pinocchio for his own gain.\n\nAs Pinocchio faces various challenges and temptations, he must confront the consequences of his actions and learn to make amends. Ultimately, Pinocchio's journey is one of self-discovery and growth, as he learns to become a real boy and find his place in the world.\n\n# Cast\n\n* Tom Hanks as Geppetto\n* Benjamin Evan Ainsworth as Pinocchio\n* Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Jiminy Cricket\n* Keegan-Michael Key as Honest John\n* Cynthia Erivo as the Blue Fairy\n* Luke Evans as the Coachman\n* Kyanne Lamaya as Fabiana\n* Giuseppe Battiston as Stromboli\n\n# Production\n\n## Development\n\nThe development of the live-action Pinocchio film began in 2015, when Walt Disney Pictures announced plans to adapt the 1940 animated film into a live-action feature. Robert Zemeckis was hired to direct the film, with Chris Weitz serving as co-writer. The project was initially set to be released in 2017, but was delayed several times due to production issues and changes in the creative team.\n\n## Casting\n\nThe casting process for Pinocchio was a long and extensive one, with several actors and actresses considered for the lead roles. Tom Hanks was the first actor to be cast, signing on to play Geppetto in 2018. Benjamin Evan Ainsworth was cast as Pinocchio in 2020, after a lengthy auditioning process.\n\n## Filming\n\nPrincipal photography for Pinocchio began in March 2021 and wrapped in July 2021. The film was shot on location in Italy and the United Kingdom, with additional filming taking place at Pinewood Studios.\n\n## Visual effects and animation\n\nThe visual effects and animation for Pinocchio were created by Moving Picture Company (MPC), with a team of over 500 artists and technicians working on the project. The film's visual effects were designed to bring the fantastical elements of the story to life, including Pinocchio's transformation from a wooden puppet to a real boy.\n\n# Music\n\nThe score for Pinocchio was composed by Alan Silvestri, who has collaborated with Robert Zemeckis on several previous films. The soundtrack features a mix of original songs and music from the 1940 animated film, including \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" and \"Hi-Diddle-Dee-Dee\".\n\n# Marketing\n\nThe marketing campaign for Pinocchio began in 2022, with the release of a teaser trailer in February. The trailer featured footage of Pinocchio and Geppetto, as well as a glimpse of the film's visual effects. A full trailer was released in May, showcasing more of the film's action and adventure sequences.\n\n# Release\n\nPinocchio was released in the United States on September 8, 2022, and in the United Kingdom on October 7, 2022. The film was initially set to be released in theaters, but was later changed to a streaming release on Disney+, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n# Reception\n\n## Audience viewership\n\nPinocchio was a major hit for Disney+, with the film attracting millions of viewers in its first week of release.

The storm was the second named storm of the 2022 Atlantic hurricane season and caused significant damage and disruption in its wake.\n\n# Meteorological history\n\nBonnie originated from a tropical wave that emerged off the coast of West Africa on July 1, 2022. The wave moved westward across the tropical Atlantic, gradually developing a closed circulation and strengthening into a tropical depression on July 3. The depression was located about 1,500 miles (2,400 km) east of the Lesser Antilles at the time.\n\nOver the next few days, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm, earning the name Bonnie. The storm moved westward at a moderate pace, taking advantage of favorable environmental conditions, including low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures. Bonnie's intensification was fueled by its interaction with a mid-level trough, which provided the necessary lift and instability for the storm to strengthen.\n\nOn July 7, Bonnie reached hurricane strength, with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph (130 km/h). The storm continued to intensify, reaching its peak intensity on July 9, with maximum sustained winds of 120 mph (195 km/h). Bonnie's minimum central pressure was 970 mbar (28.64 inHg) at the time.\n\nAfter reaching its peak intensity, Bonnie began to weaken due to increasing wind shear and cooler sea surface temperatures. The storm made landfall in southern Nicaragua on July 12, bringing heavy rainfall and strong winds to the region. Bonnie's circulation dissipated over the southeastern United States on July 15.\n\n# Preparations and impacts\n\n## Trinidad and Tobago\n\nTrinidad and Tobago was one of the first countries to be affected by Hurricane Bonnie. The storm passed about 100 miles (160 km) north of the island on July 5, bringing tropical storm-force winds and heavy rainfall. The country's meteorological service issued a tropical storm watch on July 4, which was later upgraded to a tropical storm warning.\n\nThe storm caused significant disruptions to the country's infrastructure, including power outages and road closures. The country's national emergency management agency reported that over 1,000 households were affected by the storm, with many residents forced to seek shelter in emergency centers.\n\n## Mexico\n\nMexico was also severely affected by Hurricane Bonnie. The storm made landfall in the state of Oaxaca on July 12, bringing heavy rainfall and strong winds to the region. The country's national meteorological service issued a hurricane warning for the state, which was later extended to include the states of Chiapas and Tabasco.\n\nThe storm caused widespread flooding and landslides in the affected areas, with many communities cut off from aid. The country's emergency management agency reported that over 10,000 households were affected by the storm, with many residents forced to seek shelter in emergency centers.\n\n## Elsewhere\n\nOther countries in the Caribbean and Central America were also affected by Hurricane Bonnie. The storm brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to Belize, Guatemala, and Honduras, causing significant disruptions to the countries' infrastructure.\n\nIn the United States, the storm brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to the southeastern states, particularly Florida and Georgia. The country's national weather service issued a flood watch for several counties in the affected areas, with many residents forced to evacuate their homes.\n\n# See also\n\n* 2022 Atlantic hurricane season\n* List of Category 3 hurricanes in the Atlantic Basin\n* List of storms with the name Bonnie\n\n# External links\n\n* National Hurricane Center's advisory archive for Hurricane Bonnie\n* National Weather Service's storm report for Hurricane Bonnie\n* ReliefWeb's page for Hurricane Bonnie", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Hurricane_Bonnie_(2022)\" following this outline:\n\n#Meteorological history\n#Preparations and impacts\n##Trinidad and Tobago\n##Mexico\n##Elsewhere\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
