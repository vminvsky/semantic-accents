The election was triggered by the resignation of Nicola Sturgeon as leader of the SNP on February 15, 2023. The contest was contested by three candidates: Kate Forbes, Ash Regan, and Humza Yousaf.\n\n# Background\n\nNicola Sturgeon had been the leader of the SNP since November 2014 and the First Minister of Scotland since the same month. During her tenure, she had led the party through two Scottish Parliament elections and the 2019 UK general election, as well as navigating the complexities of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, in February 2023, Sturgeon announced her resignation as leader of the SNP, citing a desire to spend more time with her family and to allow a new leader to take the party forward.\n\nThe SNP's national executive committee (NEC) subsequently announced the rules for the leadership contest, which included a requirement for candidates to secure the support of at least 100 party members to be nominated. The contest was also subject to a one-member-one-vote system, with all SNP members eligible to vote.\n\n# Issues\n\nThe leadership contest took place against the backdrop of several key issues that were relevant to the SNP and the Scottish Government.\n\n## Economics\n\nOne of the key issues in the contest was the state of the Scottish economy. The SNP had long advocated for Scottish independence, which would give the country control over its own economic policy. However, the party had also faced criticism for its handling of the economy, including the performance of key sectors such as oil and gas.\n\n## Independence\n\nThe issue of Scottish independence was also a central theme in the leadership contest. The SNP had long campaigned for independence, and the party's constitution commits it to achieving this goal. However, the party had faced setbacks in recent years, including the 2014 independence referendum and the UK Supreme Court's ruling that the Scottish Parliament did not have the power to hold a second referendum without the consent of the UK Parliament.\n\n## Gender recognition reform\n\nAnother issue that was relevant to the leadership contest was the Scottish Government's proposed reforms to the Gender Recognition Act. The reforms, which had been a key priority for Nicola Sturgeon, aimed to make it easier for transgender people to change their legal gender. However, the proposals had faced opposition from some within the party, who argued that they did not go far enough to protect the rights of women.\n\n# Campaign\n\nThe leadership contest was marked by a series of campaigns by the three candidates, each of whom sought to set out their vision for the SNP and the Scottish Government.\n\n## Nomination period\n\nThe nomination period for the contest opened on February 20, 2023, and closed on March 1, 2023. During this time, candidates were required to secure the support of at least 100 party members to be nominated.\n\n## Kate Forbes\n\nKate Forbes, the Finance Secretary, was the first candidate to launch her campaign. Forbes had been a key figure in the Scottish Government, and had played a leading role in the development of the party's economic policy. Her campaign focused on the need for the SNP to develop a more nuanced approach to the economy, and to prioritize the needs of business and industry.\n\n## Ash Regan\n\nAsh Regan, a former minister, launched her campaign on February 22, 2023. Regan had been a key figure in the SNP's left wing, and had been a vocal critic of the party's leadership in recent years. Her campaign focused on the need for the SNP to return to its radical roots, and to prioritize the needs of the most vulnerable members of society.\n\n## Humza Yousaf\n\nHumza Yousaf, the Health Secretary, launched his campaign on February 24, 2023. Yousaf had been a key figure in the Scottish Government, and had played a leading role in the development of the party's health policy. His campaign focused on the need for the SNP to prioritize the needs of the NHS, and to develop a more comprehensive approach to public health.\n\n## Hustings\n\nThe three candidates took part in a series of hustings events, which were organized by the SNP's NEC. The events gave party members the opportunity to question the candidates and to hear their views on key issues.\n\n## Row about membership numbers\n\nDuring the campaign, a row broke out about the number of SNP members who were eligible to vote in the contest. The party's NEC had announced that the contest would be confined to members who had joined the party before February 2023. However, some candidates argued that this was unfair, and that it would disenfranchise thousands of members who had joined the party in recent weeks.\n\n# Election process\n\nThe election process for the leadership contest was overseen by the SNP's NEC. The contest was subject to a one-member-one-vote system, with all SNP members eligible to vote. The NEC also established a series of rules for the contest, including a requirement for candidates to secure the support of at least 100 party members to be nominated.\n\n# Candidates\n\nThree candidates stood in the leadership contest.\n\n## Declared\n\n* Kate Forbes\n* Ash Regan\n* Humza Yousaf\n\n## Declined\n\nSeveral other senior SNP figures declined to stand in the contest, including the party's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, and the Deputy First Minister, John Swinney.\n\n# Endorsements\n\nThe three candidates received endorsements from various SNP figures and organizations.\n\n## Kate Forbes\n\nForbes was endorsed by several senior SNP figures, including the party's former leader, Alex Salmond, and the former First Minister, Jack McConnell.\n\n## Ash Regan\n\nRegan was endorsed by several left-wing SNP figures, including the party's former deputy leader, Angus Robertson, and the former minister, Mark McDonald.\n\n## Humza Yousaf\n\nYousaf was endorsed by several senior SNP figures, including the party's former leader, Nicola Sturgeon, and the Deputy First Minister, John Swinney.\n\n## Declined to endorse\n\nSeveral senior SNP figures declined to endorse any of the candidates, including the party's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, and the former First Minister, Henry McLeish.\n\n# Debates\n\nThe three candidates took part in a series of debates, which were broadcast on television and radio. The debates gave the candidates the opportunity to set out their views on key issues and to respond to questions from journalists and party members.\n\n# Hustings\n\nThe three candidates also took part in a series of hustings events, which were organized by the SNP's NEC. The events gave party members the opportunity to question the candidates and to hear their views on key issues.\n\n# Opinion polling\n\nSeveral opinion polls were conducted during the leadership contest, which gave an indication of the level of support for each of the candidates.\n\n## SNP membership\n\nA poll of SNP members found that Humza Yousaf was the most popular candidate, with 42% of the vote. Kate Forbes was second, with 32%, and Ash Regan was third, with 26%.\n\n## 2021 SNP voters\n\nA poll of SNP voters from the 2021 Scottish Parliament election found that Humza Yousaf was the most popular candidate, with 45% of the vote. Kate Forbes was second, with 29%, and Ash Regan was third, with 26%.\n\n## Scottish public\n\nA poll of the Scottish public found that Humza Yousaf was the most popular candidate, with 34% of the vote. Kate Forbes was second, with 24%, and Ash Regan was third, with 22%.\n\n# Results\n\nThe results of the leadership contest were announced on March 27, 2023. Humza Yousaf was declared the winner, with 52.1% of the vote. Kate Forbes was second, with 31.7%, and Ash Regan was third, with 16.2%.\n\n## Preference votes by candidate\n\n* Humza Yousaf: 52.1%\n* Kate Forbes: 31.7%\n* Ash Regan: 16.2%\n\n# Aftermath\n\nFollowing the announcement of the results, Humza Yousaf was formally appointed as the leader of the SNP and the First Minister of Scotland. He pledged to work tirelessly to promote the interests of Scotland and to deliver on the party's manifesto commitments.\n\nThe leadership contest was seen as a significant moment in the history of the SNP, marking a new era for the party and a fresh direction for the Scottish Government.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Scottish_National_Party_leadership_election\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Issues\n##Economics\n##Independence\n##Gender recognition reform\n#Campaign\n##Nomination period\n##Kate Forbes\n##Ash Regan\n##Humza Yousaf\n##Hustings\n##Row about membership numbers\n#Election process\n#Candidates\n##Declared\n##Declined\n#Endorsements\n##Kate Forbes\n##Ash Regan\n##Humza Yousaf\n##Declined to endorse\n#Debates\n#Hustings\n#Opinion polling\n##SNP membership\n##2021 SNP voters\n##Scottish public\n#Results\n##Preference votes by candidate\n#Aftermath\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The mountain has been a popular destination for outdoor enthusiasts and nature lovers for centuries, offering a wide range of recreational activities and breathtaking views. This article provides an overview of Silly Mountain's location, origin of its name, flora, fauna, geology, and recreational opportunities.\n\n#Location\n\nSilly Mountain is situated in the Whimsy Range, a mountainous region that stretches across several counties in the western part of the country. The mountain is approximately 10 miles (16 kilometers) east of the town of Sillimania and 20 miles (32 kilometers) west of the city of Whimsyville. The mountain's summit elevation is 4,200 feet (1,280 meters) above sea level, making it one of the highest peaks in the Whimsy Range.\n\n#Origin of the name\n\nThe origin of the name \"Silly Mountain\" is unclear, but there are several theories. One theory suggests that the name \"Silly\" comes from the mountain's unusual shape, which resembles a giant's hat. Another theory proposes that the name \"Silly\" is derived from the word \"sill,\" a geological term that refers to a layer of rock that forms a narrow, horizontal band. Yet another theory suggests that the name \"Silly\" is simply a colloquialism that was adopted by local residents to describe the mountain's whimsical nature.\n\n#Flora\n\nSilly Mountain is home to a diverse range of flora, including trees, shrubs, and wildflowers. The mountain's forests are dominated by coniferous species such as pine, spruce, and fir, which thrive in the cool, moist climate. Deciduous species such as oak, maple, and beech are also present, particularly in the mountain's lower elevations.

The association was established in 1909 and has since grown to become one of the largest and most competitive regional football leagues in the state.\n\n# History\n\nThe Faithful & District Football Association was formed in 1909, with the aim of providing a structured competition for football clubs in the Faithful region. The association's early years were marked by a series of challenges, including the impact of World War I on player numbers and the difficulties of traveling between clubs in a rural area. Despite these challenges, the association persevered and continued to grow, adding new clubs and expanding its reach throughout the region.\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, the association began to establish itself as a major force in regional football, with several of its clubs competing in statewide competitions. The association's success during this period was driven by the strength of its clubs, which were able to attract top players from across the region.\n\nIn the post-war period, the association continued to grow and expand, with new clubs joining the competition and existing clubs experiencing significant success. The association's grand final, which is played annually between the top two teams in the competition, became a major event in the regional sporting calendar.\n\nIn recent years, the association has continued to evolve, with the introduction of new rules and competitions aimed at promoting player safety and development. The association has also invested heavily in infrastructure, including the development of new grounds and facilities for its member clubs.\n\n## Expansion and Restructuring\n\nIn the 1990s, the association underwent a significant expansion, with several new clubs joining the competition. This expansion was driven by the association's desire to increase its reach and provide more opportunities for players and clubs in the region.\n\nIn 2001, the association underwent a major restructuring, with the introduction of a new divisional system. This system, which featured three divisions, was designed to provide more competitive balance and opportunities for clubs to develop and improve.\n\n## Modern Era\n\nIn recent years, the association has continued to thrive, with a strong focus on player development and community engagement. The association has invested heavily in programs aimed at promoting junior football and increasing participation in the sport.\n\nIn 2019, the association celebrated its 110th anniversary, marking a major milestone in its history. The association's anniversary celebrations featured a range of events and activities, including a gala dinner and a commemorative match played between past and present players.\n\n# Football Clubs\n\nThe Faithful & District Football Association currently features 16 member clubs, each with its own unique history and traditions. These clubs are:\n\n1. Ararat Football Club\n2. Beaufort Football Club\n3. Buninyong Football Club\n4. Carngham-Linton Football Club\n5. Clunes Football Club\n6. Creswick Football Club\n7.

Springbank Football Club\n15. Trentham Football Club\n16. Wickliffe-Lake Bolac Football Club\n\nEach of these clubs has its own dedicated following and plays an important role in the local community.\n\n## Club Histories\n\nEach of the association's member clubs has its own unique history and traditions. Some of the clubs have been in existence for over 100 years, while others have been established more recently.\n\nOne of the oldest clubs in the association is the Ararat Football Club, which was established in 1871. The club has a rich history and has won numerous premierships throughout its existence.\n\nAnother club with a long and storied history is the Beaufort Football Club, which was established in 1881. The club has won several premierships and has produced a number of talented players who have gone on to compete at higher levels.\n\n# Football Grand Finals\n\nThe association's grand final is played annually between the top two teams in the competition. The match is typically played in September and is considered one of the highlights of the regional sporting calendar.\n\nThe grand final has a long and storied history, dating back to the early days of the association. Over the years, the match has been played at a number of different venues, including the Ararat Football Ground and the Beaufort Football Ground.\n\n## Grand Final Records\n\nThe association's grand final has been played a total of 112 times, with the first match taking place in 1909. The most successful club in grand final history is the Ararat Football Club, which has won 17 premierships.\n\nThe Beaufort Football Club is second on the list, with 14 premierships, while the Buninyong Football Club has won 12.\n\n# O'Loan Cup\n\nThe O'Loan Cup is a prestigious award that is presented annually to the best and fairest player in the association. The award is named after Tom O'Loan, a former player and administrator who made a significant contribution to the association.\n\nThe O'Loan Cup has been presented since 1921 and has been won by some of the association's greatest players. The award is considered one of the highest honors in the association and is highly coveted by players.\n\n## O'Loan Cup Winners\n\nThe O'Loan Cup has been won by a total of 56 different players since its inception.

The visual effects team, led by Michael Gioulakis, worked closely with Mangold and his team to create a unique and immersive visual style for the film.\n\n###De-aging\n\nOne of the most notable visual effects in the film is the de-aging of Harrison Ford, who appears in several scenes as a younger Indiana Jones. The de-aging process was achieved using a combination of CGI and practical effects, with Ford's face and body digitally altered to appear younger.\n\n##Music\n\nThe film's score was composed by John Williams, who has worked on all five Indiana Jones films. The score features a range of themes and motifs, including the iconic Indiana Jones theme, which has been reworked and reorchestrated for the film.\n\n#Themes and influences\n\nIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny explores a range of themes, including the power of the past, the danger of nostalgia, and the importance of family and relationships.

However, some critics have noted that the film's pacing and plot are uneven, and that it relies too heavily on nostalgia and retro-futurism.\n\n##Accolades\n\nIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny has been nominated for several awards, including the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects. The film has also been recognized by several critics' associations, including the Critics' Choice Movie Awards and the Satellite Awards.\n\n#Future\n\nIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is the fifth and final film in the Indiana Jones franchise, with Harrison Ford set to retire from the role after its release.

With a career spanning over six decades, Țăranu has established himself as a prominent figure in the Romanian musical landscape, exploring a wide range of styles and genres.\n\n# Biography\n\n## Early life and neoclassical debut\n\nCornel Țăranu was born on June 20, 1934, in Cluj-Napoca, Romania. He began his musical studies at the Cluj-Napoca Music Conservatory, where he was exposed to a variety of musical styles and influences. During his early years, Țăranu was particularly drawn to the neoclassical style, which would later become a hallmark of his compositional approach. His early works, such as the Suite for Orchestra (1955) and the String Quartet No. 1 (1956), demonstrate a clear affinity for the neoclassical idiom, characterized by clarity, precision, and a focus on formal structure.\n\n## Paris studies and Ars Nova\n\nIn 1960, Țăranu traveled to Paris, where he studied at the École Normale de Musique with renowned composers such as Olivier Messiaen and Pierre Boulez. This period marked a significant turning point in Țăranu's career, as he became increasingly interested in the avant-garde movement and the works of the Ars Nova group. His exposure to the music of Boulez, in particular, had a profound impact on his compositional style, leading to the creation of works such as the Piano Sonata No. 1 (1962) and the String Quartet No. 2 (1963). These pieces showcase Țăranu's growing interest in experimentation and innovation, as well as his ability to blend traditional and modern elements.\n\n## Postmodernism and historicism\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, Țăranu's compositional style underwent a significant transformation, as he began to explore postmodernist and historicist tendencies. His music from this period, such as the Symphony No. 2 (1975) and the Opera \"Carmen\" (1981), demonstrates a renewed interest in traditional forms and genres, as well as a willingness to engage with popular culture and historical references. This shift in style was likely influenced by Țăranu's growing concern with the social and cultural context of music, as well as his desire to connect with a broader audience.\n\n## Old age\n\nIn recent years, Țăranu has continued to compose music, albeit at a slower pace. His later works, such as the Piano Sonata No. 3 (2001) and the String Quartet No. 4 (2005), demonstrate a greater emphasis on introspection and contemplation, as well as a deepening interest in spirituality and the human condition. Despite his advanced age, Țăranu remains active in the musical community, serving as a professor and mentor to younger composers.\n\n# Selected works\n\n* Suite for Orchestra (1955)\n* String Quartet No. 1 (1956)\n* Piano Sonata No. 1 (1962)\n* String Quartet No. 2 (1963)\n* Symphony No. 2 (1975)\n* Opera \"Carmen\" (1981)\n* Piano Sonata No. 2 (1985)\n* String Quartet No. 3 (1990)\n* Piano Sonata No. 3 (2001)\n* String Quartet No. 4 (2005)\n\n# References\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)\n\n# External links\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Cornel_Țăranu\" following this outline:\n\n#Biography\n##Early life and neoclassical debut\n##Paris studies and Ars Nova\n##Postmodernism and historicism\n##Old age\n#Selected works\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

South African law recognizes the importance of an individual's right to dispose of their property as they see fit, but also imposes certain limitations and requirements on the exercise of this right.\n\n# Freedom of Testation\n\nFreedom of testation is the principle that an individual has the right to dispose of their property as they see fit, without undue restriction or interference from others. This principle is enshrined in the South African Constitution, which guarantees the right to property and the right to freedom of testation.\n\n## Limitations\n\nWhile freedom of testation is an important principle, it is not absolute. There are certain limitations and restrictions on the exercise of this right, which are designed to protect the rights of others and to ensure that the distribution of an estate is fair and reasonable.\n\n### Illegal Dispositions and Those Against Public Policy\n\nA testator may not make dispositions that are contrary to law or public policy. For example, a testator may not leave their property to a person who is not a citizen of South Africa, or to a person who is not a natural person.\n\n### Subdivision of Agricultural Land\n\nThe Subdivision of Agricultural Land Act regulates the subdivision of agricultural land, and prohibits the subdivision of such land into smaller portions than those prescribed by the Act.\n\n### Subdivision of Mineral Rights\n\nThe Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act regulates the subdivision of mineral rights, and prohibits the subdivision of such rights into smaller portions than those prescribed by the Act.\n\n### Fideicommissum Multiplex\n\nA fideicommissum multiplex is a type of testamentary disposition that involves the creation of multiple successive interests in the same property.

A provincial will is a will that was made in a province other than the province in which the testator died.\n\n# Joint or Mutual Wills\n\nA joint or mutual will is a will that is made by two or more people, who are usually spouses or partners.\n\n# Probate of Wills\n\nProbate refers to the process by which a court grants permission for the executor or administrator to distribute the estate of the testator.\n\n## Lost Wills\n\nA lost will may be proved by secondary evidence, such as a copy of the will or a statement from a witness.\n\n# Content of Wills\n\nA will may contain a variety of provisions, including:\n\n* A gift of property to a person or organization\n* A direction to pay a debt or other obligation\n* A nomination of an executor or administrator\n* A direction to distribute the residue of the estate\n\n## Inheritance and Legacy\n\nA gift of property to a person or organization may be an inheritance or a legacy.\n\n## Prior and Legal Rights\n\nA person may have prior or

During this time, English colonists established settlements in the New World, bringing with them their architectural traditions and adapting them to the new environment. In Massachusetts, the First Period saw the construction of numerous houses that reflected the social, economic, and cultural context of the colony. This article will explore the characteristics and notable examples of First Period houses in Massachusetts, specifically focusing on the period between 1660 and 1679.\n\n#Legend\n\nThe term \"First Period\" was coined by architectural historian Abbott Lowell Cummings in the 1970s to describe the earliest phase of American colonial architecture. Cummings defined the First Period as spanning from the early 17th century to around 1700, during which time English colonists established settlements in the New World. The First Period is characterized by the use of traditional English building techniques, such as timber framing, and the incorporation of local materials and influences.\n\n## Characteristics of First Period Houses\n\nFirst Period houses in Massachusetts were typically constructed using traditional English building techniques, such as timber framing and wattle and daub infill. The houses were often small, with a central chimney and a simple, rectangular plan. The use of local materials, such as wood and stone, was prevalent, and the houses often featured steeply pitched roofs to shed snow.\n\n## Regional Variations\n\nWhile First Period houses in Massachusetts shared certain characteristics, there were also regional variations. Houses in the coastal regions, such as Salem and Boston, were often influenced by maritime trade and featured more elaborate detailing, such as carved woodwork and ornate chimneys. In contrast, houses in the interior regions, such as the Connecticut River Valley, were often simpler and more rustic.\n\n#1660–1670\n\nThe period between 1660 and 1670 saw significant growth and development in Massachusetts, with the population increasing from approximately 15,000 to 30,000. During this time, numerous houses were constructed, many of which have survived to the present day.\n\n## Notable Examples\n\n* The Fairbanks House (Dedham, 1636-1637): While not strictly within the 1660-1670 period, the Fairbanks House is one of the oldest surviving houses in the United States and is often cited as an example of First Period architecture.\n* The Quincy Homestead (Quincy, 1660s): This house, now a museum, was built in the 1660s for Edmund Quincy and features a classic First Period plan, with a central chimney and a simple, rectangular shape.\n* The Cooper-Frost-Austin House (Cambridge, 1660s): This house, now owned by the Cambridge Historical Society, is one of the oldest surviving houses in Cambridge and features a unique blend of English and local influences.\n\n#1671–1679\n\nThe period between 1671 and 1679 saw continued growth and development in Massachusetts, with the population increasing from approximately 30,000 to 40,000. During this time, numerous houses were constructed, many of which reflected the increasing prosperity and sophistication of the colony.\n\n## Notable Examples\n\n* The Parson Capen House (Topsfield, 1673): This house, now a museum, was built in 1673 for Reverend Joseph Capen and features a classic First Period plan, with a central chimney and a simple, rectangular shape.\n* The Gedney House (Salem, 1665): This house, now a museum, was built in 1665 for Eleazer Gedney and features a unique blend of English and local influences, including a steeply pitched roof and ornate chimneys.\n* The Swett-Ilsley House (Newbury, 1670s): This house, now a private residence, was built in the 1670s and features a classic First Period plan, with a central chimney and a simple, rectangular shape.\n\n#See also\n\n* First Period architecture\n* Colonial architecture\n* Massachusetts architecture\n* American colonial architecture\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is a general overview of First Period houses in Massachusetts, specifically focusing on the period between 1660 and 1679. While it provides a comprehensive introduction to the subject, it is not an exhaustive treatment.

Developed by Instagram's parent company, Meta Platforms, the platform allows users to have discussions and share text posts.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### Predecessor\n\nThreads was not the first attempt by Meta to create a text-based social networking platform. In 2022, the company released a Notes feature on Instagram, which allowed users to post text-only updates. However, the feature did not gain significant traction and was eventually shut down.\n\n### Development and announcement\n\nThe development of Threads began in early 2023, with a team of engineers and designers working on the project. The platform was announced in July 2023, with an initial rollout in the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\n### Launch\n\nThreads was officially launched on July 5, 2023, with a gradual rollout to other countries. The platform was available as a standalone app, as well as a feature within the Instagram app.\n\nAppearance and features\n----------------------\n\n### Possibility of open interoperability\n\nOne of the notable features of Threads is the possibility of open interoperability with other social media platforms. This would allow users to share content and communicate with users on other platforms, creating a more interconnected social media ecosystem.\n\n### Account integration with Instagram\n\nThreads allows users to link their Instagram accounts, making it easier to share content and find friends on the platform. Users can also use their Instagram login credentials to access Threads.\n\n### Device compatibility\n\nThreads is available on both iOS and Android devices, as well as on the web. The platform is optimized for mobile devices, with a user-friendly interface and easy navigation.\n\n### Censorship attempts\n\nLike other social media platforms, Threads has faced censorship attempts from governments and other organizations. The platform has implemented measures to prevent the spread of misinformation and hate speech, but some critics argue that these measures are inadequate.\n\n### Advertising\n\nThreads allows businesses to create ads on the platform, using a variety of targeting options to reach their desired audience. The platform also offers a range of ad formats, including sponsored posts and stories.\n\nUserbase\n--------\n\n### Decline in the months after launch\n\nAfter a strong initial launch, the userbase of Threads declined in the months that followed. The platform struggled to retain users, with many citing a lack of engaging content and features.\n\n### Popularity in Taiwan\n\nDespite the decline in userbase, Threads remained popular in Taiwan, where it was seen as a platform for discussing politics and social issues. The platform's popularity in Taiwan was largely due to the country's vibrant online community and the lack of censorship on the platform.\n\nResponses\n---------\n\n### Intellectual property dispute\n\nThreads has been involved in an intellectual property dispute with another social media platform, which claimed that the platform's features and design were copied from their own platform. The dispute is ongoing, with both parties claiming that they have done nothing wrong.\n\n### Data privacy\n\nThreads has faced criticism over its data privacy policies, with some users expressing concern over the amount of data collected by the platform. The platform has implemented measures to protect user data, but some critics argue that these measures are inadequate.\n\n### State media\n\nThreads has been criticized by state media outlets in some countries, which claim that the platform is being used to spread misinformation and propaganda. The platform has implemented measures to prevent the spread of misinformation, but some critics argue that these measures are inadequate.\n\n### Imitating other platforms\n\nThreads has been accused of imitating other social media platforms, with some critics arguing that the platform's features and design are too similar to those of other platforms. The platform has denied these claims, stating that it is simply providing users with the features and functionality that they want.\n\nSee also\n---------\n\n* Social media\n* Microblogging\n* Online community\n* Social networking service\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nFurther reading\n---------------\n\nExternal links\n---------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Threads_(social_network)\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Predecessor\n##Development and announcement\n##Launch\n#Appearance and features\n##Possibility of open interoperability\n##Account integration with Instagram\n##Device compatibility\n##Censorship attempts\n##Advertising\n#Userbase\n##Decline in the months after launch\n##Popularity in Taiwan\n#Responses\n##Intellectual property dispute\n##Data privacy\n##State media\n##Imitating other platforms\n#See also\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

These gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, trap heat from the sun and prevent it from being released back into space, leading to a rise in the planet's average temperature. The effects of climate change are far-reaching and varied, impacting not only the environment but also human societies and economies.\n\n# Changes in Temperature\n\nOne of the most direct and obvious effects of climate change is the increase in global temperatures. The average global temperature has risen by about 1°C since the late 1800s, and the 20 warmest years on record have all occurred since 1981. This warming is not limited to the atmosphere; the oceans, which absorb most of the excess heat, have also warmed, with the top 700 meters of the ocean showing a temperature increase of about 0.7°C since the 1970s.\n\n# Weather\n\nClimate change is also affecting the weather, leading to more extreme and unpredictable events. This is because a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture, leading to more intense precipitation events, and also because the jet stream, a high-altitude wind current that drives weather patterns, is becoming more unstable.\n\n## Heat Waves and Temperature Extremes\n\nHeat waves, which are periods of abnormally hot weather, are becoming more frequent and prolonged. This is particularly evident in the summer months, when the increased heat can have serious impacts on human health, especially for vulnerable populations such as the elderly and young children. Temperature extremes, such as the record-breaking heat wave that affected Europe in 2019, are also becoming more common.\n\n## Rain\n\nClimate change is also affecting precipitation patterns, leading to more frequent and intense rainfall events. This can cause flooding, landslides, and other hazards, especially in areas with poor drainage or infrastructure. In some regions, the increased rainfall is also leading to more frequent and severe droughts, as the rain falls in intense bursts rather than steady, soaking rains.\n\n## Extreme Storms\n\nClimate change is also linked to an increase in extreme storms, including hurricanes, typhoons, and tornadoes. Warmer ocean temperatures can fuel more intense storms, and rising sea levels can exacerbate storm surges, which are walls of water that can inundate coastal areas.\n\n# Land\n\nClimate change is having significant impacts on the land, including increased flooding, droughts, and wildfires.\n\n## Floods\n\nFlooding is becoming more frequent and severe, especially in areas with poor drainage or infrastructure. This can be due to heavy rainfall, storm surges, or snowmelt, and can have devastating impacts on communities and ecosystems.\n\n## Droughts\n\nDroughts, which are periods of abnormally dry weather, are becoming more frequent and prolonged. This can have serious impacts on agriculture, water supplies, and ecosystems, especially in regions that are already water-scarce.\n\n## Wildfires\n\nClimate change is also contributing to an increase in wildfires, especially in regions with hot and dry summers. Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns can create conditions that are ripe for wildfires, which can have devastating impacts on ecosystems and human communities.\n\n# Oceans\n\nClimate change is having significant impacts on the oceans, including sea level rise, ocean acidification, and changes in ocean circulation patterns.\n\n## Sea Level Rise\n\nSea levels are rising due to the melting of glaciers and ice sheets, as well as the thermal expansion of seawater. This can cause coastal erosion, flooding, and saltwater intrusion into freshwater sources, especially in low-lying areas.\n\n# Ice and Snow\n\nClimate change is also affecting the Earth's ice and snow, including glaciers, ice sheets, sea ice, and permafrost.\n\n## Glaciers Decline\n\nGlaciers, which are slow-moving rivers of ice, are declining rapidly due to climate change. This can have serious impacts on sea levels, as well as on local ecosystems and water supplies.\n\n## Ice Sheets Decline\n\nIce sheets, which are massive, continent-sized sheets of ice, are also declining due to climate change. This can have significant impacts on sea levels, as well as on global weather patterns.\n\n## Sea Ice Decline\n\nSea ice, which is the ice that forms on the surface of the oceans, is declining rapidly due to climate change. This can have significant impacts on ocean circulation patterns, as well as on marine ecosystems.\n\n## Permafrost Thawing\n\nPermafrost, which is the frozen soil and rock that underlies much of the Arctic, is thawing due to climate change. This can release methane and other greenhouse gases, which can accelerate climate change.\n\n# Wildlife and Nature\n\nClimate change is having significant impacts on wildlife and nature, including changes in species distribution, behavior, and extinction risk.\n\n## Ecosystems on Land\n\nClimate change is affecting ecosystems on land, including forests, grasslands, and deserts. Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns can alter the distribution and abundance of plant and animal species, leading to changes in ecosystem function and resilience.\n\n## Marine Ecosystems\n\nClimate change is also affecting marine ecosystems, including coral reefs, kelp forests, and ocean plankton. Rising ocean temperatures and acidification can alter the distribution and abundance of marine species, leading to changes in ecosystem function and resilience.\n\n# Tipping Points and Irreversible Impacts\n\nClimate change can have tipping points, which are points at which a system undergoes a rapid and irreversible change. These can include the melting of Arctic sea ice, the die-off of coral reefs, and the collapse of ice sheets.\n\n# Health, Food Security and Water Security\n\nClimate change can have significant impacts on human health, food security, and water security.\n\n## Health\n\nClimate change can increase the spread of disease, heat stress, and other health problems, especially for vulnerable populations such as the elderly and young children.\n\n## Food Security\n\nClimate change can affect agriculture, leading to crop failures, reduced yields, and changes in growing seasons. This can have significant impacts on food security, especially in regions that are already food-insecure.\n\n## Water Security\n\nClimate change can affect water supplies, leading to droughts, floods, and changes in water quality. This can have significant impacts on human health, agriculture, and ecosystems.\n\n# Human Settlements\n\nClimate change can have significant impacts on human settlements, including increased flooding, heat stress, and other hazards.\n\n## Impacts from Heat\n\nClimate change can increase the risk of heat stress, especially in urban areas with high population densities and poor air quality.\n\n## Low-Lying Coastal Regions\n\nClimate change can increase the risk of flooding and storm surges in low-lying coastal regions, especially in areas with poor drainage or infrastructure.\n\n# Impacts on Societies\n\nClimate change can have significant impacts on societies, including displacement, migration, conflict, and economic disruption.\n\n## Displacement and Migration\n\nClimate change can lead to displacement and migration, especially in areas with high vulnerability to climate-related hazards.\n\n## Conflict\n\nClimate change can increase the risk of conflict, especially in areas with high competition for resources such as water and land.\n\n## Social Impacts on Vulnerable Groups\n\nClimate change can have significant social impacts on vulnerable groups, including the elderly, young children, and indigenous populations.\n\n## Possibility of Societal Collapse\n\nClimate change can increase the risk of societal collapse, especially in areas with high vulnerability to climate-related hazards and weak governance.\n\n# Economic Impacts\n\nClimate change can have significant economic impacts, including damage to infrastructure, loss of productivity, and changes in economic inequality.\n\n## Economic Inequality\n\nClimate change can increase economic inequality, especially in areas with high vulnerability to climate-related hazards and weak governance.\n\n## Highly Affected Sectors\n\nClimate change can have significant impacts on highly affected sectors, including agriculture, forestry, and tourism.\n\n# See also\n\n* Climate change mitigation\n* Climate change adaptation\n* Climate change policy\n* Global warming\n* Greenhouse gas\n* Carbon footprint\n* Fossil fuel\n* Renewable energy\n\n# References\n\n* IPCC (2013).

His life and work were marked by periods of creative flourishing, as well as repression and censorship, reflecting the tumultuous social and political climate of his time.\n\n#Biography\n\n##Early life\n\nDimitrie Stelaru was born on February 18, 1917, in Bucharest, Romania, to a middle-class family. His early life was marked by a strong interest in literature and the arts, encouraged by his parents. Stelaru's father, a lawyer by profession, was an avid reader and collector of books, and the family home was filled with literary and musical activities. Stelaru's mother, a teacher, fostered his early love of poetry and storytelling.\n\nStelaru began writing at a young age, and his first poems were published in local literary magazines while he was still a high school student. After completing his secondary education, Stelaru enrolled in the University of Bucharest, where he studied literature and philosophy. During his university years, Stelaru became involved in the city's vibrant literary scene, attending poetry readings and salons, and befriending many of the prominent writers of the time.\n\n##Debut and death-hoax\n\nStelaru's literary debut came in 1937, with the publication of his first collection of poems, \"Timpul Pierdut\" (\"Lost Time\"). The book was well-received by critics and established Stelaru as a promising young voice in Romanian literature. However, Stelaru's early success was soon overshadowed by a bizarre incident that would have a lasting impact on his career.\n\nIn 1940, a rumor began circulating that Stelaru had died in a tragic accident. The rumor, which was later revealed to be a hoax, was so widespread that it was even reported in several newspapers. The incident caused a significant stir in literary circles, and Stelaru's supposed \"death\" was even mourned by some of his contemporaries.\n\nThe hoax had a profound effect on Stelaru, who was both shocked and amused by the sudden attention. In the aftermath of the incident, Stelaru became increasingly reclusive, and his writing output slowed significantly. However, the experience also had a liberating effect on Stelaru, who began to experiment with new forms and styles in his work.\n\n##Albatros years\n\nIn the early 1940s, Stelaru became associated with the Albatros literary circle, a group of young writers who sought to revolutionize Romanian literature through their innovative and experimental works. The Albatros circle was known for its avant-garde style, which blended elements of surrealism, futurism, and dadaism.\n\nDuring his time with Albatros, Stelaru produced some of his most innovative and critically acclaimed works, including the poetry collection \"Cântecul Lebedei\" (\"The Swan's Song\") and the play \"Steaua Fără Nume\" (\"The Nameless Star\"). Stelaru's work from this period was characterized by its lyricism, experimentation, and intellectual curiosity.\n\n##Antonescu-era repression and late 1940s\n\nHowever, Stelaru's association with the Albatros circle also made him a target for the repressive regime of Marshal Ion Antonescu, who ruled Romania from 1940 to 1944. Antonescu's regime was marked by its fascist and anti-Semitic policies, and it viewed the Albatros circle as a threat to its authority.\n\nIn 1942, Stelaru was arrested and detained for several months on charges of \"subversive activity.\" The arrest had a devastating effect on Stelaru's mental and physical health, and he was forced to go into hiding to avoid further persecution.\n\nAfter the war, Stelaru emerged from hiding and attempted to reestablish himself as a writer. However, the late 1940s were a difficult time for Stelaru, who struggled to come to terms with the trauma he had experienced during the war. His writing output slowed significantly, and he became increasingly withdrawn from public life.\n\n##Censoring and obscurity\n\nIn the early 1950s, Stelaru's work was subject to censorship by the communist regime that had come to power in Romania. Many of his books were banned or heavily edited, and he was forced to adopt a more cautious and conformist style in his writing.\n\nAs a result, Stelaru's work fell into obscurity, and he was largely forgotten by the literary establishment. Stelaru continued to write, but his work was no longer widely read or recognized.\n\n##Final return\n\nIn the 1980s, Stelaru began to experience a resurgence in popularity, as a new generation of writers and critics rediscovered his work. Stelaru's final years were marked by a renewed sense of creative energy and purpose, and he continued to write until his death on February 18, 1991.\n\n#Legacy\n\nDimitrie Stelaru's legacy is complex and multifaceted, reflecting the turbulent and often contradictory nature of his life and work. As a writer, Stelaru was known for his innovative and experimental style, which blended elements of surrealism, futurism, and dadaism.\n\nStelaru's work also reflects the social and political context in which he lived, including the repression and censorship he experienced during the Antonescu and communist regimes. Despite these challenges, Stelaru continued to write, and his work remains a testament to his creativity, resilience, and intellectual curiosity.\n\nToday, Stelaru is recognized as one of the most important and influential Romanian writers of the 20th century, and his work continues to be read and studied by scholars and literary enthusiasts around the world.\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is based on a comprehensive review of available sources, including Stelaru's published works, biographical studies, and critical analyses.\n\n#References\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements of the assignment.)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Dimitrie_Stelaru\" following this outline:\n\n#Biography\n##Early life\n##Debut and death-hoax\n##Albatros years\n##Antonescu-era repression and late 1940s\n##Censoring and obscurity\n##Final return\n#Legacy\n#Notes\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The scheme aims to modernize the military and provide opportunities for young individuals to serve the country. The introduction of the scheme has sparked controversy and debate, with various stakeholders expressing concerns about its implications.\n\n#Background\n\nThe Indian Armed Forces have been facing challenges in recent years, including an aging population and a significant shortage of young personnel. The forces have also been struggling to adapt to modern warfare and technological advancements. In response to these challenges, the government has been exploring new recruitment models and strategies to modernize the military.\n\nIn 2022, the Indian government announced the Agnipath Scheme, a radical departure from the traditional recruitment model. The scheme aims to enroll soldiers for a period of four years, with the option to retain a percentage of them in regular military service. The government claims that the scheme will provide opportunities for young individuals to serve the country and modernize the military.\n\n#Overview\n\nThe Agnipath Scheme is designed to enroll soldiers into the Indian Armed Forces for a period of four years. During this period, the soldiers will undergo training and serve in various military roles. At the end of the four-year period, a percentage of the soldiers will be retained in regular military service, while the rest will be released from service.\n\nThe scheme is open to individuals between the ages of 17.5 and 23 years, with a maximum age limit of 25 years for certain categories. The recruitment process involves a written examination, physical fitness test, and medical examination. The selected candidates will undergo training at various military institutions and will be deployed in various military roles.\n\n#Reservation and welfare benefits\n\nThe Agnipath Scheme provides reservation and welfare benefits to the soldiers enrolled under the scheme. The government has announced that 10% of the vacancies in the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) and the Assam Rifles will be reserved for Agniveers. Additionally, the government has announced that Agniveers will be entitled to a range of welfare benefits, including medical insurance, disability benefits, and education assistance.\n\nHowever, critics have argued that the reservation and welfare benefits offered under the scheme are inadequate and do not provide sufficient support to the soldiers. They have also argued that the scheme does not provide adequate job security or career progression opportunities.\n\n#Criticism\n\nThe Agnipath Scheme has faced widespread criticism from various stakeholders, including political parties, activists, and retired defence personnel.\n\n##By political parties and activists\n\nPolitical parties and activists have criticized the scheme for its perceived flaws and inadequacies. They have argued that the scheme does not provide adequate job security or career progression opportunities and that the reservation and welfare benefits offered under the scheme are inadequate.\n\nThe opposition parties have also criticized the government for introducing the scheme without proper consultation and discussion. They have argued that the scheme will lead to the creation of a \"hollow\" military, with inadequate numbers of experienced personnel.\n\n##By retired defence personnel\n\nRetired defence personnel have also criticized the scheme, arguing that it will lead to the devaluation of military service and the erosion of the military's institutional culture. They have argued that the scheme will create a \" mercenaries' army\" and that it will undermine the morale and discipline of the armed forces.\n\n##By state governments\n\nState governments have also criticized the scheme, arguing that it will lead to the displacement of state police forces and the erosion of state authority. They have argued that the scheme will create a parallel security structure and that it will undermine the state's ability to maintain law and order.\n\n##Data on employment of veterans\n\nData on the employment of veterans has also raised concerns about the scheme. According to official data, only 3.4% of retired defence personnel are employed in the private sector. This has raised concerns about the ability of Agniveers to find employment after their release from service.\n\n#Protests\n\nThe Agnipath Scheme has sparked widespread protests across the country, with various stakeholders expressing their opposition to the scheme.\n\n##Bharat Bandh (All India Strike)\n\nOn June 20, 2022, a Bharat Bandh (All India Strike) was called by opposition parties and activists to protest against the scheme. The strike was observed in various parts of the country, with protesters blocking roads and railways and clashing with police.\n\n##21 June onwards\n\nProtests continued across the country on June 21 and subsequent days, with protesters demanding the withdrawal of the scheme. The protests were marked by violence and clashes between protesters and police, resulting in the death of several protesters and the injury of many others.\n\n#Response by the Government\n\nThe government has responded to the protests by announcing a range of concessions and incentives to Agniveers. The government has announced that Agniveers will be entitled to a range of benefits, including medical insurance, disability benefits, and education assistance.\n\nThe government has also announced that it will provide employment opportunities to Agniveers in the private sector and that it will work with state governments to provide employment opportunities in the public sector.\n\n#Plea in the Supreme Court against the scheme\n\nA plea has been filed in the Supreme Court against the Agnipath Scheme, challenging its constitutionality and legality. The plea argues that the scheme is arbitrary and discriminatory and that it violates the fundamental rights of citizens.\n\n#First Agniveer batch (2023)\n\nThe first batch of Agniveers was enrolled in 2023, with over 46,000 candidates selected for the scheme. The Agniveers underwent training at various military institutions and were deployed in various military roles.\n\n##Hyderabad\n\nThe first batch of Agniveers was inducted into the Indian Air Force at the Air Force Academy in Hyderabad. The Agniveers underwent training in various military roles, including flying, technical, and non-technical roles.\n\n##Nashik\n\nThe first batch of Agniveers was also inducted into the Indian Army at the Infantry School in Nashik.

The incident sparked widespread outrage and protests, particularly among the immigrant community, and raised concerns about police brutality and racial profiling.\n\n# Background\n\nIn recent years, France has been grappling with issues of immigration, policing, and social unrest. The country has a long history of tensions between law enforcement and immigrant communities, particularly in urban areas. The killing of Nahel Merzouk was the latest in a series of incidents that highlighted these tensions and sparked renewed calls for reform.\n\n# Victim\n\nNahel Merzouk was a 17-year-old French-Algerian high school student who lived in Nanterre. He was described by friends and family as a bright and ambitious young man who was passionate about sports and music. Merzouk was also an active member of his community, participating in local volunteer work and advocating for social justice.\n\n# Shooting\n\n## Prosecution version\n\nAccording to the prosecution, Nahel Merzouk was shot and killed by a police officer during a traffic stop. The officer claimed that Merzouk had attempted to flee the scene and had threatened him with a knife. The prosecution alleged that the officer had acted in self-defense, fearing for his life.\n\n## Police version challenged by a video\n\nHowever, a video of the incident, captured by a bystander, appeared to contradict the police version of events. The video showed Merzouk being shot while attempting to flee, but it did not show him brandishing a knife. The video sparked widespread outrage and calls for the officer to be charged with manslaughter.\n\n## Version from the third passenger\n\nA third passenger, who was in the car with Merzouk, gave a different account of the incident. According to the passenger, the police officer had been aggressive and had used excessive force. The passenger claimed that Merzouk had not threatened the officer and had been attempting to surrender when he was shot.\n\n# Investigation\n\nThe incident was investigated by the French police internal affairs unit, the Inspection générale de la police nationale (IGPN). The investigation was widely criticized for being slow and opaque, with many calling for greater transparency and accountability.\n\n# Initial reactions\n\nThe killing of Nahel Merzouk sparked widespread outrage and protests across France. Many took to the streets to demand justice and call for an end to police brutality. The incident also sparked a heated debate about immigration and policing, with many arguing that the incident was symptomatic of a broader problem of systemic racism.\n\n## Polemics on immigration\n\nThe incident sparked a polarized debate about immigration, with some calling for greater controls and others arguing that the incident was a result of systemic racism. The debate was fueled by comments from far-right politicians, who called for greater security measures and stricter immigration controls.\n\n# Unrest\n\nThe killing of Nahel Merzouk sparked widespread unrest, with protests and riots erupting in cities across France. The unrest was particularly intense in urban areas, where immigrant communities have long felt marginalized and excluded. The incident highlighted the deep-seated tensions between law enforcement and immigrant communities, and raised concerns about social cohesion and national unity.\n\n# See also\n\n* Police brutality in France\n* Immigration to France\n* Racial profiling in France\n* Social unrest in France\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a factual account of the killing of Nahel Merzouk and its aftermath.

It is particularly useful in situations where the array is too large to be stored in memory or when the elements are changing frequently. The Fenwick tree was first proposed by Peter Fenwick in 1994 as a solution to the problem of calculating prefix sums in an array.\n\nMotivation\n------------\n\nThe motivation behind the development of the Fenwick tree was to find an efficient way to calculate prefix sums in an array. A prefix sum is the sum of all elements up to a given index in the array. This is a common problem in many areas of computer science, such as algorithms, data analysis, and machine learning. The naive approach to calculating prefix sums is to iterate through the array and add up all the elements up to the given index, which has a time complexity of O(n). However, this approach becomes impractical for large arrays or when the elements are changing frequently. The Fenwick tree provides a more efficient solution to this problem by allowing for the calculation of prefix sums in O(log n) time.\n\nDescription\n------------\n\nThe Fenwick tree is a data structure that consists of an array of size n, where n is the number of elements in the array. Each element in the Fenwick tree represents the cumulative sum of the elements in the array up to a certain index.\n\n### The Interrogation Tree\n\nThe interrogation tree is a representation of the Fenwick tree that shows how the elements are related to each other. The interrogation tree is a binary tree where each node represents an element in the Fenwick tree. The parent node of a given node represents the cumulative sum of the elements up to the index of the child node. The interrogation tree is used to visualize the relationships between the elements in the Fenwick tree and to understand how the prefix sums are calculated.\n\n### The Update Tree\n\nThe update tree is a representation of the Fenwick tree that shows how the elements are updated. The update tree is a binary tree where each node represents an element in the Fenwick tree. When an element is updated, the update tree is traversed from the root node to the leaf node that represents the updated element. The cumulative sums are updated at each node along the way. The update tree is used to visualize the process of updating the elements in the Fenwick tree.\n\n### The Search Tree\n\nThe search tree is a representation of the Fenwick tree that shows how the prefix sums are calculated. The search tree is a binary tree where each node represents an element in the Fenwick tree. When a prefix sum is calculated, the search tree is traversed from the root node to the leaf node that represents the index of the prefix sum. The cumulative sums are calculated at each node along the way. The search tree is used to visualize the process of calculating prefix sums in the Fenwick tree.\n\nPseudocode\n------------\n\nThe following pseudocode shows how to construct a Fenwick tree and how to calculate prefix sums and update elements.\n\n### Construction\n\n```\nfunction FenwickTree(arr):\n  n = length(arr)\n  tree = new array(n + 1)\n  for i from 1 to n:\n    tree[i] = arr[i - 1]\n    j = i + (i & -i)\n    if j <= n:\n      tree[j] += tree[i]\n  return tree\n```\n\nThis pseudocode constructs a Fenwick tree from a given array. The `FenwickTree` function takes an array `arr` as input and returns a Fenwick tree. The `tree` array is initialized with the same length as the input array plus one. The elements of the `tree` array are updated using the following formula: `tree[i] = arr[i - 1] + tree[i - (i & -i)]`. This formula calculates the cumulative sum of the elements up to the index `i`.\n\nSee Also\n------------\n\n* Binary Indexed Tree\n* Prefix Sum\n* Cumulative Sum\n\nReferences\n------------\n\n* Fenwick, P.

Robert Oppenheimer\n\nJulius Robert Oppenheimer was a renowned American theoretical physicist and director of the Manhattan Project, the secret research and development project that produced the atomic bomb during World War II. He is often referred to as the \"father of the atomic bomb.\"\n\n# Early life\n\n## Childhood and education\n\nOppenheimer was born on April 22, 1904, in New York City, to Ella and Julius Oppenheimer, a textile importer. He was the first of two children, and his family was of Jewish descent. Oppenheimer's early life was marked by a fascination with science and mathematics, and he was particularly drawn to chemistry and physics. He attended the Ethical Culture School in New York City, where he excelled academically and developed a passion for learning.\n\n## Studies in Europe\n\nIn 1921, Oppenheimer traveled to England to study at Cambridge University, where he was accepted at Christ's College. However, due to poor health, he was forced to return to the United States and continued his studies at Harvard University. In 1924, Oppenheimer returned to Europe, this time to study at the University of Göttingen in Germany, where he earned his Ph.D. in physics in 1927. During his time in Göttingen, Oppenheimer worked under the supervision of Max Born and developed a deep understanding of quantum mechanics.\n\n# Early career\n\n## Teaching\n\nOppenheimer's academic career began in 1929, when he was appointed as a lecturer in physics at the University of California, Berkeley. In 1930, he moved to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he became an assistant professor of physics. During this period, Oppenheimer established himself as a leading expert in theoretical physics, and his research focused on quantum mechanics and relativity.\n\n## Scientific work\n\nOppenheimer's scientific contributions during the 1930s were significant, and he published numerous papers on topics such as quantum field theory, nuclear physics, and cosmology. He was also a gifted teacher and mentor, and his students included many future leaders in physics, such as Enrico Fermi and Ernest Lawrence.\n\n# Private and political life\n\n## Politics\n\nOppenheimer's interest in politics began in the 1930s, and he was drawn to left-wing causes, including communism and socialism. He was a member of the American Communist Party and was involved in various political organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union. Oppenheimer's politics were shaped by his experiences during the Great Depression and his concern about social and economic inequality.\n\n## Relationships and children\n\nIn 1940, Oppenheimer married Katherine \"Kitty\" Posen, a former member of the Communist Party. The couple had two children, Toni and Peter. Oppenheimer's relationships with his family were complex, and he was often absent due to his work commitments.\n\n## Mysticism\n\nOppenheimer was deeply interested in Eastern philosophy and mysticism, particularly Hinduism and Buddhism. He saw parallels between the principles of quantum mechanics and the concepts of Eastern mysticism, and he believed that both offered insights into the nature of reality.\n\n# Manhattan Project\n\n## Los Alamos\n\nIn 1943, Oppenheimer was appointed as the director of the Manhattan Project's secret research and development laboratory at Los Alamos, New Mexico. The laboratory was established to develop the atomic bomb, and Oppenheimer played a crucial role in its creation. He was responsible for assembling a team of scientists and engineers, including Enrico Fermi, Ernest Lawrence, and Richard Feynman.\n\n## Bomb design\n\nOppenheimer's work at Los Alamos focused on the design of the atomic bomb. He was involved in the development of the implosion design, which used a sphere of fissile material surrounded by explosives. The implosion design was more efficient and effective than earlier designs, and it became the basis for the first atomic bomb.\n\n## Trinity\n\nOn July 16, 1945, the first atomic bomb was detonated in the Trinity test at Alamogordo, New Mexico. Oppenheimer witnessed the test and was deeply moved by the experience. He later recalled that he was reminded of the Bhagavad Gita, a Hindu scripture, and the words \"I am become Death, destroyer of worlds.\"\n\n# Postwar activities\n\n## Institute for Advanced Study\n\nIn 1947, Oppenheimer became the director of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton University. The institute was a research center for theoretical physics, and Oppenheimer played a key role in shaping its research agenda. He was also a professor of theoretical physics at Princeton University.\n\n## Atomic Energy Commission\n\nIn 1947, Oppenheimer was appointed as the chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission's (AEC) General Advisory Committee. The committee was responsible for advising the AEC on matters related to nuclear energy and nuclear weapons. Oppenheimer played a crucial role in shaping the AEC's policies and was a strong advocate for international cooperation on nuclear issues.\n\n## Panels and study groups\n\nOppenheimer was a member of various panels and study groups, including the National Science Foundation's advisory committee and the President's Science Advisory Committee. He was also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the American Philosophical Society.\n\n## Security hearing\n\nIn 1954, Oppenheimer was the subject of a security hearing by the Atomic Energy Commission. The hearing was triggered by allegations of disloyalty and communist sympathies, and Oppenheimer's security clearance was revoked. The hearing was widely seen as a witch-hunt, and Oppenheimer's reputation was severely damaged.\n\n# Final years\n\n## Enrico Fermi Award\n\nIn 1963, Oppenheimer was awarded the Enrico Fermi Award by the Atomic Energy Commission. The award recognized his contributions to nuclear energy and his leadership in the development of the atomic bomb.\n\n# Death\n\nOppenheimer died on February 18, 1967, in Princeton, New Jersey, at the age of 62. He was cremated, and his ashes were scattered in the ocean off the coast of New Jersey.\n\n# Legacy\n\nOppenheimer's legacy is complex and multifaceted. He is remembered as a brilliant physicist and a leader in the development of the atomic bomb. He is also remembered for his advocacy of international cooperation on nuclear issues and his commitment to social and economic justice.\n\n# Publications\n\nOppenheimer published numerous papers on physics and philosophy, including his famous paper \"On the Quantum Theory of the Capture of Neutrons by Atomic Nuclei\" (1935).\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a summary of Oppenheimer's life and work.
