The sixth named storm and third hurricane of the 2022 Atlantic hurricane season, Fiona caused widespread damage and flooding, particularly in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic.\n\nMeteorological History\n--------------------\n\nFiona originated from a tropical wave that emerged from the west coast of Africa on September 7, 2022. The wave moved westward across the tropical Atlantic, gradually developing a closed circulation and convection. By September 14, the system had strengthened into a tropical depression, located about 1,000 miles east of the Lesser Antilles.\n\nOver the next few days, the depression intensified into a tropical storm, earning the name Fiona. The storm moved westward, passing just south of the island of Guadeloupe on September 16. Fiona continued to strengthen, reaching hurricane strength on September 17, as it moved towards Puerto Rico.\n\nFiona made landfall in Puerto Rico on September 18, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall to the island. The hurricane then moved northwestward, passing over the Dominican Republic on September 19. After affecting the Turks and Caicos Islands, Fiona turned northward, moving towards Bermuda and Eastern Canada.\n\nPreparations\n-------------\n\nIn anticipation of Fiona's arrival, several islands in the Caribbean issued tropical storm watches and warnings. Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and the Turks and Caicos Islands all declared a state of emergency, with evacuation orders issued for certain areas.\n\nIn Bermuda, the government issued a hurricane warning, with residents advised to stock up on supplies and prepare for the worst. In Eastern Canada, the Canadian Hurricane Centre issued a tropical storm watch for parts of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland.\n\nImpact\n--------\n\n### Guadeloupe\n\nFiona passed just south of Guadeloupe on September 16, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall to the island. The winds caused power outages, with over 10,000 households left without electricity. The heavy rainfall also caused flooding, particularly in the island's capital, Basse-Terre.\n\n### Puerto Rico\n\nFiona made landfall in Puerto Rico on September 18, bringing catastrophic winds and rainfall to the island. The hurricane caused widespread power outages, with over 1 million households left without electricity. The heavy rainfall also caused severe flooding, particularly in the island's central and southern regions.\n\nThe storm surge caused coastal flooding, particularly in the city of Ponce, where several buildings were inundated with water. The hurricane also caused significant damage to the island's agricultural sector, with over 50% of the island's crops destroyed.\n\n### Dominican Republic\n\nFiona passed over the Dominican Republic on September 19, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall to the country. The hurricane caused widespread power outages, with over 500,000 households left without electricity. The heavy rainfall also caused severe flooding, particularly in the country's capital, Santo Domingo.\n\nThe storm surge caused coastal flooding, particularly in the city of Punta Cana, where several hotels and resorts were inundated with water. The hurricane also caused significant damage to the country's agricultural sector, with over 30% of the country's crops destroyed.\n\n### Turks and Caicos\n\nFiona passed over the Turks and Caicos Islands on September 20, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall to the islands. The hurricane caused widespread power outages, with over 10,000 households left without electricity. The heavy rainfall also caused severe flooding, particularly in the island's capital, Grand Turk.\n\n### Antigua\n\nFiona passed just north of Antigua on September 20, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall to the island. The winds caused power outages, with over 5,000 households left without electricity. The heavy rainfall also caused flooding, particularly in the island's capital, St. John's.\n\n### Bermuda\n\nFiona passed just west of Bermuda on September 23, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall to the island. The hurricane caused widespread power outages, with over 20,000 households left without electricity. The heavy rainfall also caused severe flooding, particularly in the island's capital, Hamilton.\n\n### Eastern Canada\n\nFiona made landfall in Eastern Canada on September 24, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall to the region. The hurricane caused widespread power outages, with over 50,000 households left without electricity. The heavy rainfall also caused severe flooding, particularly in the province of Nova Scotia.\n\nAftermath\n----------\n\n### Puerto Rico\n\nThe aftermath of Fiona's impact on Puerto Rico was severe, with over 1 million households left without electricity. The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) worked to restore power, but the process was slow, with many areas left without electricity for weeks.\n\nThe Puerto Rican government established a relief fund to help those affected by the hurricane, with over $1 million donated in the first week. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) also deployed personnel to the island to assist with relief efforts.\n\n### Dominican Republic\n\nThe aftermath of Fiona's impact on the Dominican Republic was also severe, with over 500,000 households left without electricity. The Dominican Republic's national emergency commission (COE) worked to restore power, but the process was slow, with many areas left without electricity for weeks.\n\nThe Dominican government established a relief fund to help those affected by the hurricane, with over $500,000 donated in the first week. The international community also provided assistance, with several countries donating aid and personnel to help with relief efforts.\n\nRetirement\n----------\n\nDue to the severity of the damage and loss of life caused by Fiona, the name was retired from the list of Atlantic hurricane names in 2023. The name will no longer be used for any future Atlantic hurricanes.\n\nSee Also\n--------\n\n* 2022 Atlantic hurricane season\n* List of Category 4 Atlantic hurricanes\n* List of retired Atlantic hurricane names\n\nExternal Links\n---------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Hurricane_Fiona\" following this outline:\n\n#Meteorological history\n#Preparations\n#Impact\n##Guadeloupe\n##Puerto Rico\n##Dominican Republic\n##Turks and Caicos\n##Antigua\n##Bermuda\n##Eastern Canada\n#Aftermath\n##Puerto Rico\n##Dominican Republic\n#Retirement\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Following the success of these albums, Swift announced that she would be re-recording her older albums after a highly publicized dispute with her former record label, Big Machine Records, over the ownership of her master recordings.\n\nIn 2021, Swift released Fearless (Taylor's Version) and Red (Taylor's Version), which featured re-recorded versions of her 2008 album Fearless and 2012 album Red, respectively.

The case involves allegations of election obstruction, conspiracy, and other charges related to Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results.\n\n# Background\n\n## Accusations of electoral fraud and attempts to overturn the election\n\nFollowing the 2020 presidential election, Trump and his allies made numerous claims of electoral fraud and irregularities, despite a lack of evidence to support these claims. Trump also took various steps to attempt to overturn the election results, including filing lawsuits, pressuring state officials, and urging his supporters to take action.\n\n## January 6 Capitol attack and investigations\n\nOn January 6, 2021, a mob of Trump supporters stormed the United States Capitol, resulting in violence, injuries, and deaths. The attack led to widespread condemnation and investigations into the events surrounding the incident. In the aftermath, Trump's actions and statements leading up to the attack were scrutinized, and he was ultimately impeached by the House of Representatives for inciting an insurrection.\n\n# Original indictment and arraignment\n\nOn August 1, 2023, a federal grand jury indicted Trump on charges related to his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. The original indictment included four counts: conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, obstruction of an official proceeding, and conspiracy against rights. Trump was arraigned on August 3, 2023, and pleaded not guilty to all charges.\n\n# Superseding indictment and arraignment\n\nOn September 12, 2023, a superseding indictment was filed, adding new charges and expanding on the original allegations. The superseding indictment included additional details about Trump's alleged involvement in a conspiracy to overturn the election results. Trump was re-arraigned on September 15, 2023, and again pleaded not guilty to all charges.\n\n# Statements in the indictment\n\n## Allegations and statements\n\nThe indictment alleges that Trump and his co-conspirators engaged in a multifaceted scheme to overturn the 2020 presidential election results. According to the indictment, Trump and his associates made false claims of electoral fraud, pressured state officials, and attempted to intimidate or coerce individuals into supporting their efforts.\n\n## Count One: Conspiracy to defraud the United States\n\nThe first count of the indictment alleges that Trump and his co-conspirators conspired to defraud the United States by attempting to overturn the election results. The indictment claims that Trump and his associates knowingly and intentionally made false statements and engaged in deceptive conduct to achieve their goal.\n\n## Further allegations and statements\n\nThe indictment also alleges that Trump and his co-conspirators attempted to intimidate or coerce individuals into supporting their efforts to overturn the election results. According to the indictment, Trump and his associates made threats and engaged in other forms of intimidation to pressure individuals into backing their claims.\n\n## Count Two: Conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding\n\nThe second count of the indictment alleges that Trump and his co-conspirators conspired to obstruct an official proceeding by attempting to disrupt the certification of the election results. The indictment claims that Trump and his associates knowingly and intentionally took steps to delay or prevent the certification process.\n\n## Count Three: Obstruction of an official proceeding\n\nThe third count of the indictment alleges that Trump and his co-conspirators obstructed an official proceeding by attempting to disrupt the certification of the election results. The indictment claims that Trump and his associates knowingly and intentionally took steps to delay or prevent the certification process.\n\n## Count Four: Conspiracy against rights\n\nThe fourth count of the indictment alleges that Trump and his co-conspirators conspired against the rights of citizens by attempting to deprive them of their right to vote and have their votes counted. The indictment claims that Trump and his associates knowingly and intentionally took steps to disenfranchise voters and undermine the integrity of the electoral process.\n\n# Co-conspirators\n\nThe indictment names several co-conspirators, including former Trump advisors and associates. The co-conspirators are alleged to have played various roles in the scheme to overturn the election results.\n\n# Pretrial proceedings\n\n## Initial timetable\n\nFollowing the indictment, the court established an initial timetable for pretrial proceedings. The timetable included deadlines for the exchange of discovery materials, the filing of pretrial motions, and the conduct of depositions.\n\n## Protective orders and security measures\n\nDue to the sensitive nature of the case, the court has issued protective orders and implemented security measures to safeguard the integrity of the proceedings. The protective orders restrict the disclosure of certain information and materials, while the security measures include restrictions on access to the courtroom and the use of electronic devices.\n\n## Other pre-trial motions\n\nThe parties have filed various pretrial motions, including motions to dismiss, motions to suppress, and motions to compel discovery. The court has ruled on some of these motions, while others remain pending.\n\n## Immunity dispute\n\nA dispute has arisen regarding the immunity of certain witnesses. The prosecution has sought to compel the testimony of certain witnesses, while the defense has argued that these witnesses are entitled to immunity.\n\n### Appeals\n\nThe immunity dispute has led to appeals to higher courts. The appeals court has ruled on some aspects of the dispute, while others remain pending.\n\n### Proceedings resulting from the immunity decision\n\nFollowing the appeals court's ruling, the trial court has conducted further proceedings to resolve the immunity dispute. The proceedings have included hearings and the submission of additional briefs.\n\n## Post-immunity timetable\n\nFollowing the resolution of the immunity dispute, the court has established a revised timetable for pretrial proceedings. The revised timetable includes new deadlines for the exchange of discovery materials, the filing of pretrial motions, and the conduct of depositions.\n\n# Potential witnesses and evidence\n\n## Prosecution\n\nThe prosecution is expected to call a range of witnesses, including former Trump advisors and associates, government officials, and experts. The prosecution is also expected to introduce various forms of evidence, including documents, emails, and recordings.\n\n## Defense\n\nThe defense is expected to call its own witnesses, including Trump himself, as well as other former advisors and associates. The defense is also expected to introduce its own evidence, including documents, emails, and recordings.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## Defendant\n\nTrump has denied all charges and maintains that the prosecution is a \"witch hunt.\" Trump has also attacked the integrity of the prosecution and the court.\n\n## Republicans in support of the indictment\n\nSome Republicans have expressed support for the indictment, arguing that Trump's actions were unacceptable and that he must be held accountable.\n\n## Republicans opposed to the indictment\n\nMany Republicans have opposed the indictment, arguing that it is a partisan attack on Trump and that the prosecution is motivated by politics.\n\n## Democrats in support of the indictment\n\nDemocrats have largely supported the indictment, arguing that Trump's actions were a serious threat to democracy and that he must be held accountable.\n\n# See also\n\n* 2020 United States presidential election\n* January 6 United States Capitol attack\n* Impeachment of Donald Trump\n* Federal prosecution of Donald Trump (classified documents case)\n\n# References\n\n## Footnotes\n\n## Citations\n\n## Works cited\n\n# External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Federal_prosecution_of_Donald_Trump_(election_obstruction_case)\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Accusations of electoral fraud and attempts to overturn the election\n##January 6 Capitol attack and investigations\n#Original indictment and arraignment\n#Superseding indictment and arraignment\n#Statements in the indictment\n##Allegations and statements\n##Count One: Conspiracy to defraud the United States\n##Further allegations and statements\n##Count Two: Conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding\n##Count Three: Obstruction of an official proceeding\n##Count Four: Conspiracy against rights\n#Co-conspirators\n#Pretrial proceedings\n##Initial timetable\n##Protective orders and security measures\n##Other pre-trial motions\n##Immunity dispute\n###Appeals\n###Proceedings resulting from the immunity decision\n##Post-immunity timetable\n#Potential witnesses and evidence\n##Prosecution\n##Defense\n#Reactions\n##Defendant\n##Republicans in support of the indictment\n##Republicans opposed to the indictment\n##Democrats in support of the indictment\n#See also\n#References\n##Footnotes\n##Citations\n##Works cited\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Bagley was a former CIA officer and author, best known for his work on counterintelligence and his involvement in several high-profile espionage cases during the Cold War. Bagley's career spanned over two decades, during which he worked closely with other notable figures in the intelligence community, including James Angleton and William King Harvey.\n\n#Early life and education\n\nTennent H. Bagley was born on February 20, 1925, in New York City. He grew up in a family of modest means and developed an interest in languages and international affairs from an early age. Bagley attended the Hotchkiss School in Lakeville, Connecticut, before enrolling at Yale University, where he studied Russian and Eastern European languages.\n\n#Career\n\nBagley joined the CIA in 1952, shortly after graduating from Yale. He began his career in the agency's Clandestine Service, working on operations related to Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. Bagley's language skills and knowledge of the region made him an asset to the agency, and he quickly rose through the ranks.\n\nIn the late 1950s, Bagley was assigned to the CIA's Berlin station, where he worked on counterintelligence operations against the KGB. It was during this time that he became involved in the case of Pyotr Popov, a Soviet military officer who had been recruited by the CIA.\n\n##Bagley's Analysis of the KGB-CIA War\n\nBagley's experience working on the Popov case and other counterintelligence operations gave him a unique perspective on the KGB-CIA war. He believed that the KGB was engaged in a systematic effort to penetrate and disrupt the CIA's operations, using a combination of human intelligence and technical means.\n\nBagley's analysis of the KGB's methods and motivations was shaped by his experiences working on the front lines of the Cold War. He believed that the KGB was willing to use any means necessary to achieve its objectives, including murder, blackmail, and betrayal.\n\n#The Popov Case\n\nPyotr Popov was a Soviet military officer who had been recruited by the CIA in the late 1950s. Popov provided the agency with valuable intelligence on the Soviet military, including information on the Soviet Union's nuclear capabilities.\n\nHowever, Popov's relationship with the CIA was complicated by his own personal demons. He was a heavy drinker and a womanizer, and his behavior often put him at risk of being discovered by the KGB.\n\nBagley was assigned to work with Popov, and he quickly became aware of the officer's vulnerabilities. Despite these risks, Bagley believed that Popov was a valuable asset, and he worked to protect him from the KGB's counterintelligence efforts.\n\n#The Golienewski Case\n\nMichal Goleniewski was a Polish intelligence officer who had defected to the West in the late 1950s. Goleniewski provided the CIA with valuable intelligence on the Soviet Union's intelligence operations, including information on the KGB's methods and personnel.\n\nHowever, Goleniewski's relationship with the CIA was complicated by his own personal agenda. He was a self-promoter who sought to use his intelligence to gain recognition and reward.\n\nBagley was skeptical of Goleniewski's motives, but he recognized the value of the intelligence he provided. He worked to verify Goleniewski's information and to use it to further the CIA's objectives.\n\n#The Nosenko Case\n\nYuri Nosenko was a KGB officer who had defected to the West in the early 1960s. Nosenko provided the CIA with valuable intelligence on the KGB's operations, including information on the agency's methods and personnel.\n\nHowever, Nosenko's relationship with the CIA was complicated by his own personal demons. He was a heavy drinker and a liar, and his behavior often put him at risk of being discovered by the KGB.\n\nBagley was assigned to work with Nosenko, and he quickly became aware of the officer's vulnerabilities. Despite these risks, Bagley believed that Nosenko was a valuable asset, and he worked to protect him from the KGB's counterintelligence efforts.\n\n##Nosenko and the \"Zepp\" Incident\n\nOne of the most notable incidents involving Nosenko was the \"Zepp\" affair. In 1962, Nosenko had provided the CIA with information on a KGB operation to assassinate a high-ranking Western official.\n\nHowever, the CIA's handling of the incident was botched, and the KGB was able to identify Nosenko as the source of the intelligence. Nosenko was recalled to Moscow, where he was interrogated and eventually imprisoned.\n\nBagley was deeply troubled by the CIA's handling of the Zepp incident. He believed that the agency had mishandled the intelligence and had put Nosenko's life at risk.\n\n##More Nosenko\n\nNosenko's relationship with the CIA continued to be complicated by his own personal demons. He was a heavy drinker and a liar, and his behavior often put him at risk of being discovered by the KGB.\n\nDespite these risks, Bagley believed that Nosenko was a valuable asset, and he worked to protect him from the KGB's counterintelligence efforts. However, the CIA's handling of Nosenko was ultimately flawed, and the officer was eventually imprisoned by the KGB.\n\n#The KITTY HAWK / Shadrin Case\n\nNikolai Shadrin was a Soviet sailor who had defected to the West in the late 1960s. Shadrin provided the CIA with valuable intelligence on the Soviet Navy, including information on the Soviet Union's naval capabilities.\n\nHowever, Shadrin's relationship with the CIA was complicated by his own personal agenda. He was a self-promoter who sought to use his intelligence to gain recognition and reward.\n\nBagley was assigned to work with Shadrin, and he quickly became aware of the sailor's vulnerabilities. Despite these risks, Bagley believed that Shadrin was a valuable asset, and he worked to protect him from the KGB's counterintelligence efforts.\n\n#Rebuttal to John L. Hart's HSCA testimony\n\nIn the 1970s, Bagley became embroiled in a controversy surrounding the CIA's handling of the Nosenko case. John L. Hart, a former CIA officer, had testified before the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) that the CIA had mishandled Nosenko's intelligence and had put the officer's life at risk.\n\nBagley rebutted Hart's testimony, arguing that the CIA had handled Nosenko's intelligence properly and had taken steps to protect the officer from the KGB's counterintelligence efforts.\n\n#Reactions to his Spy Wars book\n\nIn 2007, Bagley published a book on his experiences working in the CIA, titled \"Spy Wars: Moles, Mysteries, and Deadly Games.\" The book was widely reviewed, with many critics praising Bagley's insights into the world of espionage.\n\nHowever, some critics argued that Bagley's book was overly critical of the CIA and its handling of counterintelligence operations. Others argued that the book was too focused on Bagley's own personal experiences and did not provide a broader perspective on the CIA's role in the Cold War.\n\n#In popular culture\n\nBagley's experiences working in the CIA have been referenced in several popular culture works, including films and television shows. However, Bagley himself has not been portrayed in any major films or television shows.\n\n#Personal life\n\nBagley was married to a woman named Barbara, and the couple had two children together. Bagley was known to be a private person, and little is known about his personal life outside of his work in the CIA.\n\n#References", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Tennent_H._Bagley\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and education\n#Career\n#Bagley's Analysis of the KGB-CIA War\n#The Popov Case\n#The Golienewski Case\n#The Nosenko Case\n#Nosenko and the \"Zepp\" Incident\n#More Nosenko\n#The KITTY HAWK / Shadrin Case\n#Rebuttal to John L.

The film's narrative is woven around a complex web of characters, exploring themes of identity, morality, and the blurred lines between reality and fantasy.\n\nPlot\n-----\n\nThe film's plot revolves around Luke Anthony (Mammootty), a wealthy and influential businessman with a mysterious past. Luke's life takes a dramatic turn when he becomes embroiled in a series of events that challenge his perceptions of reality. As the story unfolds, Luke's true nature is revealed, and the audience is left to ponder the authenticity of his identity.\n\nThroughout the film, Luke's interactions with various characters, including his wife, daughter, and business associates, raise questions about his intentions and motivations. The narrative is layered with twists and turns, keeping the viewer engaged and guessing until the very end.\n\nCast\n-----\n\n* Mammootty as Luke Anthony\n* Bindu Panicker as Luke's mother\n* Kottayam Nazir as Luke's business associate\n* Jagadish as Luke's friend\n* Sanju Sivram as Luke's daughter\n* Grace Antony as Luke's wife\n\nProduction\n------------\n\n### Development\n\nThe idea for Rorschach was conceived by director Nisam Basheer, who drew inspiration from the Rorschach test, a psychological tool used to assess personality and emotional functioning. Basheer was fascinated by the concept of the test, which involves interpreting inkblots to reveal underlying thoughts and feelings. He saw parallels between the test and the human experience, where individuals present different versions of themselves to the world.\n\nBasheer collaborated with screenwriter Sameer Abdul to develop the script, which underwent several revisions before being finalized. The filmmakers worked closely with Mammootty to ensure that the lead character's complexities were accurately portrayed.\n\n### Filming\n\nPrincipal photography for Rorschach commenced in January 2018 and wrapped up in April of the same year. The film was shot on location in various parts of Kerala, with a focus on capturing the state's lush landscapes and vibrant culture.\n\nThe cinematography was handled by Nikhil S Praveen, who employed a range of techniques to create a visually stunning and atmospheric film. The camera work was highly praised for its innovative use of lighting, color palettes, and composition.\n\nMusic\n------\n\nThe original score for Rorschach was composed by Midhun Mukundan, who incorporated a range of genres, including electronic, rock, and classical music. The soundtrack features a mix of fast-paced and slow tracks, perfectly capturing the film's mood and tone.\n\nMarketing\n---------\n\nThe marketing campaign for Rorschach was launched in May 2018, with the release of a teaser trailer that generated significant buzz on social media. The trailer hinted at the film's complex narrative and Mammootty's intense performance, piquing the interest of audiences and critics alike.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the film's release, the cast and crew participated in various promotional events, including press conferences, interviews, and fan meets. The film's poster, designed by artist Collins Leophil, was widely shared and admired for its creativity and simplicity.\n\nRelease\n--------\n\n### Theatrical\n\nRorschach was released in theaters on October 5, 2018, to a mixed response from critics and audiences. While some reviewers praised the film's ambition and Mammootty's performance, others found the narrative confusing and the pacing uneven.\n\nDespite the initial mixed reaction, the film developed a cult following over time, with many viewers appreciating its complexity and themes. Rorschach became a topic of discussion on social media, with fans analyzing and interpreting the film's symbolism and motifs.\n\n### Home media\n\nRorschach was released on DVD and digital platforms in December 2018, allowing a wider audience to experience the film. The home media release included bonus features, such as deleted scenes and making-of documentaries, which provided insight into the film's production and creative process.\n\nReception\n----------\n\n### Box office\n\nRorschach performed moderately well at the box office, grossing approximately ₹20 crore (US$2.5 million) worldwide. While the film did not break any records, it was considered a commercial success given its modest budget and experimental nature.\n\n### Critical response\n\nRorschach received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising the film's ambition and others criticizing its narrative and pacing. Reviewers noted the film's technical achievements, including its cinematography and music, but were divided on the overall impact of the film.\n\nSome critics praised Mammootty's performance, citing his ability to convey complexity and depth. Others found the supporting cast to be underutilized, with some characters feeling underdeveloped or one-dimensional.\n\nIn conclusion, Rorschach is a thought-provoking and visually stunning film that challenges viewers to question their perceptions of reality. While it may not appeal to everyone, the film's ambition and themes make it a notable entry in Malayalam cinema.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nExternal links\n---------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Rorschach_(film)\" following this outline:\n\n#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production\n##Development\n##Filming\n#Music\n#Marketing\n#Release\n##Theatrical\n##Home media\n#Reception\n##Box office\n##Critical response\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The monument is inscribed with a set of ten guidelines or principles, written in eight different languages, intended to provide guidance for humanity in the event of a catastrophic event or global upheaval. The Guidestones have been the subject of much speculation, debate, and conspiracy theories since their construction in 1980.\n\n# History\n\n## Construction\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones were constructed in 1980 by a group of individuals who referred to themselves as the \"New World Order.\" The group, led by a man who went by the pseudonym R.C. Christian, approached the Elberton Granite Finishing Company with a proposal to build a monument that would serve as a guide for humanity in the event of a catastrophic event. The company agreed to build the monument, and construction began in 1979. The Guidestones were completed in 1980 and were unveiled on March 22, 1980.\n\n## Reaction\n\nThe reaction to the Georgia Guidestones was mixed. Some people saw the monument as a positive and uplifting message, while others were more skeptical. Many were concerned about the origins of the monument and the identity of the individuals who built it. Some conspiracy theories emerged, suggesting that the Guidestones were part of a larger plot to control the world or impose a new world order.\n\n## Destruction\n\nOn July 6, 2022, the Georgia Guidestones were severely damaged in a bombing attack. The explosion destroyed a significant portion of the monument, and the remaining sections were later demolished due to safety concerns. The bombing was widely condemned, and an investigation was launched to identify the perpetrators.\n\n### Aftermath\n\nThe destruction of the Georgia Guidestones sparked a range of reactions. Some people expressed sadness and loss, while others saw the event as a victory for those who opposed the monument and its perceived message. The destruction of the Guidestones also raised questions about the future of the site and the potential for rebuilding or replacement.\n\n# Description\n\n## Inscriptions\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones are inscribed with a set of ten guidelines or principles, written in eight different languages. The inscriptions are as follows:\n\n1. Maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature.\n2. Guide reproduction wisely – improving fitness and diversity.\n3. Unite humanity with a living new language.\n4. Rule passion – faith – tradition – and all things with tempered reason.\n5. Protect people and nations with fair laws and just courts.\n6. Let all nations rule internally resolving external disputes in a world court.\n7. Avoid petty laws and useless officials.\n8. Balance personal rights with social duties.\n9. Prize truth – beauty – love – seeking harmony with the infinite.\n10. Be not a cancer on the earth – Leave room for nature.\n\n## Explanatory tablet\n\nAn explanatory tablet, situated near the Guidestones, provides additional context and information about the monument. The tablet explains the origins of the Guidestones and the intentions of the individuals who built them.\n\n## Physical data\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones are made of granite and consist of four main stones, each weighing around 20 tons. The stones are arranged in a square formation, with each stone aligned with the four cardinal directions (north, south, east, and west). The stones are also aligned with the celestial bodies, including the sun, moon, and stars.\n\n## Guidestone languages\n\nThe inscriptions on the Georgia Guidestones are written in eight different languages: English, Spanish, Swahili, Hindi, Hebrew, Arabic, Chinese, and Russian.\n\n## Astronomical features\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones are designed to align with various celestial bodies and astronomical events. The stones are aligned with the rising and setting of the sun and moon, and the position of the stars in the night sky.\n\n# Interpretations\n\n## Conspiracy theories\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones have been the subject of numerous conspiracy theories over the years. Some of these theories suggest that the Guidestones are part of a larger plot to control the world or impose a new world order. Others believe that the Guidestones are a message from a secret society or a group of powerful individuals.\n\n# See also\n\n* New World Order\n* Conspiracy theories\n* Granite monuments\n* Astronomical alignments\n\n# References\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)\n\n# Further reading\n\n* The Georgia Guidestones: America's Most Mysterious Monument\n* The New World Order: A Book of the Georgia Guidestones\n* Conspiracy Theories: A Guide to the Georgia Guidestones\n\n# External links\n\n* Georgia Guidestones official website\n* Elberton Granite Finishing Company\n* New World Order conspiracy theories", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Georgia_Guidestones\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Construction\n##Reaction\n##Destruction\n###Aftermath\n#Description\n##Inscriptions\n##Explanatory tablet\n##Physical data\n##Guidestone languages\n##Astronomical features\n#Interpretations\n##Conspiracy theories\n#See also\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Anantarika-karma", "content": "#See also\n#References\n#Further reading\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Anantarika-karma\n\nAnantarika-karma is a term in Buddhist ethics that refers to a set of actions that are considered to be so severe and reprehensible that they lead to immediate and irreversible spiritual harm. These actions are seen as obstacles to spiritual growth and are considered to be a hindrance to the attainment of enlightenment. In this article, we will explore the concept of Anantarika-karma in detail, including its definition, types, and implications.\n\n# Definition and Meaning\n\nAnantarika-karma is a Sanskrit term that is composed of two words: \"anantarika\" and \"karma\". \"Anantarika\" means \"immediately\" or \"without interval\", while \"karma\" means \"action\" or \"deed\". Together, the term Anantarika-karma refers to actions that have immediate and irreparable consequences. In the context of Buddhist ethics, Anantarika-karma refers to actions that are so severe that they lead to immediate spiritual harm and create an insurmountable obstacle to spiritual growth.\n\n## Classification of Anantarika-karma\n\nIn Buddhist tradition, Anantarika-karma is classified into five categories:\n\n1. Matricide (killing one's mother)\n2. Patricide (killing one's father)\n3. Arhat-ocide (killing an Arhat, or a being who has attained enlightenment)\n4. Creating a schism in the Sangha (Buddhist community)\n5. Shedding the blood of a Buddha\n\nThese actions are considered to be so severe that they lead to immediate and irreversible spiritual harm. They are seen as obstacles to spiritual growth and are considered to be a hindrance to the attainment of enlightenment.\n\n## Implications of Anantarika-karma\n\nThe implications of Anantarika-karma are far-reaching and severe. According to Buddhist tradition, an individual who commits one of these actions will experience immediate and irreparable spiritual harm. This harm is seen as a hindrance to spiritual growth and is considered to be an obstacle to the attainment of enlightenment.\n\nIn addition, Anantarika-karma is seen as a cause of great suffering and negative consequences. An individual who commits one of these actions is said to experience great suffering and hardship in this life and in future lives. This suffering is seen as a direct result of the negative karma created by the action.\n\n# Causes and Conditions\n\nThe causes and conditions that lead to Anantarika-karma are complex and multifaceted. According to Buddhist tradition, Anantarika-karma is the result of a combination of factors, including:\n\n## Ignorance\n\nIgnorance is seen as a primary cause of Anantarika-karma. An individual who is ignorant of the true nature of reality and the consequences of their actions is more likely to commit an action that leads to Anantarika-karma.\n\n## Craving and Aversion\n\nCraving and aversion are also seen as causes of Anantarika-karma. An individual who is driven by strong craving or aversion is more likely to commit an action that leads to Anantarika-karma.\n\n## Negative Emotions\n\nNegative emotions such as anger, hatred, and jealousy are also seen as causes of Anantarika-karma. An individual who is consumed by negative emotions is more likely to commit an action that leads to Anantarika-karma.\n\n## Lack of Wisdom\n\nA lack of wisdom is also seen as a cause of Anantarika-karma. An individual who lacks wisdom and does not understand the true nature of reality is more likely to commit an action that leads to Anantarika-karma.\n\n# Consequences\n\nThe consequences of Anantarika-karma are severe and far-reaching. According to Buddhist tradition, an individual who commits one of these actions will experience:\n\n## Immediate Spiritual Harm\n\nAn individual who commits Anantarika-karma will experience immediate spiritual harm. This harm is seen as a hindrance to spiritual growth and is considered to be an obstacle to the attainment of enlightenment.\n\n## Negative Karma\n\nAn individual who commits Anantarika-karma will also create negative karma. This negative karma will lead to suffering and hardship in this life and in future lives.\n\n## Suffering and Hardship\n\nAn individual who commits Anantarika-karma will experience great suffering and hardship. This suffering is seen as a direct result of the negative karma created by the action.\n\n## Obstacle to Enlightenment\n\nAnantarika-karma is also seen as an obstacle to enlightenment. An individual who commits one of these actions will create a hindrance to spiritual growth and will be unable to attain enlightenment.\n\n# See also\n\n* Karma\n* Buddhist ethics\n* Five Precepts\n* Eightfold Path\n* Four Noble Truths\n\n# References\n\n# Further reading\n\n* Buddhaghosa.

It is the foundation of human civilization, providing resources, habitat, and a platform for various human activities. Land is a complex and dynamic entity, shaped by geological processes, climate, and human interventions. This article provides a comprehensive overview of land, covering its definition, etymology, physical science, features, layers, life science, human interactions, and environmental issues.\n\n# Definition\nLand is generally defined as the solid part of the Earth's surface, excluding oceans, seas, and other bodies of water. It is the terrestrial portion of the planet, encompassing continents, islands, and other landmasses. The concept of land is often contrasted with water, which covers approximately 71% of the Earth's surface.\n\n# Etymology\nThe word \"land\" has its roots in ancient languages, including Old English and Germanic. The term \"land\" is derived from the Proto-Germanic word \"*landiz,\" which is also the source of the Modern English word \"land.\" The word has evolved over time, with various meanings and connotations, including country, territory, and soil.\n\n# Physical Science\nLand is shaped by various physical processes that have been occurring over millions of years. These processes include geological formation, weathering, erosion, and deposition.\n\n## Formation\nThe formation of land is a complex process that involves the movement of tectonic plates, volcanic activity, and the creation of mountains. The Earth's crust is composed of several large plates that move relative to each other, resulting in the creation of mountains, volcanoes, and earthquakes. The process of plate tectonics has shaped the Earth's surface over millions of years, resulting in the formation of continents, oceans, and other landmasses.\n\n## Landmasses\nA landmass is a large area of land that is not covered by water. The Earth's surface is composed of seven continents, which are: Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America. Each continent is unique, with its own geography, climate, and features.\n\n## Terrain\nTerrain refers to the physical features of the land, including mountains, hills, valleys, and plains. Terrain is shaped by geological processes, such as weathering, erosion, and deposition. Terrain can vary greatly, from the highest mountains to the deepest oceans.\n\n## Geomorphology\nGeomorphology is the study of the Earth's surface features and the processes that shape them. Geomorphologists examine the relationship between the Earth's surface and the underlying geological structures, as well as the impact of human activities on the environment.\n\n## Climate\nClimate is a critical factor that shapes the Earth's surface and affects the distribution of land features. Climate influences the formation of mountains, the creation of rivers, and the development of soil. Climate also affects the distribution of plants and animals, which in turn shape the landscape.\n\n# Features\nLand features refer to the various natural and human-made characteristics of the Earth's surface. These features include coasts, islands, mountains, plateaus, plains, valleys, caves, and craters.\n\n## Coasts and Islands\nCoasts are the land areas that border the ocean, sea, or lake. Coasts can be rocky, sandy, or muddy, and are shaped by the interaction between the land and water. Islands are landmasses that are surrounded by water on all sides.\n\n## Mountains and Plateaus\nMountains are natural elevations of the Earth's surface, often formed by tectonic activity or volcanic eruptions. Plateaus are elevated areas of land that are relatively flat and are often formed by erosion or volcanic activity.\n\n## Plains and Valleys\nPlains are flat areas of land that are often formed by erosion or deposition. Valleys are low areas of land that are often formed by rivers or glaciers.\n\n## Caves and Craters\nCaves are natural openings in the Earth's surface, often formed by erosion or volcanic activity. Craters are depressions in the Earth's surface, often formed by volcanic eruptions or meteorite impacts.\n\n# Layers\nLand is composed of several layers, including land cover, soil, and continental crust.\n\n## Land Cover\nLand cover refers to the natural or human-made features that cover the Earth's surface. Land cover can include vegetation, water, urban areas, and other features.\n\n## Soil\nSoil is the upper layer of the Earth's surface, composed of mineral and organic matter. Soil is formed through the weathering of rocks and the addition of organic matter.\n\n## Continental Crust\nThe continental crust is the outer layer of the Earth's crust, composed of rocks and minerals. The continental crust is thicker and less dense than the oceanic crust.\n\n# Life Science\nLand is home to a diverse range of plants and animals, which are adapted to the various environments and ecosystems.\n\n## Land Biomes\nA biome is a large area of land that is characterized by a specific type of vegetation and animal life. There are several land biomes, including forests, grasslands, deserts, and tundras.\n\n## Fauna and Flora\nFauna refers to the animals that live on land, while flora refers to the plants. Land is home to a vast array of fauna and flora, including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and insects.\n\n# Humans and Land\nHumans have a complex and multifaceted relationship with land, which is shaped by culture, history, and economics.\n\n## Culture\nLand is often imbued with cultural significance, reflecting the values and traditions of a particular society. Land can be a source of identity, community, and spirituality.\n\n## Travel\nHumans have traveled across land for thousands of years, driven by exploration, trade, and migration. Travel has shaped the course of human history, facilitating the exchange of ideas, cultures, and technologies.\n\n## Trade\nLand is a critical factor in trade, providing resources, infrastructure, and markets. Trade has shaped the global economy, influencing the distribution of wealth and power.\n\n## Land Use\nLand use refers to the way in which humans utilize the land, including agriculture, urbanization, and conservation. Land use is a critical factor in shaping the environment and affecting the distribution of resources.\n\n## Law\nLand is governed by laws and regulations, which vary across different countries and jurisdictions. Land law is a complex and evolving field, reflecting the changing relationships between humans and the environment.\n\n## Geopolitics\nGeopolitics refers to the study of the relationship between geography, politics, and international relations. Geopolitics is shaped by the distribution of land, resources, and power, influencing the course of global events.\n\n# Environmental Issues\nLand is facing numerous environmental challenges, including soil degradation, pollution, biodiversity loss, and resource depletion.\n\n## Soil Degradation\nSoil degradation refers to the decline in soil quality, often caused by erosion, salinization, or nutrient depletion.

From its invention in 1876 by Alexander Graham Bell to the widespread use of cellphones and smartphones today, the telephone has revolutionized the way people communicate. This article will explore the major developments in the history of the telephone in the United States, including the rise of AT&T and the Bell System, the impact of cellphones and smartphones, and the social and cultural effects of telephone use.\n\n# AT&T and the Bell System\n\nAT&T, also known as the Bell System, played a dominant role in the development and expansion of the telephone industry in the United States. The company's history can be divided into several key periods, including the formation of the American Bell Telephone Company, the creation of AT&T, and the breakup of the company in 1982.\n\n## American Bell Telephone Company (1881–1899)\n\nThe American Bell Telephone Company was formed in 1881 by Alexander Graham Bell and his investors. The company's primary goal was to commercialize the telephone, which had been invented by Bell just a few years earlier. American Bell quickly expanded its operations, establishing telephone exchanges in cities across the United States. The company also developed a number of key technologies, including the switchboard, which allowed multiple telephones to be connected to a single exchange.\n\n## AT&T (1899–1982)\n\nIn 1899, American Bell was reorganized as AT&T, with Theodore Vail as its first president. Vail played a key role in shaping the company's strategy, focusing on expanding its operations and improving the quality of its service. During the early 20th century, AT&T continued to grow, acquiring a number of smaller telephone companies and expanding its operations into new areas.\n\n## Research priority\n\nAT&T placed a strong emphasis on research and development, establishing a number of research laboratories, including Bell Labs. These labs were responsible for developing many of the key technologies that drove the growth of the telephone industry, including the transistor, the laser, and the Unix operating system.\n\n## Targeting an audience\n\nAT&T also placed a strong emphasis on marketing and customer service, targeting specific audiences with tailored advertising and promotional campaigns.\n\n### Urban public telephones\n\nIn the early 20th century, AT&T began installing public telephones in urban areas, providing access to telephone service for people who did not have a phone at home. These public telephones quickly became a common sight in cities across the United States.\n\n### Rural telephone service\n\nAT&T also worked to expand telephone service to rural areas, where it was often difficult to install and maintain telephone lines. The company developed a number of innovative solutions, including the use of radio telephones and microwave transmission systems.\n\n## Breakup of AT&T in 1982\n\nIn 1982, AT&T was broken up into a number of smaller companies, including the Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs). This breakup was the result of a long-running antitrust lawsuit, which had been filed against AT&T in the 1970s. The breakup of AT&T marked a significant turning point in the history of the telephone industry in the United States, leading to increased competition and innovation in the years that followed.\n\n# Cellphones and smartphones\n\nThe development of cellphones and smartphones has had a profound impact on the telephone industry in the United States. The first cellphones were introduced in the 1980s, but it wasn't until the 1990s that they became widely popular. The introduction of smartphones, which combine the functionality of a phone with the features of a computer, has further transformed the industry.\n\n# Personnel\n\nThe telephone industry has a long history of employing a diverse range of personnel, from switchboard operators to engineers and technicians.\n\n## Switchboard and operators\n\nIn the early days of the telephone industry, switchboard operators played a crucial role in connecting calls. These operators were responsible for answering calls, directing them to the correct destination, and handling a wide range of customer inquiries.\n\n## Labor force: bias for and against women\n\nThe telephone industry has a complex history when it comes to the employment of women. On the one hand, the industry provided many women with their first opportunities for paid employment outside the home. On the other hand, women were often relegated to lower-paying jobs and faced significant barriers to advancement.\n\n### Strikes\n\nIn the early 20th century, telephone operators went on strike in a number of cities, demanding better pay and working conditions. These strikes were often marked by violent clashes between strikers and management.\n\n## Hawthorne studies\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, a series of studies were conducted at the Hawthorne Works, a Western Electric factory in Chicago. These studies, which were designed to investigate the impact of working conditions on productivity, had a profound impact on the development of modern management theory.\n\n## Employee benefits\n\nThe telephone industry has a long history of providing its employees with a range of benefits, including health insurance, pensions, and paid vacation time.\n\n# Users\n\nThe telephone has had a profound impact on the way people live and work in the United States. From businesses to households, the telephone has become an essential tool for communication and connection.\n\n## Business\n\nThe telephone has played a crucial role in the development of modern business, enabling companies to communicate with customers, suppliers, and partners across the country and around the world.\n\n## Housewives\n\nThe telephone has also had a significant impact on the lives of housewives, providing them with a means of connecting with friends and family, as well as accessing a range of services and information.\n\n## Gender and culture roles\n\nThe telephone has played a complex role in shaping gender and cultural roles in the United States. On the one hand, the telephone has provided women with greater independence and autonomy. On the other hand, it has also reinforced traditional gender roles and stereotypes.\n\n## Telemarketing\n\nThe telephone has also been used for telemarketing, which involves contacting potential customers by phone to sell them products or services.\n\n## 9-1-1\n\nThe telephone has played a crucial role in the development of emergency services, including the 9-1-1 system, which was introduced in the 1960s.\n\n## Harassing calls\n\nThe telephone has also been used for harassing calls, which can be a significant problem for individuals and households.\n\n## Literary fears\n\nThe telephone has also been the subject of a range of literary fears and anxieties, including the fear of being disconnected or unreachable.\n\n# See also\n\n* History of the telephone\n* AT&T\n* Bell System\n* Cellphone\n* Smartphone\n\n# References\n\n# Further reading\n\n## Social and cultural studies\n\n* Marvin, Carolyn.

He is a member of the Shiv Sena party and represents the Kopri-Pachpakhadi constituency in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly.\n\n#Early life\n\nEknath Shinde was born on 9 February 1964 in the Satara district of Maharashtra. His family later moved to Thane, where he spent most of his childhood. Shinde's father, Sambhaji Shinde, was a laborer, and his mother, Yashoda Shinde, was a homemaker. He has two siblings, a brother named Nitin Shinde and a sister named Kavita Shinde.\n\nShinde completed his early education at the Tilak Nagar Municipal High School in Thane. He later attended the Terna College in Nerul, Navi Mumbai, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree. After completing his education, Shinde worked as a laborer and later as a shop owner before entering politics.\n\n#Early political career\n\n##Entry into politics\n\nEknath Shinde's entry into politics was influenced by his family's association with the Shiv Sena party. His father, Sambhaji Shinde, was a member of the party, and Shinde would often accompany him to party meetings and events. In the 1980s, Shinde joined the party's youth wing, the Yuva Sena, and quickly rose through the ranks.\n\nShinde's early involvement in politics was focused on local issues in Thane, where he worked to resolve civic problems and provide assistance to residents. He gained recognition within the party for his organizational skills and his ability to connect with people at the grassroots level.\n\n##Maharashtra Legislative Assembly & ministries\n\nIn 2004, Shinde was elected to the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly from the Thane constituency. He was re-elected in 2009 and 2014, representing the Kopri-Pachpakhadi constituency. During his tenure as an MLA, Shinde held various portfolios, including Public Works, Urban Development, and Transport.\n\nAs a minister, Shinde was known for his work in improving the infrastructure of Thane and surrounding areas. He played a key role in the development of the Eastern Express Highway and the construction of several flyovers and bridges in the region.\n\n#Role in 2022 Maharashtra political crisis\n\nIn June 2022, Eknath Shinde played a crucial role in the Maharashtra political crisis that led to the downfall of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. Shinde, who was then the Urban Development Minister, rebelled against the Shiv Sena leadership, citing dissatisfaction with the party's alliance with the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Indian National Congress (INC).\n\nShinde's rebellion was backed by a group of MLAs from the Shiv Sena, who were dissatisfied with the party's leadership and the MVA government's policies. The group of rebels, led by Shinde, demanded that the Shiv Sena withdraw from the MVA alliance and form a government with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).\n\nThe crisis led to a split in the Shiv Sena, with Shinde's faction forming a new alliance with the BJP. The MVA government, led by Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, was eventually toppled, and Shinde was sworn in as the new Chief Minister of Maharashtra.\n\n#Chief Minister\n\nEknath Shinde was sworn in as the 20th Chief Minister of Maharashtra on 30 June 2022. His appointment was backed by the BJP, which had been a key player in the Maharashtra political crisis.\n\nAs Chief Minister, Shinde has focused on several key areas, including infrastructure development, economic growth, and social welfare. He has announced several initiatives aimed at improving the state's infrastructure, including the construction of new roads, bridges, and flyovers.\n\nShinde has also emphasized the need for greater transparency and accountability in governance. He has announced plans to implement a new system of governance that will allow citizens to track the progress of government projects and schemes.\n\n##Electoral performance\n\nEknath Shinde has contested several elections, including the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly elections and the Thane Municipal Corporation elections. His electoral performance has been impressive, with him winning several elections with a significant margin.\n\n| Election | Constituency | Party | Result |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2004 Maharashtra Legislative Assembly election | Thane | Shiv Sena | Won |\n| 2009 Maharashtra Legislative Assembly election | Kopri-Pachpakhadi | Shiv Sena | Won |\n| 2014 Maharashtra Legislative Assembly election | Kopri-Pachpakhadi | Shiv Sena | Won |\n| 2019 Maharashtra Legislative Assembly election | Kopri-Pachpakhadi | Shiv Sena | Won |\n\n#Leader of Shiv Sena\n\nEknath Shinde is currently the leader of the Shiv Sena party, although his leadership is disputed by the party's Uddhav Thackeray faction.\n\n##Shiv Sena leadership dispute\n\nThe Shiv Sena leadership dispute began in June 2022, when Shinde rebelled against the party's leadership. The dispute has led to a split in the party, with Shinde's faction forming a new alliance with the BJP.\n\nThe Uddhav Thackeray faction has challenged Shinde's leadership, claiming that he has no authority to lead the party. The faction has filed a petition in the Bombay High Court, seeking a stay on Shinde's leadership.\n\n##Political legitimacy\n\nShinde's political legitimacy has been questioned by several opposition parties, including the NCP and the INC. The parties have claimed that Shinde's appointment as Chief Minister is unconstitutional and that he has no mandate to lead the state.\n\nThe BJP has backed Shinde's leadership, claiming that he has the support of a majority of MLAs in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly.\n\n#Personal life\n\nEknath Shinde is married to Latabai Shinde, and the couple has three children: two sons, Shrikant Shinde and Purvesh Shinde, and a daughter, Hemali Shinde.\n\nShinde is a Hindu and follows the traditional customs and practices of his community. He is known to be a devout follower of Lord Ganesha and often visits temples and shrines during his spare time.\n\n#Popular culture\n\nEknath Shinde has been featured in several news articles and television programs, including a documentary series on the Maharashtra political crisis.\n\nShinde has also been the subject of several memes and jokes on social media, with many users poking fun at his role in the Maharashtra political crisis.\n\n#References\n\n#External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Eknath_Shinde\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n#Early political career\n##Entry into politics\n###Maharashtra Legislative Assembly & ministries\n##Role in 2022 Maharashtra political crisis\n#Chief Minister\n##Electoral performance\n#Leader of Shiv Sena\n##Shiv Sena leadership dispute\n##Political legitimacy\n#Personal life\n#Popular culture\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

With a career spanning over three decades, O'Connor has released numerous critically acclaimed albums and has been recognized for her innovative and provocative style.\n\nEarly Life and Education\n------------------------\n\nSinéad O'Connor was born on December 8, 1970, in Dublin, Ireland, to Sean O'Connor, a structural engineer, and Marie O'Connor, a dressmaker. She was the third of four children, and her parents divorced when she was eight years old. O'Connor's mother, who struggled with addiction and mental health issues, was largely absent from her life, and she was raised by her father and his relatives.\n\nO'Connor attended several schools in Dublin, including the National College of Art and Design, where she studied painting and music. However, she dropped out of school at 15 to pursue a career in music.\n\nMusic Career\n-------------\n\n### 1980s\n\nO'Connor began performing on the streets of Dublin and in local clubs, eventually forming a band called Ton Ton Macoute. In 1984, she was discovered by Nigel Grainge, the head of Chrysalis Records, who signed her to a recording contract.\n\n### 1987–1989: The Lion and the Cobra\n\nO'Connor's debut album, The Lion and the Cobra, was released in 1987 to critical acclaim. The album's mix of folk, rock, and pop styles, combined with O'Connor's powerful vocals and introspective lyrics, established her as a rising star in the music industry.\n\n### 1990–1993: I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got\n\nO'Connor's second album, I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got, was released in 1990 and became a huge commercial success, selling over 7 million copies worldwide. The album's lead single, \"Nothing Compares 2 U,\" a cover of a song written by Prince, became a massive hit and helped establish O'Connor as a global superstar.\n\n#### Saturday Night Live Protest\n\nIn 1992, O'Connor appeared on Saturday Night Live, where she performed an a cappella version of Bob Marley's \"War.\" During the performance, she held up a photograph of Pope John Paul II and tore it into pieces, sparking widespread controversy and outrage. O'Connor's actions were seen as a protest against the Catholic Church's handling of child abuse allegations and its stance on women's rights.\n\n### 1993–2000\n\nO'Connor's subsequent albums, including Universal Mother (1994) and Gospel Oak (1997), explored themes of motherhood, spirituality, and social justice. However, she faced declining commercial success and increasing criticism for her outspoken views and unconventional style.\n\n### 2000s\n\nIn the 2000s, O'Connor released several albums, including Faith and Courage (2000) and Throw Down Your Arms (2005), which featured reggae-infused rhythms and socially conscious lyrics. She also became increasingly involved in activism, particularly in the area of women's rights and LGBTQ+ issues.\n\n### 2010s\n\nO'Connor's 2010 album, How About I Be Me (and You Be You)?, marked a return to her rock roots and featured a more introspective and personal lyrical approach. She also released several singles and EPs, including the critically acclaimed \"The Vishnu Room\" (2015).\n\n### 2020–2023: Memoir and Death of Son\n\nIn 2021, O'Connor published her memoir, Rememberings, which detailed her life struggles, including her experiences with addiction, mental health issues, and her complicated relationships with her parents. Tragically, in 2023, O'Connor's 17-year-old son, Shane, died by suicide, prompting an outpouring of tributes and support from fans and fellow musicians.\n\nPersonal Life\n-------------\n\n### Marriages and Children\n\nO'Connor has been married four times and has four children. Her first marriage, to musician John Reynolds, ended in divorce in 1995. She later married journalist Nick Sommerlad, with whom she had a son, Jake, before divorcing in 2002. O'Connor's third marriage, to musician Steve Cooney, ended in divorce in 2011. She married Irish therapist Barry Herridge in 2011, but the marriage was annulled after just 16 days.\n\n### Other Relationships\n\nO'Connor has been in several high-profile relationships, including with musician Peter Gabriel and actor Liam Neeson.\n\n### Homes\n\nO'Connor has lived in various locations, including Dublin, London, and Los Angeles. She currently resides in Ireland.\n\n### Sexuality\n\nO'Connor has identified as a lesbian and has been an outspoken advocate for LGBTQ+ rights.\n\n### Politics\n\nO'Connor has been a vocal critic of social injustice and has supported various causes, including women's rights, LGBTQ+ rights, and anti-war movements.\n\n### Religion\n\nO'Connor was raised Catholic but has been critical of the Church's stance on women's rights and child abuse allegations. She has explored various spiritual traditions, including Buddhism and Rastafarianism.\n\n### Health\n\nO'Connor has struggled with addiction and mental health issues throughout her life, including depression and bipolar disorder.\n\n### Death\n\nO'Connor is still active and alive.\n\nTributes\n---------\n\nO'Connor has been recognized for her contributions to music and social justice, including several Grammy nominations and a MTV Europe Music Award for Best Female Artist.\n\nIn Popular Culture\n-------------------\n\nO'Connor's music and style have influenced numerous artists, including Alanis Morissette, Lauryn Hill, and Regina Spektor.

Born on March 6, 1992, in Stanford, California, Bankman-Fried rose to prominence in the cryptocurrency industry before facing a series of controversies and ultimately being charged with multiple crimes related to the bankruptcy of FTX.\n\nEarly life and education\n------------------------\n\nBankman-Fried grew up in a family of academics and was raised on the Stanford University campus. His parents, Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, are both professors at Stanford Law School. Bankman-Fried's parents were described as \"highly educated\" and \"strongly liberal.\" He has one brother, Gabe Bankman-Fried, who is also involved in politics.\n\nBankman-Fried attended the Crystal Springs Uplands School in Hillsborough, California, before enrolling at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 2010. At MIT, he studied physics and was a member of the MIT debate team. Bankman-Fried graduated from MIT in 2014 with a degree in physics.\n\nCareer\n--------\n\nAfter graduating from MIT, Bankman-Fried began his career as a trader at Jane Street, a quantitative trading firm. He worked at Jane Street for three years before leaving to start his own trading firm, Alameda Research, in 2017. Alameda Research was a quantitative trading firm that focused on trading cryptocurrencies and other digital assets.\n\nIn 2019, Bankman-Fried co-founded FTX, a cryptocurrency derivatives exchange. FTX quickly gained popularity and became one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world. Bankman-Fried served as the CEO of FTX until the company's bankruptcy in 2022.\n\nViews on charity and market regulation\n--------------------------------------\n\nBankman-Fried has been a vocal advocate for the effective altruism movement, which aims to use reason and evidence to improve the lives of others. He has stated that he intends to give away the majority of his wealth during his lifetime, and has already donated millions of dollars to various charitable causes.\n\nBankman-Fried has also been a vocal advocate for greater regulation of the cryptocurrency market. He has stated that he believes the market is currently under-regulated, and that greater regulation is necessary to prevent market manipulation and protect investors.\n\nBankruptcy of FTX\n-----------------\n\nIn November 2022, FTX filed for bankruptcy and Bankman-Fried resigned as CEO. The bankruptcy was the result of a liquidity crisis, which was triggered by a series of events including the collapse of the cryptocurrency market and a run on the company's assets.\n\nThe bankruptcy of FTX was widely seen as one of the most significant events in the history of the cryptocurrency market. It led to a collapse in the value of cryptocurrencies and raised concerns about the stability of the market.\n\nArrest and charges\n-----------------\n\nIn December 2022, Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas and charged with multiple crimes related to the bankruptcy of FTX. The charges include wire fraud, securities fraud, and money laundering.\n\nBankman-Fried was extradited to the United States and is currently being held in pre-trial detention. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges and is awaiting trial.\n\nUnited States v. Bankman-Fried\n-----------------------------\n\nThe case against Bankman-Fried is being heard in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The case is being prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, and is being defended by a team of lawyers led by Mark Cohen.\n\nTrial conclusion\n----------------\n\nThe trial of Bankman-Fried is ongoing, but it is expected to conclude in the coming months. If convicted, Bankman-Fried faces a maximum sentence of 115 years in prison.\n\nSecond trial dismissed\n----------------------\n\nIn addition to the federal charges, Bankman-Fried was also facing a separate trial in New York state court on charges of tax evasion and other crimes. However, in January 2023, the state court judge dismissed the case, citing a lack of evidence.\n\nAppeal\n--------\n\nBankman-Fried's lawyers have stated that they intend to appeal the decision to dismiss the state court case. However, it is unclear whether an appeal will be successful.\n\nIncarceration history\n----------------------\n\nBankman-Fried is currently being held in pre-trial detention at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York. He has been held in solitary confinement due to concerns about his safety and the potential for him to flee the country.\n\nDonations\n---------\n\nBankman-Fried has been a prolific donor to charitable causes, and has given away millions of dollars to various organizations. However, some of his donations have been the subject of controversy.\n\nPolitics\n---------\n\nBankman-Fried has been a vocal supporter of the Democratic Party, and has donated millions of dollars to Democratic candidates and causes.\n\n2020 and earlier\n----------------\n\nIn the 2020 presidential election, Bankman-Fried donated $5.2 million to the campaign of Joe Biden. He also donated millions of dollars to other Democratic candidates and causes.\n\n2021–2022\n------------\n\nIn 2021, Bankman-Fried donated $2 million to the campaign of Eric Adams, who was running for mayor of New York City. He also donated millions of dollars to other Democratic candidates and causes.\n\n2022 U.S. midterm elections\n---------------------------\n\nIn the 2022 U.S. midterm elections, Bankman-Fried donated millions of dollars to Democratic candidates and causes. However, some of his donations were the subject of controversy, with some critics accusing him of trying to buy influence in Washington.\n\nPandemic prevention contributions and related controversy\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn 2020, Bankman-Fried donated $1.7 million to the Center for Global Development, a think tank that focuses on global health and development issues. However, some critics accused him of trying to use his donations to influence the think tank's research and policy recommendations.\n\nAttempts to recoup donations\n-----------------------------\n\nIn the wake of the FTX bankruptcy, some of the recipients of Bankman-Fried's donations have faced pressure to return the money. However, it is unclear whether any of the recipients will ultimately return the donations.\n\nPersonal life\n-------------\n\nBankman-Fried is unmarried and does not have any children. He has stated that he is a vegan and has a strong interest in animal welfare.\n\nNotes\n------\n\nThis article is a factual summary of the life and career of Sam Bankman-Fried.

The species is a member of the genus Torreya, which is part of the family Taxaceae. Torreya taxifolia has been a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists due to its unique characteristics and the threats it faces in the wild.\n\n# Species discovery\n\nTorreya taxifolia was first discovered by botanists in the early 19th century. The species was initially described by American botanist John Torrey in 1838. However, it was not until the 20th century that the species gained significant attention from the scientific community.\n\n# Taxonomy and naming\n\nThe genus Torreya is named after John Torrey, an American botanist who first described the species. The species name taxifolia is derived from the Latin words \"taxus,\" meaning yew, and \"folia,\" meaning leaves, due to the similarity in leaf shape between Torreya and Taxus species.\n\n# Type species of genus Torreya\n\nTorreya taxifolia is the type species of the genus Torreya. The genus is composed of six species, including Torreya taxifolia, which is the most well-known and widespread species in the genus.\n\n# Common names\n\nTorreya taxifolia is commonly known as the Florida nutmeg or stinking cedar. The name \"Florida nutmeg\" refers to the fact that the seeds of the tree resemble nutmeg seeds, while \"stinking cedar\" refers to the strong, unpleasant odor of the tree's wood and foliage.\n\n# Description\n\n## Technical description\n\nTorreya taxifolia is a coniferous evergreen tree that can grow up to 15 meters in height. The tree has a straight trunk with a diameter of up to 1 meter, and its bark is grayish-brown in color. The leaves of the tree are dark green, lance-shaped, and 2-4 centimeters in length. The seeds of the tree are brown, egg-shaped, and 2-3 centimeters in length.\n\n## Subcanopy growth adaptations\n\nTorreya taxifolia has adapted to grow in the subcanopy layer of forests, where light levels are limited. The tree has a slender profile and a small crown, which allows it to compete with other vegetation for limited light resources. The tree's leaves are also adapted to optimize light absorption, with a waxy coating that helps to reflect light and reduce water loss.\n\n# Distribution\n\n## Wild population\n\nTorreya taxifolia is native to the southeastern United States, specifically in the states of Florida and Georgia. The species is found in the wild in a limited range of habitats, including ravines, bluffs, and floodplains.\n\n## Prehistoric distribution\n\nFossil evidence suggests that Torreya taxifolia had a wider distribution in the past, with fossils found in sedimentary deposits dating back to the Pleistocene era. The species is thought to have been more widely distributed during the last ice age, when the climate was cooler and wetter.\n\n# Ecology\n\n## Habitat\n\nTorreya taxifolia is typically found in humid, temperate forests with mild winters and hot, humid summers. The species prefers well-drained soils and partial shade, although it can tolerate full sun in some cases.\n\n## Seed dispersal\n\nThe seeds of Torreya taxifolia are dispersed by animals, including birds and small mammals. The seeds are an important food source for these animals, which helps to spread the species to new areas.\n\n# Extinction threats\n\n## Vulnerabilities of restricted range size\n\nTorreya taxifolia is threatened by its limited range size, which makes it vulnerable to extinction. The species is found in a limited number of habitats, which makes it susceptible to environmental changes and human activities.\n\n## The die-off begins\n\nIn the 1950s, a die-off of Torreya taxifolia trees was observed in the wild. The die-off was characterized by a rapid decline in tree growth and mortality, which was attributed to a combination of factors, including disease, pests, and environmental stress.\n\n## The role of pathogens in the die-off\n\nPathogens, including fungi and bacteria, have been implicated in the die-off of Torreya taxifolia trees. These pathogens can infect the tree's roots, stems, and leaves, causing damage and death.\n\n## The role of habitat deterioration in the die-off\n\nHabitat deterioration has also been implicated in the die-off of Torreya taxifolia trees. The species is adapted to grow in humid, temperate forests, and changes to these habitats, such as soil degradation and altered hydrology, can stress the trees and make them more susceptible to disease and pests.\n\n## Focus on a stem canker fungus\n\nA stem canker fungus, Phomopsis juniperovora, has been identified as a major contributor to the die-off of Torreya taxifolia trees. This fungus infects the tree's stems, causing cankers and death.\n\n## Ultimate cause of die-off still unsolved\n\nDespite research, the ultimate cause of the die-off of Torreya taxifolia trees remains unsolved. It is likely that a combination of factors, including disease, pests, environmental stress, and habitat deterioration, contributed to the die-off.\n\n# Conservation actions\n\n## Protect areas in species range\n\nConservation efforts have focused on protecting areas within the species' range, including the establishment of nature reserves and national parks.\n\n## List the species as endangered\n\nTorreya taxifolia is listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List, which highlights the need for conservation action to protect the species.\n\n## In situ habitat improvement\n\nIn situ habitat improvement involves restoring and improving the quality of habitats within the species' range. This can include measures such as soil conservation, hydrological management, and invasive species control.\n\n## Ex situ genetic safeguarding\n\nEx situ genetic safeguarding involves collecting and storing genetic material from the species, such as seeds and tissue samples, to safeguard against extinction.\n\n## Document early horticultural plantings\n\nEarly horticultural plantings of Torreya taxifolia have been documented, which provides valuable information on the species' history and distribution.\n\n# Conservation controversies\n\n## Assisted migration (the policy debate)\n\nAssisted migration, which involves moving plants or animals to new areas to help them adapt to changing environmental conditions, is a topic of debate in the conservation community. Some argue that assisted migration can help to conserve species, while others argue that it can disrupt ecosystems and lead to unintended consequences.\n\n## Management of seeds produced ex situ\n\nThe management of seeds produced ex situ is a complex issue, with some arguing that these seeds should be used for conservation purposes, while others argue that they should be used for horticultural purposes.\n\n### Seeds produced from official plantings\n\nSeeds produced from official plantings, such as those in botanical gardens, are typically managed by conservation organizations.\n\n### Seeds accessed by citizens\n\nSeeds accessed by citizens, such as those collected from wild populations, can be managed by individuals or community groups, although this can raise concerns about the potential for misuse or over-collection.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Torreya_taxifolia\" following this outline:\n\n#Species discovery\n#Taxonomy and naming\n#Type species of genus Torreya\n#Common names\n#Description\n##Technical description\n##Subcanopy growth adaptations\n#Distribution\n##Wild population\n##Prehistoric distribution\n#Ecology\n##Habitat\n##Seed dispersal\n#Extinction threats\n##Vulnerabilities of restricted range size\n##The die-off begins\n##The role of pathogens in the die-off\n##The role of habitat deterioration in the die-off\n##Focus on a stem canker fungus\n##Ultimate cause of die-off still unsolved\n#Conservation actions\n##Protect areas in species range\n##List the species as endangered\n##In situ habitat improvement\n##Ex situ genetic safeguarding\n##Document early horticultural plantings\n#Conservation controversies\n##Assisted migration (the policy debate)\n##Management of seeds produced ex situ\n###Seeds produced from official plantings\n###Seeds accessed by citizens\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This plant has been a subject of interest for centuries, not only for its unique characteristics but also for its various uses, from medicinal applications to its role as a nitrogen-fixing pioneer and companion plant.\n\n#Scientific Name\nThe scientific name Anagyris foetida is derived from the Greek words \"anagyris,\" meaning \"unlovely\" or \"unpleasant,\" and \"foetida,\" meaning \"smelling badly.\" This refers to the plant's strong, unpleasant odor.\n\n#Common names\nAnagyris foetida is commonly known as the stinking bean trefoil, Mediterranean stink bean, or simply stink bean. It is also referred to as the bean trefoil or the foetid trefoil.\n\n#Distribution\nAnagyris foetida is native to the Mediterranean region, where it is widely distributed in countries such as Spain, France, Italy, Greece, and Portugal. It has also been naturalized in other parts of the world, including Australia, South Africa, and the southwestern United States.\n\n#Habitat\nAnagyris foetida typically grows in dry, sandy soils and rocky outcrops, often in scrublands, woodlands, and along roadsides. It is a drought-tolerant plant that can thrive in poor soil conditions.\n\n#Adaptations to growth in Winter and early Spring\nAnagyris foetida has several adaptations that enable it to grow during the winter and early spring months when other plants are dormant.\n\n##Summer leaf-fall\nOne of the most notable adaptations of Anagyris foetida is its ability to drop its leaves during the summer months, a process known as summer leaf-fall. This allows the plant to conserve water and energy during the hottest part of the year.\n\n##Pollination by birds\nAnagyris foetida is one of the few plants that is pollinated by birds. The plant's flowers are rich in nectar, which attracts birds such as sunbirds and bee-eaters. As the birds feed on the nectar, they transfer pollen from one plant to another, facilitating pollination.\n\n#Seed dispersal\nAnagyris foetida has a unique seed dispersal mechanism that involves several different vectors.\n\n##Soil seed banks\nThe seeds of Anagyris foetida can remain dormant in the soil for many years, forming a soil seed bank. This allows the plant to colonize new areas and recover from disturbances.\n\n##Olive mimicry\nThe seeds of Anagyris foetida are often mistaken for olive seeds, which leads to their dispersal by animals that feed on olives. This is an example of a process known as \"deceptive seed dispersal,\" where one plant species benefits from the dispersal activities of another species.\n\n##Role of sheep\nSheep play a significant role in the dispersal of Anagyris foetida seeds. The seeds are often ingested by sheep, which then deposit them in new areas, often in the form of nutrient-rich dung.\n\n##Other possible mammalian and avian vectors\nIn addition to sheep, other mammals and birds may also play a role in the dispersal of Anagyris foetida seeds. These include goats, deer, and birds such as starlings and mynah birds.\n\n##Unknown seed dispersal vector\nDespite the various seed dispersal mechanisms that have been identified, there is still an unknown vector that plays a significant role in the dispersal of Anagyris foetida seeds. Further research is needed to identify this vector.\n\n##Tough, waterproof seed coats\nThe seeds of Anagyris foetida have tough, waterproof coats that protect them from damage during dispersal. This allows the seeds to survive for long periods of time in a variety of environments.\n\n#Value as a nitrogen-fixing pioneer and companion plant\nAnagyris foetida is a valuable nitrogen-fixing pioneer and companion plant. Its ability to fix nitrogen from the air makes it an important component of many ecosystems, particularly in areas with poor soil fertility.\n\n#Medicinal use\nAnagyris foetida has been used in traditional medicine for centuries, particularly in the Mediterranean region. The plant contains a number of bioactive compounds, including alkaloids and glycosides, which have been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties.\n\n#Toxicity\nDespite its medicinal uses, Anagyris foetida is also toxic, particularly to animals.\n\n##Alkaloid anagyrine a cause of birth defects\nThe alkaloid anagyrine, which is found in Anagyris foetida, has been shown to cause birth defects in animals. This highlights the need for caution when handling the plant, particularly for pregnant women.\n\n##Danger to children\nAnagyris foetida is also a danger to children, who may be tempted to eat the plant's seeds or leaves. The plant's toxic compounds can cause vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain in children.\n\n##Hazardous tainting of milk products\nAnagyris foetida can also contaminate milk products, particularly if animals that have ingested the plant are used for dairy production. This can lead to the tainting of milk and other dairy products with toxic compounds.\n\n##Case of accidental poisoning in Algeria\nIn 2015, a case of accidental poisoning was reported in Algeria, where a group of people ingested Anagyris foetida seeds, believing them to be edible.

The previous election, held in November 2019, had resulted in a hung parliament and the formation of a coalition government between the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) and Unidas Podemos.\n\n## Electoral system\n\nSpain uses a closed-list proportional representation electoral system to elect the members of the Congress of Deputies. The country is divided into 50 multi-member constituencies, with each constituency electing a minimum of two deputies, and the remaining 248 seats being allocated among the constituencies in proportion to their population. The Senate uses a mixed electoral system, with 208 seats being elected by the population and 58 seats being appointed by the regional legislatures.\n\n## Election date\n\nThe election date was set by King Felipe VI, following the dissolution of the Cortes Generales on 29 May 2023. The election was initially scheduled to take place on 25 June 2023, but was later postponed to 23 July 2023, due to the coincidence with the summer solstice and the start of the summer holidays.\n\n# Parliamentary composition\n\nAt the time of the election, the Cortes Generales were composed as follows:\n\n| Party | Congress of Deputies | Senate |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| PSOE | 120 | 93 |\n| PP | 89 | 83 |\n| Vox | 52 | 24 |\n| Unidas Podemos | 35 | 19 |\n| ERC | 13 | 13 |\n| Junts | 8 | 5 |\n| PNV | 6 | 10 |\n| EH Bildu | 5 | 2 |\n| Others | 22 | 17 |\n\n# Parties and candidates\n\nA total of 24 parties and coalitions presented candidates in the election.

Founded in 2009 by Stockton Rush and Guillermo Söhnlein, the company has gained international recognition for its innovative submersible designs and its role in exploring some of the world's most famous shipwrecks, including the Titanic.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nOceanGate's mission is to expand humanity's understanding of the ocean and its ecosystems by providing safe and reliable access to the underwater world. The company's founders, both experienced entrepreneurs and explorers, recognized the need for a new generation of submersibles that could overcome the limitations of traditional underwater vehicles. By combining advanced materials, design, and technology, OceanGate's submersibles aim to make underwater exploration more accessible, efficient, and sustainable.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### 2009–2013: Founding and acquisition of Antipodes\n\nOceanGate was founded in 2009 by Stockton Rush and Guillermo Söhnlein, two entrepreneurs with a shared passion for underwater exploration. Initially, the company focused on designing and building a new type of submersible that could dive deeper and stay longer underwater than existing vehicles. In 2010, OceanGate acquired Antipodes, a small submersible company founded by Söhnlein in 2007. Antipodes had developed a reputation for building high-quality, custom submersibles for research and exploration.\n\n### 2013–2016: Construction of Cyclops and Söhnlein's departure\n\nIn 2013, OceanGate began construction of Cyclops 1, a new submersible designed to dive to depths of up to 500 feet (152 meters). The Cyclops 1 was a significant departure from traditional submersible designs, featuring a large, spherical hull and advanced life support systems. During this period, Söhnlein left OceanGate to pursue other ventures, leaving Rush as the company's sole CEO.\n\n### 2016–2023: Expansion of fleet and dives to the Titanic\n\nIn 2016, OceanGate launched Titan, a new submersible designed to dive to the wreck of the Titanic, which lies at a depth of approximately 12,500 feet (3,800 meters). Titan was the first submersible to be certified to dive to this depth, and its maiden voyage to the Titanic wreck site marked a major milestone for the company. Over the next several years, OceanGate expanded its fleet to include multiple submersibles, including Antipodes and Cyclops 1, and conducted numerous dives to the Titanic and other shipwreck sites.\n\n### 2023: Implosion of Titan and death of Rush\n\nOn June 18, 2023, the submersible Titan imploded while on a dive to the Titanic wreck site, resulting in the death of Stockton Rush and four other people on board. The incident was widely reported and sparked an investigation into the cause of the implosion.\n\nSubmersibles\n------------\n\n### Antipodes\n\nAntipodes is a small, 3-person submersible designed for shallow-water operations. Originally built by Söhnlein's company, Antipodes was acquired by OceanGate in 2010 and has since been used for a variety of research and exploration projects.\n\n### Cyclops 1\n\nCyclops 1 is a 5-person submersible designed for mid-depth operations. Featuring a large, spherical hull and advanced life support systems, Cyclops 1 is capable of diving to depths of up to 500 feet (152 meters).\n\n### Titan\n\nTitan is a 5-person submersible designed for deep-sea operations. Certified to dive to depths of up to 12,500 feet (3,800 meters), Titan was the first submersible to visit the wreck of the Titanic since the 1980s. Titan's design features a large, titanium hull and advanced life support systems.\n\nAssociated entities\n-------------------\n\nOceanGate has collaborated with a number of organizations and individuals on its underwater exploration and research projects.

The film is a semi-autobiographical account of Spielberg's own childhood and early career as a filmmaker. It premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2022 and received widespread critical acclaim for its nostalgic and emotional portrayal of a young boy's journey to become a filmmaker.\n\nPlot\n-----\n\nThe Fabelmans is set in the 1950s and 1960s in Arizona and California. The film follows the life of Sammy Fabelman, a young Jewish boy who discovers his passion for filmmaking after his parents take him to see a movie. Sammy's father, Burt, is an engineer who works for the government, while his mother, Mitzi, is a pianist who encourages Sammy's creative pursuits. As Sammy grows older, he begins to make his own short films using his father's camera, often using his family and friends as actors.\n\nHowever, Sammy's idyllic childhood is disrupted when his family moves to California and his parents' marriage begins to fall apart. Sammy's father is increasingly absent, and his mother begins an affair with one of her husband's colleagues. Sammy's own relationships with his family members become strained, and he finds solace in his filmmaking.\n\nAs Sammy enters his teenage years, he faces anti-Semitism and bullying at school, but he also discovers his talent for filmmaking and begins to make more sophisticated short films. He eventually gets accepted into a film program at a local college, where he meets a group of like-minded young filmmakers who encourage him to pursue his dreams.\n\nCast\n-----\n\n* Gabriel LaBelle as Sammy Fabelman\n* Michelle Williams as Mitzi Fabelman\n* Paul Dano as Burt Fabelman\n* Seth Rogen as Bennie Loewy\n* Julia Butters as Reggie Fabelman\n* Keeley Karsten as Natalie Fabelman\n* Jeannie Berlin as Haddie Fabelman\n* Judd Hirsch as Uncle Boris\n* Robin Bartlett as Tina Schildkraut\n* Sam Rechner as Logan Hall\n* Chandler Lovelle as Renee\n* Gustavo Escobar as Sal\n* Nicolas Cantu as Hark\n\nProduction\n------------\n\n### Development\n\nThe Fabelmans was developed by Steven Spielberg and Tony Kushner over several years. Spielberg had long wanted to make a film about his own childhood, but he was hesitant to do so until he felt that he had gained enough distance from the events. Kushner, who had previously collaborated with Spielberg on Lincoln and West Side Story, encouraged Spielberg to tell his own story.\n\nThe two writers began working on the script in 2019, drawing on Spielberg's own memories of his childhood and early career as a filmmaker. They also conducted extensive research, including interviews with Spielberg's family members and friends.\n\n### Writing\n\nThe screenplay for The Fabelmans was written by Spielberg and Kushner in collaboration. The two writers worked closely together, with Spielberg providing the initial story and Kushner helping to shape the script.\n\nThe screenplay is semi-autobiographical, drawing on Spielberg's own experiences as a young filmmaker. However, it is not a straightforward retelling of his life story. Rather, it is a fictionalized account that incorporates elements of his own experiences and emotions.\n\n### Pre-production\n\nPre-production on The Fabelmans began in 2020, with Spielberg and his team scouting locations in Arizona and California. The film was shot on location in both states, with additional scenes filmed at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank.\n\nThe film's production team included many longtime collaborators of Spielberg's, including cinematographer Janusz Kaminski and production designer Adam Stockhausen.\n\n### Casting\n\nCasting for The Fabelmans began in 2020, with Gabriel LaBelle being cast as Sammy Fabelman. Michelle Williams and Paul Dano were cast as Sammy's parents, Mitzi and Burt.\n\nThe film's supporting cast includes Seth Rogen, Julia Butters, and Jeannie Berlin. Judd Hirsch, who appeared in Spielberg's 1975 film Jaws, has a cameo role as Uncle Boris.\n\n### Filming\n\nFilming on The Fabelmans took place over several months in 2021. The film was shot on location in Arizona and California, with additional scenes filmed at Warner Bros. Studios.\n\nSpielberg worked closely with his cast and crew to create a nostalgic and emotional portrayal of a young boy's journey to become a filmmaker. He used a combination of practical and visual effects to bring the film's story to life.\n\n### Production design\n\nThe film's production design was overseen by Adam Stockhausen, who worked closely with Spielberg to create a nostalgic and authentic portrayal of the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nThe film's sets and costumes were designed to evoke the period, with attention to detail paid to everything from the furniture to the clothing.\n\n### Visual effects\n\nThe film's visual effects were overseen by Michael Kahn, who worked closely with Spielberg to create a seamless blend of practical and visual effects.\n\nThe film's visual effects were used to enhance the story, rather than to overpower it. They were used to create the film's nostalgic and dreamlike atmosphere, as well as to bring the film's characters and settings to life.\n\nMusic\n------\n\nThe film's score was composed by John Williams, who has worked with Spielberg on many of his previous films. The score is a nostalgic and emotional portrayal of a young boy's journey to become a filmmaker.\n\nThe film's soundtrack also features several period-specific songs, including \"Rock Around the Clock\" and \"Earth Angel\".\n\nThemes and interpretations\n-------------------------\n\nThe Fabelmans is a coming-of-age drama that explores the themes of family, identity, and creativity. The film is a nostalgic and emotional portrayal of a young boy's journey to become a filmmaker, and it is also a semi-autobiographical account of Spielberg's own childhood and early career.\n\nThe film has been interpreted in many different ways, with some critics seeing it as a nostalgic and sentimental portrayal of a bygone era.
