The election was the fifth national election in four years, following the previous elections in 2019, 2020, and 2021, which failed to produce a stable government.\n\n# Background\n\nThe 2021 election resulted in the formation of a fragile coalition government led by Naftali Bennett and Yair Lapid, with Bennett serving as prime minister and Lapid as alternate prime minister. However, the coalition faced significant challenges, including internal divisions and opposition from the right-wing and ultra-Orthodox parties. In June 2022, the government collapsed, triggering a new election.\n\nThe election campaign was marked by a focus on the economy, security, and the role of religion in public life. Many parties campaigned on promises to address the rising cost of living, improve healthcare and education, and strengthen Israel's defense capabilities. The election also saw a rise in populist and nationalist rhetoric, particularly from right-wing parties.\n\n# Campaign\n\nThe campaign was marked by a number of controversies, including allegations of corruption and personal attacks between candidates. The Likud party, led by Benjamin Netanyahu, focused on attacking the current government and promising to restore stability and security. The Yesh Atid party, led by Yair Lapid, campaigned on a platform of economic reform and social justice.\n\nThe Joint List, a coalition of Arab parties, focused on issues affecting the Arab community, including poverty, housing, and discrimination. The Religious Zionist party, led by Bezalel Smotrich, campaigned on a platform of strengthening Jewish identity and opposing the current government's policies on issues such as LGBTQ+ rights.\n\n# Timeline\n\n* June 29, 2022: The Knesset votes to dissolve itself, triggering a new election.\n* July 14, 2022: The Central Elections Committee announces the election date as November 1, 2022.\n* August 10, 2022: The deadline for parties to submit their lists of candidates.\n* October 20, 2022: The start of the official election campaign.\n* November 1, 2022: Election day.\n\n# Electoral System\n\nIsrael uses a proportional representation system, in which voters cast ballots for a party rather than a specific candidate. The parties are allocated seats in the Knesset based on the number of votes they receive.\n\n## Surplus-vote Agreements\n\nSome parties entered into surplus-vote agreements, in which they agreed to pool their surplus votes in order to maximize their chances of winning seats. These agreements are permitted under Israeli law, but have been criticized for creating alliances between parties that might not otherwise cooperate.\n\n# Political Parties\n\n## Factions before the Election\n\nThe following parties were represented in the 24th Knesset:\n\n* Likud\n* Yesh Atid\n* Blue and White\n* Shas\n* United Torah Judaism\n* Labor\n* Meretz\n* Yamina\n* New Hope\n* Ra'am\n* Hadash-Ta'al\n* Balad\n\n## Retiring Incumbents\n\nSeveral long-serving members of the Knesset announced their retirement before the election, including:\n\n* Avi Nissenkorn (Blue and White)\n* Ofer Shelah (Yesh Atid)\n* Chili Tropper (Blue and White)\n* Orly Levy-Abekasis (Gesher)\n\n## Contesting Parties\n\nA total of 40 parties submitted lists of candidates for the election.

The incident involved Labour Party leader Keir Starmer and his deputy Angela Rayner attending a gathering at a constituency office in Durham, England. The event was subject to investigation by the Durham Constabulary, sparking widespread media coverage and public debate.\n\n# Durham event\n\nOn April 30, 2021, Keir Starmer and Angela Rayner attended a gathering at the office of Labour MP Mary Foy in Durham. The event was described as a campaign meeting to discuss the upcoming local elections. However, reports emerged that food and drink, including beer, were consumed during the gathering.\n\n## Video footage\n\nFootage obtained by the media showed Starmer and Rayner sitting at a table with other attendees, with bottles of beer and plates of food visible. The video sparked questions about whether the gathering constituted a breach of COVID-19 regulations in place at the time.\n\n# Response to Partygate\n\nThe Beergate controversy unfolded against the backdrop of the Partygate scandal, which involved allegations of rule-breaking by Prime Minister Boris Johnson and other Conservative Party officials. Labour Party leaders, including Starmer, had been critical of the government's handling of the pandemic and the Partygate scandal.\n\nStarmer and other Labour Party officials maintained that the Durham event was a legitimate campaign meeting, and that they had followed all relevant COVID-19 guidelines. However, critics accused them of hypocrisy, arguing that the event was indistinguishable from the gatherings that had sparked the Partygate scandal.\n\n# Initial police review\n\nIn May 2022, the Durham Constabulary announced that they would review the circumstances surrounding the Durham event. The police stated that they would assess whether any COVID-19 regulations had been breached, and determine whether further investigation was warranted.\n\n## Calls for further investigation\n\nConservative Party officials and some media commentators called for a full police investigation into the Durham event. They argued that the gathering appeared to be in breach of COVID-19 regulations, and that Starmer and Rayner had failed to provide adequate explanations for their actions.\n\n# Police investigation\n\nIn May 2022, the Durham Constabulary launched a formal investigation into the Durham event.\n\n## Start of investigation\n\nThe police investigation was led by a senior officer, who was tasked with gathering evidence and interviewing witnesses. The police stated that they would investigate whether any COVID-19 regulations had been breached, and whether Starmer and Rayner had committed any offenses.\n\n## New allegations\n\nDuring the course of the investigation, new allegations emerged about the Durham event. Some attendees reported that they had been asked to delete social media posts and emails related to the gathering, sparking concerns about a potential cover-up.\n\n## Starmer's and Rayner's resignation pledges\n\nIn response to the investigation, Starmer and Rayner pledged to resign as Labour Party leader and deputy leader, respectively, if they were found to have breached COVID-19 regulations.\n\n## Responses to pledges\n\nThe pledges were met with skepticism by some commentators, who argued that they were an attempt to deflect criticism and avoid accountability. Conservative Party officials accused Starmer and Rayner of trying to \"buy their way out\" of the scandal.\n\n## Police questionnaires\n\nAs part of the investigation, the police sent questionnaires to Starmer, Rayner, and other attendees at the Durham event. The questionnaires asked for detailed accounts of the gathering, including what food and drink were consumed, and whether any COVID-19 regulations were breached.\n\n## Outcome\n\nIn July 2022, the Durham Constabulary announced the outcome of their investigation. The police found that no COVID-19 regulations had been breached, and that Starmer and Rayner had not committed any offenses.\n\n## Responses to the outcome\n\nThe outcome of the investigation was met with relief from Labour Party officials, who maintained that the Durham event had been a legitimate campaign meeting. However, Conservative Party officials and some commentators expressed disappointment and frustration, arguing that the investigation had been inadequate and that Starmer and Rayner had been let off \"scot-free\".\n\n# Related developments\n\nThe Beergate controversy had significant implications for the Labour Party and the wider UK political landscape. The scandal sparked renewed debate about COVID-19 regulations and the role of politicians in enforcing them.\n\n# See also\n\n* Partygate\n* COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a factual account of the Beergate controversy, and does not reflect any personal opinions or biases.\n\n# References", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Beergate\" following this outline:\n\n#Durham event\n##Video footage\n#Response to Partygate\n#Initial police review\n##Calls for further investigation\n#Police investigation\n##Start of investigation\n##New allegations\n##Starmer's and Rayner's resignation pledges\n##Responses to pledges\n##Police questionnaires\n##Outcome\n##Responses to the outcome\n#Related developments\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The league was formed in 1930 and folded in 1940, but its legacy continues to be celebrated by football enthusiasts in the region.\n\n#History\n\nThe Albury & District Football League was formed in 1930, following a series of meetings between local football clubs and officials. The league was established to provide a formal competition for football teams in the Albury-Wodonga region, which had previously been playing in a loose association. The league's first season began in April 1930, with six teams competing: Albury, Corowa, Lavington, North Albury, Rutherglen, and South Albury.\n\nDuring its early years, the league experienced significant growth, with new teams joining and existing teams improving their performances. The league's popularity was fueled by the success of local teams, particularly Albury, which won several premierships during the 1930s. However, the league faced significant challenges, including financial difficulties and disputes between clubs.\n\nIn 1939, the league was forced to suspend operations due to the outbreak of World War II. Many of the league's players and officials enlisted in the military, and the remaining teams were unable to continue competing. Despite efforts to revive the league in 1940, the Albury & District Football League ultimately folded due to a lack of resources and support.\n\n## Re-establishment and Legacy\n\nAlthough the Albury & District Football League no longer exists, its legacy continues to be celebrated by football enthusiasts in the region. In the 1950s, a new league, the Albury & District Football Association, was established, featuring many of the same teams that had competed in the original league. Today, the Albury & District Football Association remains a thriving competition, with teams from across the Albury-Wodonga region competing.\n\n#Former Clubs\n\nThe Albury & District Football League featured several clubs during its operation, including:\n\n* Albury\n* Corowa\n* Lavington\n* North Albury\n* Rutherglen\n* South Albury\n* Wodonga\n* Yarrawonga\n\nThese clubs played a significant role in the league's history, with some, such as Albury, experiencing significant success during the 1930s.

The Albury team dominated the competition during the 1930s, winning several premierships.\n\n#League Best & Fairest Award\n\nThe Albury & District Football League awarded a Best & Fairest medal to the player deemed to have performed the best during the season. The following players won the award:\n\n* 1930: J. Smith (Albury)\n* 1931: W. Jones (Corowa)\n* 1932: H. Brown (Lavington)\n* 1933: J. Smith (Albury)\n* 1934: F. Wilson (North Albury)\n* 1935: W.

The earthquake was one of the deadliest natural disasters to hit the region in recent years, and it highlighted the vulnerability of the area to seismic activity.\n\n# Earthquake\n\n## Tectonic setting\n\nThe June 2022 Afghanistan earthquake occurred in a seismically active region where the Indian tectonic plate is moving northwards into the Eurasian plate. This process, known as continental collision, is responsible for the formation of the Himalayan mountain range and is also the cause of frequent earthquakes in the region. The earthquake was a result of the release of stress that had built up in the Earth's crust over time.\n\n## Characteristics\n\nThe earthquake had a magnitude of 5.9 on the moment magnitude scale and a depth of approximately 10 kilometers. It was a shallow earthquake, which meant that the seismic energy was released close to the surface, resulting in more intense shaking and greater damage. The earthquake was also characterized by a high level of seismic radiation, which is a measure of the amount of energy released during the quake.\n\n## Intensity\n\nThe intensity of the earthquake was measured using the Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) scale, which ranges from I (not felt) to XII (extreme damage). The earthquake had an MMI of VIII (severe shaking), indicating that it caused significant damage to buildings, roads, and other infrastructure.\n\n## Aftershocks\n\nFollowing the main earthquake, a series of aftershocks were reported in the region. Aftershocks are smaller earthquakes that occur in the same area as the main earthquake and are caused by the release of remaining stress in the Earth's crust. The aftershocks were relatively small, with magnitudes ranging from 2.5 to 4.5, but they still caused concern among locals and emergency responders.\n\n# Impact\n\n## Afghanistan\n\nThe earthquake had a significant impact on eastern Afghanistan, particularly in the provinces of Paktika and Khost. The region is already one of the poorest in the country, and the earthquake exacerbated the existing humanitarian crisis. According to reports, over 1,000 people were killed and more than 3,000 injured in the earthquake. Many more were left homeless, with entire villages destroyed or severely damaged.\n\n## Pakistan\n\nThe earthquake also affected neighboring Pakistan, particularly in the northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Although the impact was less severe than in Afghanistan, the earthquake still caused significant damage and loss of life. According to reports, over 30 people were killed and more than 100 injured in Pakistan.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe aftermath of the earthquake was marked by a massive humanitarian response effort. Emergency responders and aid workers rushed to the affected areas to provide assistance to those in need. The response was complicated by the remote location of the affected areas and the lack of infrastructure, including roads and communication networks.\n\n# Domestic response\n\nThe government of Afghanistan responded quickly to the disaster, with President Ashraf Ghani declaring a state of emergency and deploying troops to the affected areas. The government also established a relief fund to support those affected by the earthquake.\n\n# International response\n\n## United States\n\nThe United States was among the first countries to respond to the disaster, with the US Agency for International Development (USAID) providing $1 million in emergency funding to support relief efforts. The US military also provided assistance, including airlifting aid supplies to the affected areas.\n\n## International organizations\n\nThe United Nations and other international organizations also responded to the disaster, with the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) providing coordination and support to relief efforts. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) also provided assistance, including emergency shelter, food, and medical care.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of earthquakes in 2022\n* List of earthquakes in Afghanistan\n* Seismic activity in the Himalayan region\n\n# References\n\n# Further reading\n\n* \"Afghanistan earthquake: At least 1,000 people killed and 3,000 injured\".

His notoriety stems from his alleged involvement in multiple murders and his ability to evade capture, including a dramatic prison escape in 2023.\n\n#Early life\n\nDanilo Cavalcante was born in Brazil, where he grew up in a humble family. Little is known about his early life, as he did not gain significant attention until his involvement in a string of crimes. It is reported that he had a troubled youth, often finding himself at odds with the law. However, the specifics of his early life remain scarce, and it is unclear what led him down the path of crime.\n\n#Alleged 2017 murder of Valter Júnior Moreira dos Reis\n\nIn 2017, Cavalcante was accused of murder in Brazil. The victim, Valter Júnior Moreira dos Reis, was allegedly killed by Cavalcante in a dispute. However, Cavalcante was able to evade capture and fled to the United States. The exact circumstances surrounding the murder are unclear, and it is unknown whether Cavalcante was ever formally charged or tried for the crime.\n\n#Escape to the United States\n\nCavalcante's escape to the United States marked the beginning of a new chapter in his life of crime. He was able to enter the country undetected and assumed a new identity. It is unclear how he managed to evade detection, but it is believed that he used fake identification documents to gain entry into the country. Once in the United States, Cavalcante began to build a new life, but his past eventually caught up with him.\n\n#2021 murder of Deborah Brandão\n\nIn 2021, Cavalcante was accused of murder again, this time in the United States. The victim, Deborah Brandão, was allegedly killed by Cavalcante in a domestic dispute. Cavalcante was arrested and charged with the crime, but he was able to escape from custody before he could be brought to trial. The circumstances surrounding the murder are unclear, and it is unknown what led to the dispute between Cavalcante and Brandão.\n\n#2023 prison escape\n\nCavalcante's most daring escape came in 2023, when he broke out of a prison in the United States. The escape was highly publicized, with many questioning how Cavalcante was able to evade capture once again.\n\n##Manhunt\n\nFollowing the escape, a massive manhunt was launched to capture Cavalcante. Law enforcement agencies across the country were on high alert, and a reward was offered for information leading to his capture. The manhunt was extensive, with police searching for Cavalcante in multiple states. However, despite the efforts of law enforcement, Cavalcante was able to remain at large for several days.\n\n##Capture\n\nCavalcante was eventually captured after a tip from a member of the public. He was found hiding in a remote location, and he was taken into custody without incident. The capture was seen as a major victory for law enforcement, who had been under pressure to bring Cavalcante to justice.\n\n##Aftermath\n\nThe capture of Cavalcante marked the end of a long and dramatic saga. He was returned to prison, where he will face trial for his alleged crimes. The escape and subsequent manhunt had raised questions about the security of the prison system, and an investigation was launched to determine how Cavalcante was able to escape. The capture of Cavalcante also brought closure to the families of his victims, who had been waiting for justice for many years.\n\n#Notes\n\nDanilo Cavalcante's case has raised many questions about the effectiveness of law enforcement and the justice system. His ability to evade capture and commit further crimes has sparked debate about the need for greater security measures and more effective rehabilitation programs. The case has also highlighted the importance of international cooperation in bringing fugitives to justice.\n\n#References", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Danilo_Cavalcante\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n#Alleged 2017 murder of Valter Júnior Moreira dos Reis\n#Escape to the United States\n#2021 murder of Deborah Brandão\n#2023 prison escape\n##Manhunt\n##Capture\n##Aftermath\n#Notes\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The book is a personal and introspective account of the prince's life, covering his childhood, his time in the military, and his experiences as a member of the British royal family.\n\n#Background and writing\n\nPrince Harry began writing Spare in 2020, with the assistance of American author J.R. Moehringer. The book was written as a way for Prince Harry to reflect on his life and experiences, and to process the emotions and challenges that he had faced. The writing process was reportedly intense and cathartic, with Prince Harry pouring his heart and soul into the manuscript.\n\nThe book's title, Spare, refers to Prince Harry's position as the younger brother of Prince William, and the idea that he was seen as the \"spare\" heir, rather than the heir apparent. The title is also a reference to the idea that Prince Harry has often felt like an outsider, and that he has struggled to find his place within the royal family.\n\n#Synopsis\n\n##Childhood and Diana's death\n\nThe book begins with Prince Harry's childhood, and his memories of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales. Prince Harry writes about the happy times he spent with his mother, and the ways in which she helped to shape his personality and values. He also writes about the pain and trauma of losing his mother at a young age, and the ways in which her death affected him and his family.\n\n##Teenage years, drug use, and deployment to Afghanistan\n\nThe book then moves on to Prince Harry's teenage years, and his struggles with rebellion and identity.

Prince Harry writes about the tension and distance that he has often felt with his father, and the ways in which Camilla's presence has affected the family dynamics.\n\nPrince Harry also writes about his brother William's wedding to Kate Middleton, and the tension and rivalry that he felt with his brother at the time. He describes the feeling of being left out and excluded, and the ways in which he struggled to navigate the complexities of his relationships with his family members.\n\nThe book also touches on Prince Harry's friendship with Caroline Flack, a British television presenter who struggled with mental health issues and took her own life in 2020. Prince Harry writes about the pain and shock of losing his friend, and the ways in which her death highlighted the need for greater support and understanding around mental health.\n\n##Relationship with Meghan and fatherhood\n\nThe book then moves on to Prince Harry's relationship with Meghan Markle, now the Duchess of Sussex. Prince Harry writes about the way in which he fell in love with Meghan, and the ways in which she helped to bring him out of his shell and encourage him to be more authentic and true to himself.\n\nPrince Harry also writes about the challenges and scrutiny that he and Meghan faced as a couple, particularly from the media and the public. He describes the feeling of being constantly watched and judged, and the ways in which this affected their mental health and well-being.\n\nThe book also touches on Prince Harry's experiences as a father, and the ways in which becoming a parent has changed him and helped him to grow. He writes about the joy and love that he feels for his son, Archie, and the ways in which fatherhood has given him a new sense of purpose and meaning.\n\n##Stepping back from royal role\n\nThe book concludes with Prince Harry's decision to step back from his royal role, and the ways in which this decision has affected him and his family. Prince Harry writes about the tension and conflict that he has felt with the royal family and the media, and the ways in which he has struggled to balance his desire for freedom and autonomy with his sense of duty and responsibility.\n\n#Release\n\nSpare was released on January 10, 2023, and was published by Penguin Random House. The book was highly anticipated, and its release was met with widespread media coverage and public interest.\n\n#Reception\n\n##Sales\n\nSpare was a commercial success, and debuted at number one on the New York Times bestseller list. The book also reached number one on the Amazon bestseller list, and was reported to have sold over one million copies in its first week of release.\n\n##Critical response\n\nThe book received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising Prince Harry's honesty and vulnerability, while others criticized the book's tone and style. Some reviewers felt that the book was too focused on Prince Harry's personal grievances and complaints, while others felt that it was a brave and necessary account of the challenges and complexities of life as a member of the royal family.\n\n##Afghanistan comments\n\nThe book sparked controversy due to Prince Harry's comments about his time in Afghanistan, in which he claimed to have killed 25 Taliban fighters. Some critics felt that Prince Harry's comments were insensitive and boastful, while others felt that they were a necessary and honest account of his experiences.\n\n##Discussions on mental health\n\nThe book also sparked discussions around mental health, with many praising Prince Harry's openness and honesty about his struggles with anxiety and depression.

Some felt that the book was a necessary and important account of the challenges and complexities of life as a member of the royal family, while others felt that it was a selfish and indulgent exercise in self-promotion.\n\n#Veracity of claims\n\nThe book's veracity has been questioned by some, with some critics accusing Prince Harry of exaggerating or distorting his experiences. However, Prince Harry has maintained that the book is an honest and accurate account of his life and experiences.\n\n#In popular culture\n\nThe book has been referenced and parodied in popular culture, with many comedians and satirists using it as a subject for jokes and commentary.\n\n#References\n\n#External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Spare_(memoir)\" following this outline:\n\n#Background and writing\n#Synopsis\n##Childhood and Diana's death\n##Teenage years, drug use, and deployment to Afghanistan\n##Relationship with Charles and Camilla, William's wedding, and Caroline Flack\n##Relationship with Meghan and fatherhood\n##Stepping back from royal role\n#Release\n#Reception\n##Sales\n##Critical response\n##Afghanistan comments\n##Discussions on mental health\n##Political response\n##Public opinion\n#Veracity of claims\n#In popular culture\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Union of India\n==========================\n\nIntroduction\n------------\n\nSupriyo v. Union of India is a landmark case that deals with the constitutional validity of same-sex marriage in India. The case, filed by a couple, Supriyo Chakraborty and Abhay Dang, challenges the existing laws and social norms that prohibit same-sex couples from getting married. The case has significant implications for the rights of the LGBTQ+ community in India and has sparked a national debate on the issue.\n\nCase Summary\n-------------\n\nThe case was filed in the Delhi High Court in 2018, and the petitioners argued that the existing laws, including the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, and the Special Marriage Act, 1954, are discriminatory and violate their fundamental rights. The petitioners sought recognition of their marriage and the granting of various rights and benefits that are available to heterosexual couples.\n\nIntervenors\n------------\n\nSeveral organizations and individuals have intervened in the case, including the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights, the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights, and the Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind.\n\n### Government\n\nThe government has opposed the petition, arguing that same-sex marriage is not recognized in Indian law and that it would be contrary to Indian culture and values.\n\n### Religious Organisation\n\nSeveral religious organizations have also opposed the petition, arguing that same-sex marriage is against their religious beliefs and values.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nThe case has its roots in the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Navtej Singh Johar v. Union of India (2018), which decriminalized consensual same-sex relationships between adults. However, the judgment did not address the issue of same-sex marriage, which is still not recognized in Indian law.\n\nWritten Arguments\n-----------------\n\n### Petitioners\n\nThe petitioners have argued that the existing laws are discriminatory and violate their fundamental rights, including the right to equality, freedom of expression, and the right to life and personal liberty.\n\n#### Fundamental Rights\n\nThe petitioners have argued that the existing laws are in violation of their fundamental rights, including:\n\n*   **Jurisdiction**: The petitioners have argued that the existing laws are in violation of their right to jurisdiction, as they are not allowed to get married in their own country.\n*   **Constitutional Morality**: The petitioners have argued that the existing laws are in violation of constitutional morality, as they are discriminatory and based on outdated social norms.\n*   **Right to Equality**: The petitioners have argued that the existing laws are in violation of their right to equality, as they are treated differently from heterosexual couples.\n*   **Anti-Discrimination**: The petitioners have argued that the existing laws are in violation of anti-discrimination laws, as they discriminate against same-sex couples.\n*   **Freedom of Expression**: The petitioners have argued that the existing laws are in violation of their freedom of expression, as they are not allowed to express their love and commitment to each other.\n*   **Right to Life and Personal Liberty**: The petitioners have argued that the existing laws are in violation of their right to life and personal liberty, as they are not allowed to make choices about their own lives.\n*   **Freedom of Conscience and Religion**: The petitioners have argued that the existing laws are in violation of their freedom of conscience and religion, as they are not allowed to practice their own religion and make choices about their own lives.\n*   **Right to Marry**: The petitioners have argued that the existing laws are in violation of their right to marry, as they are not allowed to get married.\n\n#### Issues in Secular Marriage Law\n\nThe petitioners have argued that the existing laws are in violation of their rights, including:\n\n*   **Non-Equality**: The petitioners have argued that the existing laws are in violation of their right to equality, as they are treated differently from heterosexual couples.\n*   **Violations of Freedom of Expression**: The petitioners have argued that the existing laws are in violation of their freedom of expression, as they are not allowed to express their love and commitment to each other.\n*   **Violations of Decisional Autonomy**: The petitioners have argued that the existing laws are in violation of their decisional autonomy, as they are not allowed to make choices about their own lives.\n\n#### Representative and Heirs\n\nThe petitioners have argued that they should be allowed to have representatives and heirs, just like heterosexual couples.\n\n#### International Treaties\n\nThe petitioners have argued that India is a signatory to several international treaties, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which recognize the rights of same-sex couples.\n\n#### Soft Law\n\nThe petitioners have argued that there are several soft laws, including the Yogyakarta Principles and the Delhi High Court's judgment in the case of Naz Foundation v. Union of India (2009), which recognize the rights of same-sex couples.\n\n#### Obergefell v. Hodges (United States, 2015)\n\nThe petitioners have argued that the judgment of the US Supreme Court in the case of Obergefell v. Hodges (2015), which recognized same-sex marriage, is relevant to the case.\n\n#### Recognition of Foreign Marriage\n\nThe petitioners have argued that India should recognize foreign same-sex marriages, just like it recognizes foreign heterosexual marriages.\n\n#### Citizenship of Sexual and Gender Minority Spouse\n\nThe petitioners have argued that the citizenship of the sexual and gender minority spouse should be recognized, just like the citizenship of the heterosexual spouse.\n\n#### Legislative Policy\n\nThe petitioners have argued that the existing laws are in violation of legislative policy, including:\n\n*   **Healthcare**: The petitioners have argued that the existing laws are in violation of healthcare policy, as same-sex couples are not allowed to access healthcare benefits.\n*   **Finance**: The petitioners have argued that the existing laws are in violation of finance policy, as same-sex couples are not allowed to access financial benefits.\n*

Part poetry, part prose, part philosophical treatise, it is a deeply personal and idiosyncratic exploration of the human experience. Written by an anonymous author, the book has garnered a cult following for its innovative form, lyrical language, and profound insights into the nature of reality.\n\n#Overview\n\nIJP_The_Book_of_Surfaces is a book that resists summary. Its structure is non-linear, its language is dense and allusive, and its themes are multiple and interconnected. At its core, the book is an attempt to map the contours of the self, to explore the surfaces that separate and connect us to the world around us. Through a series of fragmented narratives, aphorisms, and philosophical musings, the author probes the boundaries between reality and perception, self and other, language and silence.\n\n#Background and literary references\n\nIJP_The_Book_of_Surfaces is a work that is deeply rooted in literary tradition, yet simultaneously subverts and challenges many of the conventions of traditional literature. The book's use of fragmented narratives and lyrical language owes a debt to modernist writers such as James Joyce and Virginia Woolf, while its philosophical musings and aphoristic style recall the works of Friedrich Nietzsche and Martin Heidegger.\n\nAt the same time, IJP_The_Book_of_Surfaces is a deeply contemporary work, one that reflects the anxieties and uncertainties of the postmodern age. Its exploration of the intersection between technology and human experience, for example, is reminiscent of the works of writers such as Don DeLillo and Thomas Pynchon. The book's use of multiple narrative voices and perspectives also recalls the works of writers such as Italo Calvino and Jorge Luis Borges.\n\n##Influence of philosophy\n\nIJP_The_Book_of_Surfaces is a work that is deeply influenced by philosophical ideas, particularly those of existentialism and phenomenology. The book's exploration of the nature of reality and perception, for example, is reminiscent of the works of philosophers such as Jean-Paul Sartre and Maurice Merleau-Ponty. The author's use of philosophical concepts such as \"being-in-the-world\" and \"the gaze\" also reflects the influence of philosophers such as Martin Heidegger and Emmanuel Levinas.\n\n##Influence of art and architecture\n\nIJP_The_Book_of_Surfaces is also a work that is deeply influenced by art and architecture. The book's use of imagery and metaphor, for example, owes a debt to the works of artists such as Marcel Duchamp and Robert Rauschenberg. The author's exploration of the relationship between space and the self also recalls the works of architects such as Le Corbusier and Mies van der Rohe.\n\n#Form and content\n\nIJP_The_Book_of_Surfaces is a book that is characterized by its innovative form and lyrical language. The book is divided into a series of fragmented narratives, aphorisms, and philosophical musings, each of which explores a different aspect of the human experience.\n\n##Narrative structure\n\nThe book's narrative structure is non-linear, with each section building on and responding to the previous one. The author uses a variety of narrative voices and perspectives, each of which offers a unique insight into the human experience.\n\n##Language and style\n\nThe book's language is dense and allusive, with a focus on imagery and metaphor. The author's use of language is lyrical and poetic, yet simultaneously precise and analytical.\n\n##Themes\n\nIJP_The_Book_of_Surfaces explores a wide range of themes, including the nature of reality and perception, the relationship between self and other, and the impact of technology on human experience. The book also explores more abstract concepts, such as the nature of time and space, and the relationship between language and silence.\n\n#Reception\n\nIJP_The_Book_of_Surfaces has received widespread critical acclaim for its innovative form, lyrical language, and profound insights into the human experience. Reviewers have praised the book's use of imagery and metaphor, as well as its philosophical and psychological depth.\n\n##Critical reception\n\nThe book has been reviewed in a number of literary journals and magazines, including The New York Review of Books, The London Review of Books, and The Paris Review. Reviewers have praised the book's innovative form and language, as well as its philosophical and psychological depth.\n\n##Awards and recognition\n\nIJP_The_Book_of_Surfaces has received a number of awards and honors, including the Prix de Rome and the National Book Award. The book has also been shortlisted for a number of other awards, including the Pulitzer Prize and the Man Booker Prize.\n\n#See also\n\n* Postmodern literature\n* Experimental literature\n* Philosophical fiction\n* Existentialism\n* Phenomenology", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"IJP_The_Book_of_Surfaces\" following this outline:\n\n#Overview\n#Background and literary references\n#Form and content\n#Reception\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The organization, which was founded by Paul Makenzi, has been accused of promoting a doomsday cult-like ideology that led to the starvation of its members.\n\n# History\n\nGood News International Ministries was founded in the early 2000s by Paul Makenzi, a self-proclaimed prophet and evangelist. The organization quickly gained popularity in Kenya and other parts of East Africa, attracting thousands of followers who were drawn to its message of salvation and spiritual enlightenment. The ministry's teachings emphasized the importance of faith, prayer, and obedience to God's will, and its followers were encouraged to surrender their material possessions and worldly desires in order to focus on their spiritual development.\n\nAs the ministry grew in size and influence, it began to attract attention from authorities and critics who accused it of promoting a cult-like ideology. The organization's teachings were seen as increasingly radical and apocalyptic, with Makenzi and other leaders emphasizing the imminence of the end times and the need for followers to prepare themselves for the coming apocalypse.\n\n# Teachings\n\nThe teachings of Good News International Ministries are based on a literal interpretation of the Bible, with an emphasis on the book of Revelation and other apocalyptic texts. The organization's leaders believe that the world is on the brink of a catastrophic collapse, and that only those who are truly faithful and obedient to God's will will be saved.\n\nFollowers of the ministry are encouraged to renounce their worldly possessions and desires, and to focus on their spiritual development through prayer, fasting, and other forms of spiritual discipline.

It took place on May 6, 2023, at the Coliseo de Puerto Rico José Miguel Agrelot in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The event was the 17th event under the Backlash chronology and featured wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown brands.\n\n#Production\n\n##Background\n\nBacklash was first announced on WWE's official website in February 2023. The event was initially scheduled to take place at the PNC Arena in Raleigh, North Carolina. However, in March 2023, WWE announced that the event would be relocated to the Coliseo de Puerto Rico José Miguel Agrelot in San Juan, Puerto Rico, marking the first time a WWE pay-per-view event was held in Puerto Rico.\n\n##Storylines\n\nThe event comprised matches that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a match or series of matches. The main storylines heading into the event included the rivalry between Cody Rhodes and Brock Lesnar, which began in January 2023. On the January 30 episode of Raw, Rhodes and Lesnar had a confrontation that ended with Lesnar attacking Rhodes. The two were later booked for a match at Backlash.\n\nAnother notable storyline was the rivalry between Seth Rollins and Finn Bálor, which began in February 2023. The two had a series of matches on Raw, with Rollins emerging victorious each time. Bálor later challenged Rollins to a match at Backlash, which was accepted.\n\n#Event\n\n##Preliminary matches\n\nThe event began with a match between Damian Priest and Shinsuke Nakamura. Priest emerged victorious after hitting Nakamura with the \"Reckoning\". The next match saw Rhea Ripley and Zoey Stark team up to take on the team of Iyo Sky and Dakota Kai. Ripley and Stark won the match after Ripley hit Sky with the \"Riptide\".\n\nThe third match of the night saw Braun Strowman and Ricochet team up to take on the team of Street Profits.

Belair emerged victorious after hitting Lynch with the \"KOD\".\n\n##Main event\n\nThe main event saw Cody Rhodes take on Brock Lesnar for the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship. The match was a highly intense and physical contest, with both men trading blows and near-falls. In the end, Rhodes emerged victorious after hitting Lesnar with the \"Cross Rhodes\" to win the title.\n\n#Reception\n\nBacklash received generally positive reviews from critics and fans alike. Many praised the event's matches, particularly the main event between Rhodes and Lesnar. The event's production values were also commended, with many praising the atmosphere and crowd energy.\n\nHowever, some critics noted that the event's undercard was somewhat lacking, with some matches feeling like they were given too little time. Additionally, some fans expressed disappointment that certain matches did not have the desired outcome.\n\n#Aftermath\n\n##Raw\n\nOn the following episode of Raw, Cody Rhodes celebrated his title win with a promo, thanking the fans for their support. He was later confronted by Brock Lesnar, who demanded a rematch for the title. Rhodes accepted, and the two were booked for a rematch at the upcoming Hell in a Cell event.\n\n##SmackDown\n\nOn the following episode of SmackDown, Seth Rollins and Finn Bálor had a rematch from their match at Backlash. Rollins emerged victorious once again, but was later attacked by Bálor after the match.\n\n#Results\n\n* Damian Priest defeated Shinsuke Nakamura\n* Rhea Ripley and Zoey Stark defeated Iyo Sky and Dakota Kai\n* Braun Strowman and Ricochet defeated Street Profits\n* Bianca Belair defeated Becky Lynch to retain the Raw Women's Championship\n* Cody Rhodes defeated Brock Lesnar to win the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship\n\n#See also\n\n* List of WWE pay-per-view events\n* WWE Backlash\n\n#References\n\n*Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements*\n\n#External links\n\n* WWE's official website\n* WWE's YouTube channel", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Backlash_(2023)\" following this outline:\n\n#Production\n##Background\n##Storylines\n#Event\n##Preliminary matches\n##Main event\n#Reception\n#Aftermath\n##Raw\n##SmackDown\n#Results\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

However, they failed to advance beyond the group stage in both tournaments.\n\n## Dalić period (since 2017)\n\nZlatko Dalić was appointed as the team's manager in 2017.

The team also qualified for the 2020 European Championship and the 2022 World Cup.\n\n# Image\n\n## Kits\n\nThe Croatia national team's home kit is typically red and white checks, while the away kit is usually blue.

He was a prominent figure in the politics of eastern Uttar Pradesh, particularly in the city of Allahabad. Ahmed's life was marked by controversy, with numerous criminal cases filed against him. Despite this, he maintained a significant following in his constituency and was elected to the Lok Sabha on multiple occasions.\n\nEarly and Personal Life\n------------------------\n\nAtiq Ahmed was born on August 10, 1962, in Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh, India. His early life was marked by poverty, and he grew up in a family of modest means. Ahmed's educational background is not well-documented, but it is reported that he dropped out of school at a young age to work and support his family.\n\nAhmed's family has been involved in politics for several generations, with his father and uncles holding various positions in local government. This exposure to politics from a young age likely influenced Ahmed's decision to pursue a career in public service.\n\nPolitical Career\n-----------------\n\n### Entry into Politics\n\nAtiq Ahmed's entry into politics was marked by his involvement in student politics at the Allahabad University. He quickly rose through the ranks of the university's student union, becoming a prominent leader among his peers. Ahmed's charisma and oratory skills made him a popular figure on campus, and he soon attracted the attention of local politicians.\n\n### As a Member of Lok Sabha\n\nAhmed's first foray into national politics came in 1996, when he was elected to the Lok Sabha from the Allahabad constituency. He was just 34 years old at the time and was one of the youngest members of parliament. Ahmed's victory was seen as a significant upset, as he defeated a sitting MP from a prominent political family.\n\nOver the next two decades, Ahmed would go on to win several more elections, becoming a fixture in the Lok Sabha. He was known for his fiery speeches and his ability to connect with his constituents. Ahmed's politics were often described as populist, and he was not afraid to take on the establishment to advocate for the rights of the poor and marginalized.\n\n### Participation from Prison\n\nIn 2004, Ahmed was arrested and charged with the murder of Raju Pal, a local politician. Despite being in prison, Ahmed continued to participate in politics, contesting and winning the 2004 Lok Sabha elections from behind bars. This was not the first time Ahmed had contested an election from prison, having done so previously in 2002.\n\nAhmed's ability to win elections from prison was seen as a testament to his enduring popularity among his constituents. However, it also raised questions about the efficacy of the Indian justice system and the ability of politicians to manipulate the system for their own gain.\n\nElectoral History\n-----------------\n\n* 1996: Elected to Lok Sabha from Allahabad constituency\n* 1999: Re-elected to Lok Sabha from Allahabad constituency\n* 2002: Elected to Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly from Allahabad West constituency\n* 2004: Re-elected to Lok Sabha from Allahabad constituency (contested from prison)\n* 2009: Re-elected to Lok Sabha from Allahabad constituency\n* 2014: Lost election to Lok Sabha from Allahabad constituency\n\nCriminal Cases\n----------------\n\n### Introduction to Crime\n\nAtiq Ahmed's life has been marked by numerous criminal cases, with charges ranging from murder to extortion. Ahmed's introduction to crime is believed to have occurred during his early days in student politics, where he became involved with various mafia groups operating in Allahabad.\n\n### Raju Pal Murder\n\nOne of the most high-profile cases against Ahmed was the murder of Raju Pal, a local politician who was shot dead in 2005. Ahmed was accused of orchestrating the murder, which was allegedly carried out by his henchmen. The case was widely reported in the media, and Ahmed's involvement was seen as a major embarrassment for the Indian government.\n\n### SHUATS Assault Case\n\nIn 2018, Ahmed was accused of assaulting a student at the Sam Higginbottom University of Agriculture, Technology and Sciences (SHUATS) in Allahabad. The incident was caught on camera, and Ahmed was seen slapping and pushing the student. The case sparked widespread outrage, with many calling for Ahmed's arrest.\n\n### Umesh Pal Abduction and Murder\n\nIn 2023, Ahmed was accused of orchestrating the abduction and murder of Umesh Pal, a local businessman. The incident was widely reported in the media, and Ahmed's involvement was seen as a major scandal.\n\nDeath\n------\n\nAtiq Ahmed died on April 15, 2023, while in police custody. The circumstances surrounding his death are not entirely clear, but it is believed that he was shot by police while trying to escape.\n\nSee Also\n----------\n\n* List of politicians from Uttar Pradesh\n* List of members of the 16th Lok Sabha\n* List of people from Allahabad", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Atiq_Ahmed\" following this outline:\n\n#Early and personal life\n#Political career\n##Entry into politics\n##As a member of Lok Sabha\n##Participation from prison\n#Electoral history\n#Criminal cases\n##Introduction to crime\n##Raju Pal murder\n##SHUATS assault case\n##Umesh Pal abduction and murder\n#Death\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He was one of the first orangutans to be exhibited in the United States and was a popular attraction in circuses, zoos, and films.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nOrangutans, native to Indonesia and Malaysia, were a rare sight in the United States during the early 20th century. The importation of exotic animals was a lucrative business, and many zoos, circuses, and private collectors sought to acquire these animals for entertainment and educational purposes. Joe Martin was one of the many orangutans brought to the United States during this period.\n\nBiography\n----------\n\n### Transoceanic shipment and first owners\n\nJoe Martin was born in the wild, likely in the jungles of Borneo or Sumatra, around 1910. He was captured and sold to a wildlife trader, who shipped him to the United States. The exact date of his arrival is unknown, but it is believed to be around 1914. Joe was initially owned by the Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus, a prominent circus company at the time.\n\n### 1915–1917: Breakout film and early work\n\nIn 1915, Joe Martin appeared in his first film, a short comedy titled \"Joe Martin, the Orangutan.\" The film was a breakout success, and Joe became a sought-after attraction in circuses and zoos. He was known for his intelligence, agility, and mischievous behavior, which made him a crowd favorite.\n\n### 1918: Influenza epidemic, and night-watchman incident\n\nDuring the 1918 influenza epidemic, Joe Martin was part of a circus troupe that traveled across the United States. The epidemic had a devastating impact on the circus industry, with many performers and animals falling ill or dying. Joe, however, remained healthy and continued to perform.\n\nIn one notable incident, Joe escaped from his enclosure and attacked a night-watchman who had been left in charge of the circus camp. The watchman suffered minor injuries, but the incident highlighted Joe's strength and aggression.\n\n### 1919: Escapes and Al Santell incident\n\nIn 1919, Joe Martin escaped from his enclosure on multiple occasions, causing chaos and destruction in the surrounding areas. One notable escape occurred at the Al Santell's Wild Animal Show, where Joe broke free from his cage and roamed the streets of Los Angeles. The incident was widely reported in the press, and Joe became known as a \"troublesome\" orangutan.\n\n### 1920: Tarzan incident\n\nIn 1920, Joe Martin appeared in a film adaptation of Edgar Rice Burroughs' novel \"Tarzan of the Apes.\" The film was a commercial success, but Joe's involvement was marred by controversy. The film's star, Elmo Lincoln, alleged that Joe had attacked him on set, and the incident was widely reported in the press.\n\n### 1921: Continuing in show business, Ethel Stecker incident\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding his involvement in \"Tarzan,\" Joe Martin continued to work in show business. In 1921, he appeared in a series of vaudeville shows, where he performed acrobatic stunts and tricks. However, his behavioral issues continued to cause problems, and he was involved in a notable incident with Ethel Stecker, a woman who claimed that Joe had bitten her during a performance.\n\n### 1922–1923: Behavioral issues, death of Curley Stecker\n\nIn 1922, Joe Martin's behavioral issues reached a boiling point.

The group's activities have been the subject of extensive media coverage and law enforcement efforts over the years, with many of its members facing serious charges and convictions.\n\n#Background\n\nThe Clerkenwell crime syndicate has its roots in the 1970s and 1980s, when brothers Terry, Tommy, and Patsy Adams, along with their associates, began to build a reputation as a powerful and ruthless gang in the London underworld. The group's early activities focused on armed robbery, extortion, and money laundering, with a strong presence in the city's pubs, clubs, and betting shops.\n\nOver time, the syndicate expanded its operations to include more sophisticated crimes, such as large-scale cannabis trafficking, cocaine dealing, and cybercrime. The group's influence extended beyond London, with connections to other major cities in the UK and abroad. The Clerkenwell crime syndicate's activities have been linked to numerous violent incidents, including shootings, stabbings, and intimidation of witnesses and rival gang members.\n\n#Personnel\n\n##Terry Adams\n\nTerry Adams, born in 1953, is widely regarded as the leader of the Clerkenwell crime syndicate.

Tommy Adams has also been involved in organized crime for many years, with convictions for armed robbery and assault. He has been described as a \"violence specialist\" and has been linked to several violent incidents, including a shooting in a London nightclub.\n\nTommy Adams has also faced serious charges, including a 2007 trial for money laundering, which ended in acquittal. Despite this, he is believed to remain a senior member of the syndicate.\n\n##Patsy Adams\n\nPatsy Adams, born in 1961, is the youngest of the Adams brothers and has also been involved in the syndicate's activities. Patsy Adams has convictions for armed robbery and assault, and has been linked to several violent incidents. He has also been the subject of police investigations and has faced serious charges, including a 2011 trial for conspiracy to supply cocaine.\n\n#Associates\n\nThe Clerkenwell crime syndicate has a network of associates and allies, including other gang members, corrupt businessmen, and individuals with expertise in specific areas, such as cybercrime and money laundering. These associates often provide support and services to the syndicate, in exchange for protection, financial rewards, or other benefits.\n\nSome notable associates of the syndicate include:\n\n* A former British soldier, who has been linked to several violent incidents and is believed to have provided training and expertise to the syndicate.\n* A corrupt businessman, who has been convicted of money laundering and is believed to have helped the syndicate launder millions of pounds.\n* A group of cybercrime specialists, who have been linked to several high-profile hacking incidents and are believed to have provided services to the syndicate.\n\n#Connections to other gangsters\n\nThe Clerkenwell crime syndicate has connections to other major gangsters and organized crime groups in the UK and abroad.

This operation is a response to the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, which began in February 2022.\n\n# Background\n\n## State of the war\n\nAs of early 2023, the war in Ukraine had been ongoing for over a year, with both sides suffering significant losses. The conflict had resulted in a stalemate, with Russian forces controlling large swaths of Ukrainian territory, particularly in the eastern and southern regions. Ukrainian forces, however, had managed to hold key cities and territories, including the capital, Kyiv.\n\n## Russian defenses\n\nRussian forces had established a network of defensive positions and fortifications along the front lines, including minefields, trenches, and fortified bunkers. These defenses were designed to prevent Ukrainian advances and protect Russian-occupied territories.\n\n# Prelude\n\n## Planning\n\nUkrainian military planners had been preparing for a counteroffensive for several months, studying Russian defenses and identifying vulnerabilities. The operation was designed to exploit weaknesses in the Russian lines and create opportunities for breakthroughs.\n\n## Shaping operations\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the counteroffensive, Ukrainian forces conducted shaping operations to disrupt Russian command and control structures, damage supply lines, and weaken defensive positions. These operations included artillery strikes, drone attacks, and raids behind enemy lines.\n\n# Counteroffensive\n\n## Start date\n\nThe Ukrainian counteroffensive began on [insert date], with simultaneous attacks on multiple fronts.\n\n## Southern front\n\n### Melitopol direction\n\nUkrainian forces launched a major assault on the city of Melitopol, which had been under Russian control since the early days of the war. The attack aimed to break through Russian defenses and create a corridor to the Sea of Azov.\n\n### Berdiansk direction: Staromaiorske-Urozhaine\n\nIn a separate operation, Ukrainian forces targeted the Berdiansk direction, aiming to capture key terrain features and disrupt Russian supply lines. The fighting was intense, with both sides suffering heavy losses.\n\n## Eastern front\n\n### Donetsk Oblast\n\nUkrainian forces launched a series of attacks in the Donetsk Oblast, targeting Russian-held positions and attempting to break through defensive lines. The fighting was fierce, with both sides employing artillery and armor.\n\n## Dnieper front\n\nUkrainian forces also launched attacks along the Dnieper River, aiming to push Russian forces back and create a bridgehead for further advances.\n\n## Behind front lines\n\n### Crimea and the Black Sea\n\nUkrainian forces conducted a series of operations behind Russian lines, including in Crimea and the Black Sea region. These operations aimed to disrupt Russian command and control structures and create chaos.\n\n### Other areas\n\nUkrainian forces also launched attacks in other areas, including the Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia regions.\n\n## Result\n\nThe outcome of the counteroffensive is still unfolding, with fighting ongoing on multiple fronts. Ukrainian forces have made significant gains in some areas, while Russian forces have held their ground in others.\n\n# Strengths\n\n## Personnel\n\nUkrainian forces have benefited from significant training and equipment provided by Western countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. This has enabled them to develop a more professional and capable military.\n\n## Equipment\n\nUkrainian forces have received significant quantities of modern military equipment, including tanks, artillery, and anti-tank missiles. This has enabled them to match Russian forces in terms of firepower and mobility.\n\n# Casualties and losses\n\n## Ukraine\n\nUkrainian forces have suffered significant losses during the counteroffensive, including hundreds of killed and wounded soldiers.\n\n## Russia\n\nRussian forces have also suffered significant losses, including hundreds of killed and wounded soldiers, as well as significant equipment losses.\n\n# Analysis\n\n## Timeframe and progression\n\nThe counteroffensive is expected to be a long and bloody conflict, with both sides suffering significant losses. The outcome is uncertain, with much depending on the ability of Ukrainian forces to maintain momentum and exploit weaknesses in the Russian lines.\n\n## Significance and goals\n\nThe counteroffensive is significant because it marks a major shift in the conflict's dynamics, with Ukrainian forces taking the initiative and pushing Russian forces back. The goals of the operation are to liberate Ukrainian territory, disrupt Russian command and control structures, and create chaos behind enemy lines.\n\n### Concerns\n\nThere are concerns that the counteroffensive could lead to significant escalation, including the use of nuclear weapons or other forms of asymmetric warfare.\n\n## Tactics and equipment\n\n### Russian minefields and fortifications\n\nRussian forces have established extensive minefields and fortifications along the front lines, which have slowed Ukrainian advances.\n\n### Artillery and aerial warfare\n\nBoth sides have employed significant artillery and aerial firepower, including drones, aircraft, and helicopters.\n\n### Other tactics and equipment\n\nBoth sides have employed a range of tactics and equipment, including electronic warfare, cyber warfare, and special operations forces.\n\n## Russian command\n\n### Structure\n\nRussian command structures have been criticized for being slow and bureaucratic, which has hindered their ability to respond quickly to Ukrainian advances.\n\n### Issues\n\nThere are concerns that Russian forces are suffering from significant morale and discipline issues, which could impact their ability to fight effectively.\n\n# Early reactions\n\n## Governmental\n\nThe Ukrainian government has hailed the counteroffensive as a major success, with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy praising the bravery and resilience of Ukrainian forces.\n\n## Russian information space and milbloggers\n\nRussian milbloggers and media outlets have downplayed the significance of the counteroffensive, claiming that Ukrainian forces have suffered significant losses and that the operation is doomed to fail.\n\n# See also\n\n* 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* Ukrainian Armed Forces\n* Russian Armed Forces\n* War in Donbas\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is based on information available up to [insert date] and may not reflect subsequent developments.\n\n# References\n\nNone", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Ukrainian_counteroffensive\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##State of the war\n##Russian defenses\n#Prelude\n##Planning\n##Shaping operations\n#Counteroffensive\n##Start date\n##Southern front\n###Melitopol direction\n###Berdiansk direction: Staromaiorske-Urozhaine\n##Eastern front\n###Donetsk Oblast\n##Dnieper front\n##Behind front lines\n###Crimea and the Black Sea\n###Other areas\n##Result\n#Strengths\n##Personnel\n##Equipment\n#Casualties and losses\n##Ukraine\n##Russia\n#Analysis\n##Timeframe and progression\n##Significance and goals\n###Concerns\n##Tactics and equipment\n###Russian minefields and fortifications\n###Artillery and aerial warfare\n###Other tactics and equipment\n##Russian command\n###Structure\n###Issues\n#Early reactions\n##Governmental\n##Russian information space and milbloggers\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Bibliography\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The 11th named storm of the 2022 Pacific typhoon season, Hinnamnor brought widespread damage and disruption to the region.\n\n# Meteorological history\n\nTyphoon Hinnamnor originated from a tropical disturbance that formed to the east of the Philippines on August 26, 2022. The system slowly intensified as it moved northwestward, and on August 28, it developed into a tropical depression. Over the next few days, the depression continued to strengthen, and on August 30, it was upgraded to a tropical storm, receiving the name Hinnamnor.\n\nAs Hinnamnor moved further north, it encountered favorable environmental conditions, including low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures. The storm rapidly intensified, and on September 1, it reached typhoon strength. Over the next few days, Hinnamnor continued to strengthen, reaching its peak intensity on September 3, with maximum sustained winds of 250 km/h (155 mph) and a minimum central pressure of 920 hPa (27.17 inHg).\n\nAfter reaching its peak, Hinnamnor began to slowly weaken as it approached Japan and South Korea. The storm made landfall in Japan on September 6, and later in South Korea on September 7. After making landfall, Hinnamnor rapidly weakened, and on September 8, it was downgraded to a tropical depression.\n\n# Preparations\n\n## Japan\n\nAs Hinnamnor approached Japan, the government issued warnings and advisories for the residents of the affected areas. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) issued a Typhoon Warning for the southern island of Kyushu, as well as the western island of Honshu. The warning was later upgraded to a Typhoon Emergency Warning, indicating a high risk of severe damage.\n\nThe government also set up evacuation centers and shelters for residents who were ordered to evacuate. The Japanese military was put on standby to assist in rescue and relief efforts.\n\n## South Korea\n\nIn South Korea, the government issued a Typhoon Alert for the southern provinces of Jeju Island and South Gyeongsang Province. The Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) warned of strong winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surges.\n\nThe government also ordered the evacuation of residents in the affected areas, particularly those living in low-lying areas and coastal regions. The military was also put on standby to assist in rescue and relief efforts.\n\n## Elsewhere\n\nIn other countries, including Taiwan and the Philippines, the storm's outer rainbands brought heavy rainfall and strong winds. The governments of these countries issued warnings and advisories for the affected areas.\n\n# Impact\n\n## Japan\n\nTyphoon Hinnamnor made landfall in Japan on September 6, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall to the southern island of Kyushu. The storm caused widespread damage, including power outages, flooding, and landslides.\n\nAccording to reports, over 200,000 households lost power, and several highways and roads were closed due to flooding and landslides. The storm also caused significant damage to crops, particularly in the agricultural regions of Kyushu.\n\n## South Korea\n\nIn South Korea, the storm made landfall on September 7, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall to the southern provinces of Jeju Island and South Gyeongsang Province. The storm caused widespread damage, including power outages, flooding, and landslides.\n\nAccording to reports, over 100,000 households lost power, and several highways and roads were closed due to flooding and landslides. The storm also caused significant damage to crops, particularly in the agricultural regions of Jeju Island.\n\n## Elsewhere\n\nIn Taiwan, the storm's outer rainbands brought heavy rainfall and strong winds, causing power outages and flooding. In the Philippines, the storm's outer rainbands also brought heavy rainfall and strong winds, causing power outages and flooding.\n\n# Retirement\n\nAfter causing significant damage and disruption in Japan and South Korea, the name Hinnamnor was retired from the list of tropical cyclone names in the western Pacific. The name was replaced by a new name, which will be used for future tropical cyclones in the region.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of tropical cyclones\n* Pacific typhoon season\n* Typhoon Vongfong (2020)\n* Typhoon Haishen (2020)\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a factual summary of the events surrounding Typhoon Hinnamnor.

These midterm elections took place in the middle of President Joe Biden's term, with all 435 seats in the House of Representatives and approximately one-third of the seats in the Senate up for election. Additionally, numerous state and local elections were held, including gubernatorial elections in 36 states and four territories, as well as various state legislative and judicial elections.\n\n# Background\n\nThe 2022 elections were widely seen as a referendum on the presidency of Joe Biden and the Democratic Party's control of Congress. The elections also took place against the backdrop of various national and international issues, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, inflation, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n# Campaign\n\nThe campaign for the 2022 elections began in earnest in 2021, with numerous candidates announcing their intentions to run for office. The campaign was marked by intense partisanship and polarization, with both parties seeking to mobilize their bases and appeal to swing voters.\n\n## Primaries\n\nThe primary elections for the 2022 elections were held between March and September 2022. In many states, the primaries were fiercely contested, with candidates vying for the nomination of their respective parties. The primaries also saw the emergence of several high-profile candidates, including Republican candidates endorsed by former President Donald Trump.\n\n## Issues\n\nThe 2022 elections were dominated by a range of issues, including the economy, abortion, crime and gun violence, democracy, education, climate change, immigration, student loan forgiveness, and the presidency of Joe Biden.\n\n### Economy\n\nThe economy was a major issue in the 2022 elections, with many voters expressing concern about inflation, jobs, and economic growth.

The company has a rich history dating back to 1919 and has undergone significant transformations over the years. Today, Edwards Vacuum is a subsidiary of Atlas Copco, a Swedish industrial group.\n\n# History\n\n## Independent (1919-1967)\n\nEdwards Vacuum was founded in 1919 by F.D. Edwards in the United Kingdom. Initially, the company focused on producing vacuum pumps and gauges for the local market. During World War II, Edwards played a significant role in supplying vacuum equipment to the British war effort. In the post-war period, the company expanded its product range and began exporting to other countries.\n\n## BOC (1968-2006)\n\nIn 1968, Edwards Vacuum was acquired by the British Oxygen Company (BOC), a leading industrial gases group. Under BOC's ownership, Edwards continued to grow and expand its operations. The company invested heavily in research and development, leading to the introduction of new products and technologies. In the 1980s, Edwards became a leading supplier of vacuum equipment to the emerging semiconductor industry.\n\n## Linde and CCMP Capital (2006-2014)\n\nIn 2006, BOC was acquired by Linde AG, a German industrial gases group. As part of the deal, Edwards Vacuum was sold to CCMP Capital, a private equity firm. Under CCMP's ownership, Edwards continued to operate independently, focusing on its core business of vacuum equipment and abatement systems.\n\n## Atlas Copco (2014-present)\n\nIn 2014, Atlas Copco acquired Edwards Vacuum from CCMP Capital. The acquisition marked a significant milestone in Edwards' history, providing the company with access to new markets and resources. Today, Edwards operates as a subsidiary of Atlas Copco, continuing to develop and manufacture innovative vacuum and abatement solutions.\n\n# Products and markets\n\n## 1950-60s\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, Edwards focused on producing mechanical vacuum pumps and gauges. The company's products were used in a variety of applications, including laboratory research, industrial processes, and aerospace engineering.\n\n## 1970s\n\nIn the 1970s, Edwards began to develop and market new products, including rotary vane pumps and diffusion pumps. These products were designed for use in the emerging semiconductor industry, where high-vacuum conditions were required for the production of microchips.\n\n## 1980s\n\nThe 1980s saw significant growth in Edwards' business, driven by the expansion of the semiconductor industry. The company introduced new products, including magnetically levitated turbomolecular pumps and cryogenic pumps. These products were designed to meet the increasingly demanding requirements of the semiconductor industry.\n\n## 1990s\n\nIn the 1990s, Edwards continued to innovate and expand its product range. The company introduced new abatement systems, designed to safely dispose of hazardous gases and chemicals used in the semiconductor industry.\n\n## Recent\n\nToday, Edwards offers a wide range of vacuum and abatement solutions, including mechanical pumps, turbomolecular pumps, cryogenic pumps, and abatement systems. The company's products are used in a variety of applications, including semiconductor manufacturing, pharmaceutical production, and scientific research.\n\n# Edwards Lecture Series\n\nThe Edwards Lecture Series is an annual event that brings together leading experts in the field of vacuum science and technology. The series was established in 2015 to celebrate Edwards' 100th anniversary and has since become a major event in the vacuum industry. The lectures cover a range of topics, including vacuum technology, materials science, and surface engineering.\n\n# Controversies\n\n## Domain registration\n\nIn 2019, Edwards Vacuum was involved in a controversy surrounding the registration of the domain name \"edwards-vacuum.com\". The domain was registered by a third party, who used it to create a website that appeared to be affiliated with Edwards Vacuum. The company took action to resolve the issue, and the domain was eventually transferred to Edwards' ownership.\n\n## Hoffman Instrumentation Supply Inc\n\nIn 2018, Edwards Vacuum was sued by Hoffman Instrumentation Supply Inc, a US-based company that alleged that Edwards had infringed on its patent for a vacuum gauge. The case was settled out of court, with Edwards agreeing to pay a undisclosed sum to Hoffman.\n\n# References\n\n# External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Edwards_Vacuum\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Independent (1919-1967)\n##BOC (1968-2006)\n##Linde and CCMP Capital (2006-2014)\n##Atlas Copco (2014-present)\n#Products and markets\n##1950-60s\n##1970s\n##1980s\n##1990s\n##Recent\n#Edwards Lecture Series\n#Controversies\n##Domain registration\n##Hoffman Instrumentation Supply Inc\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He is considered one of the most important rulers of this period, and his reign is notable for its relative stability and prosperity.\n\nFamily\n--------\n\n### Parents and siblings\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I was the son of Pharaoh Pepi I and Queen Ankhesenpepi I. His mother was a daughter of Pharaoh Khui and Queen Neith, making Merenre a member of the royal family on both sides. He had several siblings, including his half-brother Pepi II, who would eventually succeed him as pharaoh.\n\n### Consorts and children\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I was married to Queen Ankhesenpepi II, who was also his half-sister. The couple had at least one son, Pepi II, who would go on to become one of the longest-reigning pharaohs in Egyptian history.\n\nReign\n------\n\n### Attestations\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's reign is well-attested through a variety of archaeological and textual evidence. His name appears on several monuments and artifacts, including his pyramid complex at Saqqara, as well as on the Palermo Stone and the Turin Papyrus.\n\n### Chronology\n\n#### Relative\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's reign is typically placed between that of his father, Pepi I, and his son, Pepi II. The exact length of his reign is not known, but it is believed to have been around 10-15 years.\n\n#### Absolute\n\nThe absolute dates for Merenre Nemtyemsaf I's reign are not certain, but based on radiocarbon dating and other methods, it is typically placed around 2287-2181 BC.\n\n### Duration\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's reign is often described as a period of relative stability and prosperity in ancient Egypt. The country was at peace, and the economy was thriving.\n\n### Accession to the throne: co-regency\n\nIt is believed that Merenre Nemtyemsaf I may have served as co-regent with his father, Pepi I, for a period of time before ascending to the throne in his own right. This would have allowed him to gain experience and prepare for his eventual role as pharaoh.\n\n### Domestic activities\n\n#### Administration\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's administrative reforms are not well-documented, but it is believed that he continued the policies of his father, Pepi I. The country was divided into several regions, each governed by a powerful noble.\n\n#### Cultic activities\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I was a devout follower of the traditional Egyptian gods, and his reign saw a resurgence in cultic activities. He built several temples and shrines, including a temple at Abydos dedicated to the god Osiris.\n\n#### Construction works\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's pyramid complex at Saqqara is one of the most impressive architectural achievements of the Old Kingdom period. The complex includes a main pyramid, a mortuary temple, and several smaller pyramids for the pharaoh's relatives.\n\n### End of reign\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's death is not well-documented, but it is believed that he died of natural causes after a relatively short reign. He was succeeded by his son, Pepi II, who would go on to become one of the longest-reigning pharaohs in Egyptian history.\n\nForeign activities\n-----------------\n\n### Eastern Desert and Levant\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's foreign policy is not well-documented, but it is believed that he maintained good relations with the neighboring countries of Nubia and the Levant. Egyptian trade and commerce flourished during this period.\n\n### Nubia\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's relations with Nubia are not well-documented, but it is believed that he maintained a strong military presence in the region. Egyptian control over Nubia was essential for the country's economy, as it provided access to valuable resources such as gold and ivory.\n\nPyramid complex\n----------------\n\n### Main pyramid\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's pyramid complex at Saqqara is one of the most impressive architectural achievements of the Old Kingdom period. The main pyramid is about 100 meters (330 feet) tall, making it one of the largest pyramids in Egypt.\n\n### Mortuary temple\n\nThe mortuary temple at Merenre Nemtyemsaf I's pyramid complex is one of the best-preserved examples of an Old Kingdom mortuary temple. The temple is decorated with reliefs depicting the pharaoh's daily life and his relationships with the gods.\n\n### Mummy\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's mummy has not been found, but it is believed that he was buried in his pyramid complex at Saqqara. The mummy of his mother, Queen Ankhesenpepi I, has been found, and it is now housed in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.\n\nLegacy\n--------\n\n### Old Kingdom\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's reign is often seen as a transitional period between the great pyramid-building era of the 4th and 5th dynasties and the decline of the Old Kingdom in the 7th and 8th dynasties. His pyramid complex at Saqqara is a testament to the enduring power and influence of the Old Kingdom pharaohs.\n\n### Later periods\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's legacy can be seen in the many later periods of Egyptian history. His pyramid complex at Saqqara was an inspiration to later pharaohs, including those of the New Kingdom period. The site was also an important center of worship and pilgrimage, and it continued to be used until the Roman period.\n\nNotes\n------\n\nReferences\n----------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Merenre_Nemtyemsaf_I\" following this outline:\n\n#Family\n##Parents and siblings\n##Consorts and children\n#Reign\n##Attestations\n##Chronology\n###Relative\n###Absolute\n##Duration\n##Accession to the throne: co-regency\n##Domestic activities\n###Administration\n###Cultic activities\n###Construction works\n##End of reign\n#Foreign activities\n##Eastern Desert and Levant\n##Nubia\n#Pyramid complex\n##Main pyramid\n##Mortuary temple\n##Mummy\n#Legacy\n##Old Kingdom\n##Later periods\n#Notes\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The film is based on the fairy tale of the same name by Charles Perrault and the Brothers Grimm. Sleeping Beauty is the 16th Disney animated feature film and was released to critical and commercial success.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe film tells the story of Princess Aurora, a beautiful and kind-hearted princess who is placed under a sleeping curse by the evil fairy Maleficent. The curse is cast after Aurora's parents, King Stefan and Queen Leah, fail to invite Maleficent to Aurora's christening. The curse is partially broken by the good fairy Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather, who weaken the curse to a sleeping spell that can be broken by true love's kiss.\n\nThe film follows Aurora as she grows up in the forest, unaware of her royal heritage, and falls in love with a prince named Philip. Meanwhile, Maleficent discovers that Aurora is still alive and seeks to kill her. The film culminates in a final battle between good and evil, with Philip and the three good fairies working to defeat Maleficent and break the curse.\n\n# Voice cast\n\nThe film features the voice talents of Mary Costa as Princess Aurora, Bill Shirley as Prince Philip, and Eleanor Audley as Maleficent. Verna Felton, Barbara Jo Allen, and Barbara Luderowski provide the voices of the three good fairies, Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather.\n\n# Production\n\n## Story development\n\nThe story of Sleeping Beauty was first developed in the 1930s, but production was delayed due to World War II. Walt Disney returned to the project in the 1950s, working with a team of writers and artists to develop the story and characters.\n\n## Casting\n\nThe voice cast was selected through a rigorous audition process, with Mary Costa being chosen for the role of Princess Aurora after a nationwide search. Bill Shirley was cast as Prince Philip, and Eleanor Audley was chosen for the role of Maleficent due to her distinctive voice.\n\n## Production delays\n\nProduction on Sleeping Beauty was delayed several times due to the complexity of the animation and the high standards set by Walt Disney. The film was originally scheduled for release in 1955, but was delayed until 1959.\n\n## Animation\n\n### Art direction\n\nThe film's art direction was led by Eyvind Earle, who developed the distinctive visual style of the film. Earle's use of bold lines and vibrant colors helped to create a unique and memorable look for the film.\n\n### Live-action reference\n\nThe film's animators used live-action reference footage to help create the characters' movements and interactions. This footage was shot with real actors, who were used as reference models for the animators.\n\n### Character animation\n\nThe character animation in Sleeping Beauty was led by a team of experienced animators, including Milt Kahl, Frank Thomas, and Ollie Johnston. The animators worked closely with the voice cast to develop the characters' personalities and mannerisms.\n\n## Music\n\nThe film's soundtrack was composed by George Bruns, with lyrics by Erdman Penner, Winston Hibler, and Walter Sheets. The soundtrack features a range of memorable songs, including \"Once Upon a Dream\" and \"I Wonder\".\n\n# Release\n\n## Original theatrical run\n\nSleeping Beauty was released to theaters on January 29, 1959. The film was a major success, grossing over $5 million at the box office.\n\n## Re-releases\n\nThe film has been re-released several times over the years, including in 1970, 1979, and 1986.\n\n## Home media\n\nSleeping Beauty was first released on home video in 1986, as part of the Walt Disney Classics series. The film has since been released on DVD, Blu-ray, and digital platforms.\n\n### Lawsuit\n\nIn 1993, a lawsuit was filed against Disney by a woman who claimed that the film's character of Maleficent was based on her own likeness. The lawsuit was ultimately dismissed.\n\n# Reception\n\n## Critical response\n\nSleeping Beauty received widespread critical acclaim upon its release. The film was praised for its stunning animation, memorable characters, and iconic soundtrack.\n\n## Accolades\n\nThe film was nominated for two Academy Awards, including Best Original Score and Best Original Song for \"Once Upon a Dream\".\n\n# Legacy\n\nSleeping Beauty has become a beloved classic, widely regarded as one of the greatest animated films of all time. The film's influence can be seen in a range of other animated films and TV shows, including Disney's own films and spin-offs.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of Disney animated feature films\n* List of Disney princesses\n* List of films based on fairy tales\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is based on the 1959 film Sleeping Beauty, and does not include information on other adaptations or interpretations of the story.\n\n# References\n\nThis article does not include any citations or references.\n\n# Bibliography\n\n* Barrier, J.M.

Free\n================\n\nKarl R. Free was an American artist, best known for his work on post office murals during the 1930s. His artwork often depicted scenes of everyday life, exploring themes of community, social justice, and the human condition. This article provides an overview of Free's life, career, and notable works.\n\nEarly Years\n------------\n\nKarl R. Free was born in 1903 in the United States. Little is known about his early life, but it is believed that he developed an interest in art at a young age. Free went on to study art at various institutions, honing his skills and developing his unique style. His early work was largely influenced by the social realism movement, which emphasized the depiction of everyday life and the struggles of the working class.\n\nWhitney Museum Assistant Curator\n---------------------------------\n\nBefore becoming a prominent artist, Free worked as an assistant curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City. During his time at the museum, he was exposed to a wide range of American art, including works by artists such as Edward Hopper and Thomas Hart Benton. This experience likely had a significant impact on Free's artistic development, as he was able to study and learn from the works of other prominent American artists.\n\nPost Office Murals\n-------------------\n\nFree is perhaps best known for his work on post office murals during the 1930s. As part of the New Deal's Federal Art Project, Free was commissioned to create murals for post offices in Washington, D.C. and Princeton, New Jersey. These murals were designed to promote social justice, community, and the values of the working class.\n\n### Washington, D.C.\n\n#### Creation\n\nFree's mural for the Washington, D.C. post office, titled \"The New Deal,\" was completed in 1935. The mural depicted a scene of everyday life in the city, with workers, farmers, and families going about their daily business. The mural also included images of prominent figures from American history, including George Washington and Abraham Lincoln.\n\n#### Reception and Objections\n\n\"The New Deal\" was met with both praise and criticism upon its completion. Some viewers saw the mural as a powerful representation of American values and the struggles of the working class. Others, however, objected to the mural's depiction of African Americans, which some saw as stereotypical and demeaning. Despite these objections, the mural remains an important work in Free's oeuvre.\n\n### Princeton, New Jersey\n\n#### Creation\n\nFree's mural for the Princeton, New Jersey post office, titled \"The Colonial Past,\" was completed in 1936. The mural depicted a scene of colonial-era Princeton, with settlers, farmers, and Native Americans interacting in a peaceful and idyllic setting.\n\n#### Reception and Objections\n\n\"The Colonial Past\" was also met with both praise and criticism upon its completion. Some viewers saw the mural as a nostalgic and romanticized depiction of America's colonial past. Others, however, objected to the mural's depiction of Native Americans, which some saw as inaccurate and stereotypical. Despite these objections, the mural remains an important work in Free's oeuvre.\n\n1939 and Beyond\n----------------\n\nFree's work on post office murals during the 1930s marked the height of his career as an artist. After the completion of his Princeton mural, Free continued to work on various artistic projects, but he never again achieved the same level of recognition or acclaim. Despite this, Free's work remains an important part of American art history, and his post office murals continue to be celebrated for their beauty, power, and historical significance.\n\nSee Also\n--------\n\n* New Deal\n* Federal Art Project\n* Post office murals\n* Social realism\n\nNotes\n------\n\nThis article is based on available information about Karl R.

The incident occurred in July 1947, when a strange object crashed on a ranch near Roswell, New Mexico. The US military initially reported that they had recovered a \"flying disc,\" but later claimed it was a weather balloon that had been found. Over the years, numerous conspiracy theories have emerged, suggesting that the military had actually recovered an extraterrestrial spacecraft and had been covering it up. This article will explore the history of the Roswell incident, the various conspiracy theories that have emerged, and the explanations that have been proposed.\n\n# 1947 Military Balloon Crash\n\nOn July 8, 1947, a strange object crashed on a ranch near Roswell, New Mexico. The rancher, W.W. Brazel, discovered the debris and reported it to the local sheriff, who in turn notified the military. The US Army Air Forces (USAAF) issued a press release announcing the recovery of a \"flying disc,\" which was picked up by the local newspaper, the Roswell Daily Record. The story caused a sensation, with many people believing that the military had actually recovered an extraterrestrial spacecraft.\n\nHowever, the military soon retracted their statement, saying that the object was actually a weather balloon that had been found. The USAAF released a second press release, stating that the object was a \"high-altitude weather balloon\" that had been launched from a nearby base. The military also produced a photograph of the debris, which showed a collection of materials, including aluminum foil, plastic, and rubber.\n\n# UFO Conspiracy Theories (1947–1978)\n\nDespite the military's attempts to downplay the incident, many people continued to believe that the USAAF had actually recovered an extraterrestrial spacecraft. Over the years, numerous UFO conspiracy theories emerged, suggesting that the military had been covering up the truth about the Roswell incident.\n\n## Aztec Crashed Saucer Hoax\n\nIn 1948, a man named Silas M. Newton claimed that he had recovered a crashed saucer from a site in Aztec, New Mexico. Newton's story was widely publicized, and many people believed that he had actually recovered an extraterrestrial spacecraft. However, it was later revealed that Newton's story was a hoax, and that he had fabricated the entire incident.\n\n## Hangar 18\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, a conspiracy theory emerged suggesting that the US military had recovered an extraterrestrial spacecraft and was storing it in a secret hangar at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio. The hangar was referred to as \"Hangar 18,\" and many people believed that it was the location where the military was hiding the truth about the Roswell incident.\n\n# Roswell Conspiracy Theories (1978–1994)\n\nIn 1978, a man named Stanton Friedman published a book called \"Crash at Corona,\" which suggested that the US military had actually recovered an extraterrestrial spacecraft from the Roswell incident. Friedman's book sparked a renewed interest in the Roswell incident, and numerous conspiracy theories emerged over the next several years.\n\n## The Roswell Incident\n\nIn 1980, a book called \"The Roswell Incident\" was published, which claimed that the US military had recovered an extraterrestrial spacecraft and had been covering it up for over 30 years. The book was written by Charles Berlitz and William L. Moore, and it became a bestseller.\n\n## Majestic 12 Hoax\n\nIn 1980, a set of documents was released, which claimed to be a top-secret government report on the Roswell incident. The documents were referred to as \"Majestic 12,\" and they suggested that the US military had recovered an extraterrestrial spacecraft and had been studying it for over 30 years. However, it was later revealed that the documents were a hoax, and that they had been fabricated by a man named Richard Doty.\n\n## Role of Glenn Dennis\n\nIn the 1980s, a man named Glenn Dennis came forward, claiming that he had been a mortician at the Roswell Army Air Field in 1947, and that he had been called upon to prepare the bodies of aliens who had been recovered from the crash.

It is a framework for doing mathematics that is based on constructive principles, which means that it avoids the use of classical logic and instead relies on intuitionistic logic. In this article, we will provide an overview of constructive set theory, its history, and its main features.\n\n# Introduction\n\nConstructive set theory is a relatively new field that emerged in the mid-20th century as a response to the criticisms of classical set theory. The main goal of constructive set theory is to provide a foundation for mathematics that is based on constructive principles, which means that it avoids the use of classical logic and instead relies on intuitionistic logic.\n\n## Constructive Outlook\n\n### Preliminary on the use of intuitionistic logic\n\nIntuitionistic logic is a branch of logic that was developed by L.E.J. Brouwer in the early 20th century. It is based on the idea that mathematical statements are not just true or false, but also have a constructive meaning. In intuitionistic logic, a statement is considered to be true only if it can be proved constructively, which means that it can be proved using a finite number of steps.\n\n### Imposed restrictions on a set theory\n\nConstructive set theory imposes several restrictions on the use of classical set theory. For example, it does not allow the use of the law of excluded middle, which states that a statement is either true or false. Instead, constructive set theory relies on the principle of excluded middle, which states that a statement is either true or not true.\n\n### Metalogic\n\nConstructive set theory also has a metalogic that is different from classical set theory. In constructive set theory, the metalogic is based on intuitionistic logic, which means that it does not allow the use of classical logic.\n\n### Anti-classical principles\n\nConstructive set theory also has several anti-classical principles, which means that it rejects several principles of classical set theory. For example, it rejects the axiom of choice, which states that for any set of sets, there is a function that chooses an element from each set.\n\n## History and Overview\n\nConstructive set theory has a relatively short history that dates back to the mid-20th century. It emerged as a response to the criticisms of classical set theory and has since become a major area of research in mathematics.\n\n### Models\n\nConstructive set theory has several models, which are used to interpret the theory. The most common model is the model of constructive sets, which is used to interpret the theory of constructive sets.\n\n# Notation\n\nConstructive set theory uses a notation that is similar to classical set theory.

The equipment is designed to absorb the forces generated by a falling climber, and to provide a secure attachment to the rock or other climbing protection. The use of climbing equipment is essential for safe climbing practices, and climbers should be familiar with the proper use and maintenance of their gear.\n\nUse and certification\n---------------------\n\n### Type of climbing\n\nThe type of climbing being undertaken will determine the type and amount of equipment required. For example, sport climbing typically requires less equipment than traditional climbing, as the protection is already in place in the form of bolts. Ice climbing, on the other hand, requires specialized equipment such as crampons and ice axes.\n\n### Certification\n\nMany climbing organizations offer certification programs for climbers, which cover topics such as equipment usage, safety protocols, and climbing techniques. These programs are designed to ensure that climbers have the necessary knowledge and skills to use their equipment safely and effectively.\n\nRopes and slings\n-----------------\n\n### Ropes\n\nClimbing ropes are designed to absorb the forces generated by a falling climber. They are typically made of nylon or other durable materials, and are available in a range of lengths and diameters. Ropes can be classified into several types, including:\n\n* Single ropes: These are the most common type of rope, and are designed for general climbing use.\n* Half ropes: These are thinner and lighter than single ropes, and are often used for climbing routes that require a lot of protection.\n* Twin ropes: These are used for climbing routes that require an extra margin of safety, such as ice climbing or big wall climbing.\n\n### Slings\n\nSlings are lengths of webbing or cord that are used to connect the rope to the climber's harness or to protection. They can be made of nylon or other materials, and are available in a range of lengths and widths.\n\n### Cords\n\nCords are thin, lightweight ropes that are used for a variety of applications, such as creating anchors or connecting quickdraws to the rope.\n\nRope connectors\n----------------\n\n### Carabiners\n\nCarabiners are metal clips that are used to connect the rope to protection or to the climber's harness. They are typically made of aluminum or steel, and are available in a range of shapes and sizes.\n\n### Harnesses\n\nHarnesses are worn by the climber to attach the rope to their body. They typically consist of a waist belt and leg loops, and may also include additional features such as gear loops and a belay loop.\n\n### Lanyards\n\nLanyards are lengths of webbing or cord that are used to connect the climber's harness to protection or to the rope. They can be made of nylon or other materials, and are available in a range of lengths and widths.\n\n#### Personal anchor systems\n\nPersonal anchor systems (PAS) are used to create a secure attachment between the climber and the rope. They typically consist of a lanyard and a carabiner, and may also include additional features such as a shock absorber.\n\n### Quickdraws\n\nQuickdraws are used to connect the rope to bolts or other protection. They typically consist of a carabiner and a sling, and may also include additional features such as a quick-release mechanism.\n\nRope devices\n-------------\n\n### Ascenders\n\nAscenders are mechanical devices that are used to climb a rope. They are typically used for big wall climbing or rescue applications.\n\n### Belay devices\n\nBelay devices are used to control the rope during climbing and descending. They are typically made of metal or plastic, and are available in a range of shapes and sizes.\n\n### Descenders\n\nDescenders are mechanical devices that are used to control the rate of descent during rappelling. They are typically made of metal or plastic, and are available in a range of shapes and sizes.\n\n### Self-locking devices\n\nSelf-locking devices are used to create a secure attachment between the rope and the climber's harness. They are typically used for rescue applications or for climbing routes that require an extra margin of safety.\n\nProtection devices\n-----------------\n\n### Temporary\n\nTemporary protection devices are used to create a secure attachment to the rock or other climbing surface. They can be classified into two types:\n\n#### Active\n\nActive protection devices are designed to absorb the forces generated by a falling climber. They include devices such as cams and nuts.\n\n#### Passive\n\nPassive protection devices are designed to provide a secure attachment to the rock or other climbing surface. They include devices such as hexes and pitons.\n\n### Fixed\n\nFixed protection devices are permanently attached to the rock or other climbing surface. They include devices such as bolts and anchors.\n\nAid equipment\n-------------\n\nAid equipment is used to assist the climber in ascending the rock or other climbing surface. It can include devices such as ladders, ascenders, and aiders.\n\nClothing equipment\n-----------------\n\nClothing equipment is designed to provide comfort and protection for the climber. It can include items such as climbing shoes, gloves, and hats.\n\nMiscellaneous equipment\n----------------------\n\nMiscellaneous equipment includes a range of items that are used to support the climbing process. It can include items such as first aid kits, headlamps, and climbing journals.\n\nTraining equipment\n-----------------\n\nTraining equipment is used to practice and improve climbing skills. It can include items such as hangboards, campus boards, and climbing walls.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n### Manufacturers\n\n* Arc'teryx\n* Black Diamond\n* Camp USA\n* Edelrid\n* Grivel\n* Petzl\n\n### Types\n\n* Alpine climbing\n* Bouldering\n* Ice climbing\n* Rock climbing\n* Sport climbing\n* Traditional climbing\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n* \"Climbing Equipment\" by the International Federation of Mountain Guides Associations\n* \"Rock Climbing Equipment\" by the American Mountain Guides Association\n* \"Climbing Protection\" by the UIAA\n\nFurther reading\n---------------\n\n* \"The Self-Coached Climber\" by Dan Hague and Douglas Hunter\n* \"Climbing: From Gym to Rock\" by Jonathon Thesenga\n* \"Rock Climbing: The Complete Guide\" by John Long\n\nExternal links\n---------------\n\n* American Mountain Guides Association\n* International Federation of Mountain Guides Associations\n* UIAA\n* Climbing.com", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Rock-climbing_equipment\" following this outline:\n\n#Use and certification\n##Type of climbing\n##Certification\n#Ropes and slings\n##Ropes\n##Slings\n##Cords\n#Rope connectors\n##Carabiners\n##Harnesses\n##Lanyards\n###Personal anchor systems\n##Quickdraws\n#Rope devices\n##Ascenders\n##Belay devices\n##Descenders\n##Self-locking devices\n#Protection devices\n##Temporary\n###Active\n###Passive\n##Fixed\n#Aid equipment\n#Clothing equipment\n#Miscellaneous equipment\n#Training equipment\n#See also\n##Manufacturers\n##Types\n#References\n##Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The protest, which began in late January 2023, drew widespread attention and sparked a significant response from the government, sports authorities, and the international community.\n\nBackground\n\nThe Indian wrestling community has long been plagued by allegations of corruption, nepotism, and mismanagement within the WFI. However, the spark that ignited the 2023 protest was the alleged sexual harassment of several female wrestlers by WFI president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh. The allegations, which surfaced in January 2023, were made by several prominent female wrestlers, including Olympic medalists and national champions.\n\nInitial Investigation\n\nFollowing the allegations, the WFI initiated an internal investigation, which was widely criticized as inadequate and biased. The investigation, led by a committee comprising WFI officials, was seen as an attempt to whitewash the allegations and protect the federation's president. The wrestlers, who had been demanding an independent and impartial investigation, grew increasingly frustrated with the WFI's handling of the matter.\n\nProtest Overview\n\nThe protest began on January 18, 2023, when a group of wrestlers, led by Olympic medalist Bajrang Punia, gathered at the Jantar Mantar in New Delhi to demand justice and accountability from the WFI. The protest quickly gained momentum, with wrestlers from across the country joining in solidarity.\n\n## FIR Registration and Supreme Court Intervention\n\nOn January 20, 2023, the wrestlers filed a First Information Report (FIR) with the Delhi Police, alleging sexual harassment and corruption against Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh. The FIR was registered under sections 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code. The Supreme Court of India took suo moto cognizance of the matter and directed the Delhi Police to investigate the allegations.\n\n## Jantar Mantar Clash\n\nOn January 22, 2023, a clash broke out between the protesting wrestlers and the police at the Jantar Mantar. The wrestlers, who had been demanding an audience with the Prime Minister, were met with resistance from the police, who attempted to disperse the crowd. Several wrestlers were injured in the clash, and many were detained by the police.\n\n## Formation of SIT and Questioning of Witnesses\n\nFollowing the Supreme Court's intervention, a Special Investigation Team (SIT) was formed to investigate the allegations against Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh. The SIT, comprising senior police officials, began questioning witnesses and gathering evidence. The wrestlers, who had been demanding an independent investigation, welcomed the SIT's formation and cooperated fully with the inquiry.\n\n## New Parliament House March and Detainment\n\nOn January 25, 2023, the wrestlers marched towards the New Parliament House, demanding an audience with the Prime Minister and the Sports Minister. However, they were met with resistance from the police, who detained several wrestlers, including Bajrang Punia and Olympic medalist Sakshi Malik.\n\n## Meeting with Sports Minister and Filing Chargesheet\n\nOn January 28, 2023, the wrestlers met with the Sports Minister, Anurag Thakur, who assured them of a fair and impartial investigation. The SIT, which had been investigating the allegations, filed a chargesheet against Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, alleging sexual harassment and corruption.\n\nAftermath\n\nThe 2023 Indian wrestlers' protest had a significant impact on the sports community and the government. The protest led to the resignation of Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh as WFI president and the formation of an ad-hoc committee to manage the affairs of the federation. The government also announced several measures to ensure the safety and well-being of athletes, including the establishment of a national helpline for reporting sexual harassment.\n\nReactions\n\n## Domestic\n\nThe protest received widespread support from the Indian public, with many condemning the alleged sexual harassment and corruption within the WFI. However, some sections of the media and the public criticized the wrestlers for taking to the streets and demanding justice.\n\n### Criticism\n\nSome critics argued that the wrestlers should have followed the established procedures for reporting sexual harassment and corruption, rather than taking to the streets. Others argued that the protest was politically motivated and that the wrestlers were being used as pawns by opposition parties.\n\n## International\n\nThe protest received significant attention from the international community, with several organizations and individuals expressing solidarity with the wrestlers.\n\n### United World Wrestling\n\nThe United World Wrestling (UWW), the international governing body for wrestling, expressed concern over the allegations of sexual harassment and corruption within the WFI. The UWW offered support to the wrestlers and called for a thorough investigation into the allegations.\n\n### International Olympic Committee\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) also expressed concern over the allegations and called for a thorough investigation. The IOC offered support to the wrestlers and reiterated its commitment to ensuring the safety and well-being of athletes.\n\n### Parliamentarians\n\nSeveral parliamentarians from around the world expressed solidarity with the wrestlers and called for action against the alleged perpetrators. The parliamentarians also called for greater accountability and transparency within sports organizations.\n\nMedia Coverage\n\nThe protest received extensive media coverage, with several national and international news outlets reporting on the story.

It is a common and usually harmless condition, but can be distressing for parents and caregivers. Febrile seizures are also known as febrile convulsions or febrile fits.\n\n# Signs and Symptoms\n\nThe symptoms of a febrile seizure can vary, but typically include:\n\n* A sudden loss of consciousness and muscle tone, often accompanied by a fever\n* Convulsions or shaking of the body, which can be generalized (affecting the entire body) or focal (affecting one part of the body)\n* Changes in breathing patterns, including rapid or shallow breathing\n* Possible loss of bladder or bowel control\n* Possible tongue biting or injury to the mouth\n* Post-seizure confusion, lethargy, or sleepiness\n\n## Types\n\nThere are two main types of febrile seizures:\n\n* Simple febrile seizure: This is the most common type, accounting for about 80% of cases. It is characterized by a single seizure lasting less than 15 minutes, with no focal features and no recurrence within 24 hours.\n* Complex febrile seizure: This type is less common, but more concerning. It is characterized by a seizure that lasts longer than 15 minutes, has focal features, or recurs within 24 hours.\n\n# Causes\n\nThe exact cause of febrile seizures is not fully understood, but several factors are thought to contribute:\n\n* Fever: A rapid rise in body temperature can trigger a febrile seizure. The most common causes of fever in children are viral infections, such as the flu or a cold.\n* Genetics: Some families may be more prone to febrile seizures due to genetic factors.\n* Developmental stage: Children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years are more susceptible to febrile seizures due to the immaturity of their brains.\n* Brain chemistry: Imbalances in neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and GABA, may contribute to the development of febrile seizures.\n\n# Mechanism\n\nThe mechanism of febrile seizures is not fully understood, but is thought to involve:\n\n* Abnormal electrical activity in the brain: This can be triggered by a rapid rise in body temperature, which can alter the functioning of neurons and lead to a seizure.\n* Involvement of neurotransmitters: Imbalances in neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and GABA, may contribute to the development of febrile seizures.\n* Immaturity of the brain: Children's brains are still developing, and may be more susceptible to abnormal electrical activity and seizures.\n\n# Diagnosis\n\nDiagnosing a febrile seizure can be challenging, as the symptoms can be similar to those of other conditions, such as epilepsy. A diagnosis is typically made based on:\n\n* Medical history: A thorough medical history, including information about the child's fever, seizure activity, and any previous seizures.\n* Physical examination: A physical examination to rule out other conditions that may be causing the symptoms.\n* Laboratory tests: Laboratory tests, such as blood tests and imaging studies, may be ordered to rule out other conditions and to check for any underlying infections.\n\n# Prevention\n\nThere is no surefire way to prevent febrile seizures, but some measures can help reduce the risk:\n\n* Reducing fever: Using medications, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, to reduce fever can help reduce the risk of a febrile seizure.\n* Improving air quality: Keeping the air clean and free of pollutants can help reduce the risk of respiratory infections, which can trigger febrile seizures.\n* Practicing good hygiene: Practicing good hygiene, such as washing hands regularly and avoiding close contact with people who are sick, can help reduce the risk of infections.\n\n# Treatment\n\nThe treatment of febrile seizures typically involves:\n\n* Reducing fever: Using medications, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, to reduce fever.\n* Supporting the child: Providing supportive care, such as ensuring the child is safe and comfortable, and monitoring their condition.\n* Anticonvulsant medication: In some cases, anticonvulsant medication may be prescribed to help prevent future seizures.\n* Hospitalization: In severe cases, hospitalization may be necessary to monitor the child's condition and provide supportive care.\n\n# Prognosis\n\nThe prognosis for children with febrile seizures is generally good. Most children outgrow febrile seizures by the time they are 5 years old, and the risk of developing epilepsy is low. However, some children may be at higher risk of developing epilepsy or other neurological conditions.\n\n# Epidemiology\n\nFebrile seizures are common, affecting about 4% of children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years. They are more common in boys than girls, and in children with a family history of febrile seizures. The peak age for febrile seizures is around 18 months.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Febrile_seizure\" following this outline:\n\n#Signs and symptoms\n##Types\n#Causes\n#Mechanism\n#Diagnosis\n#Prevention\n#Treatment\n#Prognosis\n#Epidemiology\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
