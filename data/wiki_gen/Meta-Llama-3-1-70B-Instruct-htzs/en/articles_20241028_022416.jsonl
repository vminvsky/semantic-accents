These mid-term elections were seen as a critical test of the presidency of Joe Biden and the direction of the country.\n\n# Background\n\nThe 2022 elections took place during a period of significant polarization and division in the United States. The COVID-19 pandemic had caused widespread disruption and economic hardship, and the country was still grappling with the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election. The elections were also influenced by the ongoing controversy over abortion rights, gun violence, and climate change.\n\n# Campaign\n\nThe 2022 campaign season was marked by intense competition and record-breaking spending. Candidates from both parties focused on key issues such as the economy, abortion, and crime, and sought to mobilize their bases and appeal to swing voters.\n\n## Primaries\n\nThe primary season began in March 2022 and lasted for several months. Many incumbent members of Congress and governors faced challenges from within their own parties, while others retired or declined to run for re-election. The primaries saw the emergence of several high-profile candidates, including newcomers and established politicians.\n\n## Issues\n\n### Economy\n\nThe economy was a major issue in the 2022 elections, with candidates debating the best ways to promote growth, reduce inflation, and address income inequality. Democrats emphasized the need for government investment in infrastructure and social programs, while Republicans called for tax cuts and deregulation.\n\n### Abortion\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v.

The couple had at least one son, who is thought to have died in infancy. There is also evidence of a possible co-regency between Merenre and his son, but the details are unclear.\n\nReign\n------\n\n### Attestations\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I is well attested in contemporary sources, including several papyri, reliefs, and architectural remains.

This co-regency would have helped to ensure a smooth transition of power.\n\n### Domestic Activities\n\n#### Administration\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I continued the administrative reforms begun by his father, including the reorganization of the Egyptian bureaucracy and the establishment of a more efficient system of taxation.\n\n#### Cultic Activities\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I was deeply involved in the cult of the ancient Egyptian gods, and his reign saw a renewed focus on the worship of the sun god, Ra. He also oversaw the construction of several temples and shrines throughout Egypt.\n\n#### Construction Works\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I was a prolific builder, and his reign saw the construction of several major projects, including his mortuary complex at Saqqara, which is one of the best-preserved pyramid complexes in Egypt.\n\n### End of Reign\n\nThe circumstances of Merenre Nemtyemsaf I's death are not known, but it is believed he died of natural causes around 2250 BC. He was succeeded by his brother, Pepi II.\n\nForeign Activities\n-----------------\n\n### Eastern Desert and Levant\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I oversaw several military campaigns in the Eastern Desert and the Levant, including a major expedition to Nubia. These campaigns helped to secure Egypt's borders and establish trade relationships with neighboring regions.\n\n### Nubia\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's military campaigns in Nubia were particularly successful, and he was able to establish several Egyptian fortresses and trading posts in the region.\n\nPyramid Complex\n----------------\n\n### Main Pyramid\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's main pyramid is located at Saqqara, and is one of the best-preserved pyramid complexes in Egypt. The pyramid is around 52 meters high and has a base perimeter of around 240 meters.\n\n### Mortuary Temple\n\nThe mortuary temple of Merenre Nemtyemsaf I is located near his pyramid and is one of the best-preserved temples of the Old Kingdom. The temple features several reliefs and statues of the pharaoh and other gods.\n\n### Mummy\n\nUnfortunately, the mummy of Merenre Nemtyemsaf I has not been found, and it is believed that his tomb was robbed in ancient times.\n\nLegacy\n--------\n\n### Old Kingdom\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's reign marked the beginning of the end of the Old Kingdom, which would eventually collapse under the weight of internal power struggles and external pressures.\n\n### Later Periods\n\nDespite the decline of the Old Kingdom, Merenre Nemtyemsaf I's legacy continued to be felt in later periods of ancient Egyptian history. His building projects and military campaigns helped to establish Egypt as a major power in the ancient Near East.\n\nNotes\n------\n\nThis article is a general overview of Merenre Nemtyemsaf I's life and reign, and is based on available historical sources.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Merenre_Nemtyemsaf_I\" following this outline:\n\n#Family\n##Parents and siblings\n##Consorts and children\n#Reign\n##Attestations\n##Chronology\n###Relative\n###Absolute\n##Duration\n##Accession to the throne: co-regency\n##Domestic activities\n###Administration\n###Cultic activities\n###Construction works\n##End of reign\n#Foreign activities\n##Eastern Desert and Levant\n##Nubia\n#Pyramid complex\n##Main pyramid\n##Mortuary temple\n##Mummy\n#Legacy\n##Old Kingdom\n##Later periods\n#Notes\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The film tells the story of Princess Aurora, a beautiful and kind-hearted princess who is placed under a sleeping curse by the evil fairy Maleficent. With the help of a group of good fairies and a brave prince, Aurora must be awakened from her eternal slumber and defeat the forces of evil.\n\n#Plot\n\nThe film begins with the birth of Princess Aurora, the daughter of King Stefan and Queen Leah. The entire kingdom is invited to the celebration of Aurora's birth, except for the evil fairy Maleficent, who is angry at not being invited. Maleficent curses the princess, declaring that on her 16th birthday, Aurora will prick her finger on a spinning wheel and fall into a deep sleep, never to awaken. The good fairies, Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather, try to weaken the curse by declaring that instead of dying, Aurora will fall into a deep sleep that can only be broken by the kiss of true love.\n\nThe film then jumps forward to Aurora's 16th birthday, where she meets Prince Philip, a handsome and charming prince who has fallen in love with her. However, their love is put to the test when Maleficent disguises herself as an old hag and tricks Aurora into pricking her finger on a spinning wheel. The curse is fulfilled, and Aurora falls into a deep sleep.\n\nThe good fairies try to stop Maleficent, but she is too powerful. They decide to put the entire kingdom to sleep, hoping that when Aurora awakens, the kingdom will also awaken. Prince Philip battles Maleficent and her minions, but he is captured and imprisoned. The good fairies help Philip escape, and he makes his way to the sleeping Aurora. He kisses her, breaking the curse, and Aurora awakens.\n\nThe film ends with the wedding of Aurora and Philip, surrounded by their friends and family. Maleficent is punished for her evil deeds, and the kingdom celebrates the happiness of the young couple.\n\n#Voice cast\n\n* Mary Costa as Princess Aurora/Briar Rose\n* Bill Shirley as Prince Philip\n* Eleanor Audley as Maleficent\n* Verna Felton as Flora\n* Barbara Jo Allen as Fauna\n* Barbara Luderowski as Merryweather\n* Taylor Holmes as King Stefan\n* Bill Thompson as King Hubert\n* Candy Candido as Maleficent's goon\n* Pinto Colvig as Maleficent's goon\n* Bob Amsberry as Maleficent's goon\n\n#Production\n\n##Story development\n\nWalt Disney had been interested in adapting \"Sleeping Beauty\" into an animated film since the 1930s. However, the project was put on hold due to World War II and the failure of Pinocchio. In the 1950s, Disney revived the project, and a team of writers and artists began working on the story.\n\nThe original fairy tale by Charles Perrault and the Brothers Grimm was quite dark, and Disney wanted to make the story more suitable for children. The writers added new characters, such as the good fairies and Prince Philip, to make the story more appealing to children.\n\n##Casting\n\nThe voice cast for the film was carefully selected. Mary Costa, a young singer, was chosen to play the role of Princess Aurora. Bill Shirley, a Broadway actor, was chosen to play the role of Prince Philip. Eleanor Audley, a veteran voice actress, was chosen to play the role of Maleficent.\n\n##Production delays\n\nThe production of Sleeping Beauty was plagued by delays. The film was originally scheduled for release in 1955, but it was pushed back to 1957, and finally to 1959. The delays were due to the complexity of the animation and the need for perfection.\n\n##Animation\n\n###Art direction\n\nThe art direction for the film was led by Eyvind Earle, a renowned artist and designer. Earle was responsible for creating the look and feel of the film, including the characters, settings, and special effects. He was inspired by medieval art and architecture, and he created a unique and distinctive style for the film.\n\n###Live-action reference\n\nTo create realistic animation, the animators used live-action reference. Actors were filmed performing the scenes, and the animators used the footage as a reference point. This technique helped to create a more realistic and believable animation.\n\n###Character animation\n\nThe character animation for the film was led by a team of experienced animators, including Milt Kahl, Frank Thomas, and Ollie Johnston. The animators used a combination of traditional animation techniques and new technologies, such as the Multiplane camera, to create complex and detailed animation.\n\n##Music\n\nThe music for the film was composed by George Bruns, with lyrics by Erdman Penner, Winston Hibler, and Walter Sheets. The film's iconic score includes the songs \"Once Upon a Dream,\" \"I Wonder,\" and \"Sleeping Beauty Waltz.\" The music was performed by the Disney Studio Orchestra, with vocals by Mary Costa and Bill Shirley.\n\n#Release\n\n##Original theatrical run\n\nSleeping Beauty was released on January 29, 1959, at the Radio City Music Hall in New York City. The film was a critical and commercial success, and it became one of the highest-grossing films of the year.\n\n##Re-releases\n\nThe film was re-released in 1970, 1979, 1986, and 1995. Each re-release was successful, and the film continued to be a beloved classic.\n\n##Home media\n\nSleeping Beauty was first released on home video in 1986, on VHS and LaserDisc. The film was later released on DVD in 1997, and on Blu-ray in 2008. The film's 50th anniversary edition was released in 2008, featuring a restored and remastered version of the film.\n\n###Lawsuit\n\nIn 1997, a lawsuit was filed against Disney by a group of artists who claimed that they had been denied royalties for their work on the film. The lawsuit was settled out of court, with Disney agreeing to pay the artists a percentage of the film's profits.\n\n#Reception\n\n##Critical response\n\nSleeping Beauty received widespread critical acclaim upon its release. The film's animation, music, and storytelling were praised by critics, and it became one of the highest-rated films of the year.\n\n##Accolades\n\nThe film won several awards, including the Academy Award for Best Original Score. The film was also nominated for Best Original Song for \"Once Upon a Dream.\"\n\n#Legacy\n\nSleeping Beauty has become a beloved classic, and its influence can be seen in many other films and TV shows. The film's iconic characters, such as Maleficent and Prince Philip, have become cultural icons. The film's music, particularly \"Once Upon a Dream,\" has become a timeless classic.\n\n#See also\n\n* List of Disney animated films\n* List of highest-grossing films\n* List of Academy Award winners\n\n#Notes\n\n* This article is based on the 1959 animated film Sleeping Beauty, and not on the original fairy tale or any other adaptations.\n\n#References\n\n* (No references cited)\n\n#Bibliography\n\n* (No bibliography cited)\n\n#External links\n\n* (No external links cited)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Sleeping_Beauty_(1959_film)\" following this outline:\n\n#Plot\n#Voice cast\n#Production\n##Story development\n##Casting\n##Production delays\n##Animation\n###Art direction\n###Live-action reference\n###Character animation\n##Music\n#Release\n##Original theatrical run\n##Re-releases\n##Home media\n###Lawsuit\n#Reception\n##Critical response\n##Accolades\n#Legacy\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Free\n\nKarl R. Free (1903-1947) was an American painter, best known for his work on post office murals in the 1930s. His artwork often depicted everyday life, landscapes, and historical scenes. Free's murals were commissioned by the United States government as part of the New Deal program, aimed at promoting art and providing employment to artists during the Great Depression.\n\n#Early years\n\nKarl R. Free was born in 1903 in Ohio, United States. He grew up in a family of modest means and developed an interest in art from an early age. Free's talent was recognized by his teachers, who encouraged him to pursue a career in the arts. He went on to study at the Cleveland School of Art, where he honed his skills in painting and drawing.\n\nAfter completing his studies, Free moved to New York City to further his artistic career. He worked as a freelance artist, taking on various commissions and projects to make a living. In the late 1920s, Free became involved with the Whitney Museum of American Art, where he would eventually work as an assistant curator.\n\n#Whitney Museum assistant curator\n\nIn 1929, Free was appointed as an assistant curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art. During his time at the museum, Free was responsible for organizing exhibitions, acquiring new works, and assisting with the daily operations of the institution. He worked closely with the museum's founder, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, to promote American art and provide opportunities for emerging artists.\n\nFree's experience at the Whitney Museum helped him develop his curatorial skills and deepen his understanding of American art. He was particularly interested in promoting the work of living American artists, and he played an important role in shaping the museum's collection and exhibition program.\n\n#Post office murals\n\nIn the early 1930s, the United States government launched a program to commission murals for post offices across the country. The program was part of the New Deal, a series of initiatives aimed at promoting economic recovery and providing employment during the Great Depression. Free was one of the many artists who received commissions to create murals for post offices.\n\n##Washington, D.C.\n\n###Creation\n\nIn 1935, Free was commissioned to create a mural for the post office in Washington, D.C. The mural, titled \"The City,\" depicted a bustling urban scene, with people going about their daily business. Free spent several months working on the mural, which was painted in oil on canvas.\n\n###Reception and objections\n\nWhen \"The City\" was unveiled, it received mixed reviews from the public and the press. Some viewers praised the mural's energy and vitality, while others found it too chaotic and confusing. A few critics objected to the mural's depiction of urban life, arguing that it was too bleak and pessimistic.\n\n##Princeton, New Jersey\n\n###Creation\n\nIn 1936, Free was commissioned to create a mural for the post office in Princeton, New Jersey. The mural, titled \"The Industries of Princeton,\" depicted various scenes of industry and commerce in the town. Free spent several months researching and preparing for the mural, which was painted in oil on canvas.\n\n###Reception and objections\n\nWhen \"The Industries of Princeton\" was unveiled, it received generally positive reviews from the public and the press. Viewers praised the mural's detail and accuracy, and many appreciated its depiction of local industry and commerce. A few critics, however, objected to the mural's lack of artistic merit, arguing that it was too literal and lacking in imagination.\n\n#1939 and beyond\n\nIn 1939, Free's career was cut short when he died suddenly at the age of 36.

In July 1947, a strange object crashed on a ranch near Roswell, New Mexico, sparking a flurry of rumors and speculation about the nature of the object and the government's involvement. Over the years, the incident has evolved into a complex and multifaceted story, with various theories, hoaxes, and explanations emerging. This article provides an overview of the events surrounding the Roswell incident, as well as the various interpretations and theories that have arisen.\n\n# 1947 military balloon crash\n\nOn July 8, 1947, a strange object crashed on a ranch near Roswell, New Mexico. The object was initially described as a \"flying disc\" by the local military authorities, but was later identified as a top-secret military balloon. The balloon was part of a project called \"Project Mogul,\" which was designed to detect Soviet nuclear tests. The crash was reported by a local rancher, W.W. Brazel, who discovered the debris on his property. Brazel reported that the debris included metallic materials, plastic materials, and other unusual items.\n\n## UFO conspiracy theories (1947–1978)\n\nIn the years following the crash, rumors and speculation began to circulate about the nature of the object and the government's involvement. Many people believed that the object was a UFO, and that the government was covering up the truth. These theories were fueled by reports of strange lights and objects in the sky, as well as alleged sightings of alien bodies.\n\n### Aztec crashed saucer hoax\n\nIn 1948, a man named Silas Newton claimed that he had recovered a crashed saucer from a site near Aztec, New Mexico. Newton's story, which included descriptions of alien bodies and technology, was widely publicized and helped to fuel the growing UFO craze. However, Newton's story was later revealed to be a hoax.\n\n### Hangar 18\n\nAnother popular conspiracy theory surrounding the Roswell incident is the idea of \"Hangar 18,\" a supposed secret facility where the government allegedly stored recovered UFOs and alien bodies. This theory, which has been perpetuated by various books and films, claims that the government has been actively covering up the truth about UFOs and extraterrestrial life.\n\n# Roswell conspiracy theories (1978–1994)\n\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, a new wave of UFO enthusiasm swept the country, and the Roswell incident became a central part of the UFO mythology.\n\n## The Roswell Incident\n\nIn 1980, a book titled \"The Roswell Incident\" was published, which helped to revive interest in the story. The book, written by Charles Berlitz and William L. Moore, presented a detailed account of the incident and helped to popularize many of the conspiracy theories surrounding it.\n\n## Majestic 12 hoax\n\nIn 1980, a man named Jaime Shandera claimed to have discovered a secret government document called \"Majestic 12,\" which allegedly revealed the government's involvement in the Roswell incident. However, the document was later revealed to be a hoax.\n\n## Role of Glenn Dennis\n\nGlenn Dennis, a former mortician, claimed to have been involved in the recovery of alien bodies from the Roswell crash. Dennis's story, which included descriptions of the bodies and the government's alleged cover-up, was widely publicized and helped to fuel the conspiracy theories surrounding the incident.\n\n## Competing accounts and schism\n\nAs the years passed, various competing accounts of the Roswell incident emerged, leading to a schism within the UFO community. Some researchers, such as Stanton Friedman, argued that the incident was a genuine UFO event, while others, such as Karl Pflock, argued that the incident was a misidentification of a military balloon.\n\n### UFO Crash at Roswell\n\nIn 1991, a book titled \"UFO Crash at Roswell\" was published, which presented a detailed account of the incident and argued that the government had recovered a UFO.\n\n### Crash at Corona\n\nIn 1992, a book titled \"Crash at Corona\" was published, which presented a competing account of the incident and argued that the crash had occurred at a site near Corona, New Mexico, rather than Roswell.\n\n### The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell\n\nIn 1994, a book titled \"The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell\" was published, which presented a detailed account of the incident and argued that the government had recovered a UFO.\n\n# Air Force response\n\nIn response to the growing controversy surrounding the Roswell incident, the US Air Force launched a number of investigations and issued several reports. In 1994, the Air Force released a report titled \"The Roswell Report,\" which concluded that the incident was a misidentification of a military balloon. In 1997, the Air Force released a second report, which concluded that the incident was likely a combination of a misidentification of a balloon and a hoax.\n\n# Later theories and hoaxes (1994–present)\n\nIn the years following the Air Force's reports, a number of new theories and hoaxes emerged.\n\n## Alien Autopsy\n\nIn 1995, a film titled \"Alien Autopsy\" was released, which claimed to show footage of an alien autopsy from the Roswell incident. However, the film was later revealed to be a hoax.\n\n## The Day After Roswell\n\nIn 1997, a book titled \"The Day After Roswell\" was published, which presented a detailed account of the incident and argued that the government had recovered a UFO.\n\n## Related debunked or fringe theories\n\nA number of other debunked or fringe theories have emerged in recent years, including claims of alien technology and reverse-engineered UFOs.\n\n# Explanations\n\nA number of explanations have been proposed for the Roswell incident, including:\n\n## Project Mogul\n\nThe most widely accepted explanation is that the incident was a misidentification of a military balloon, part of a project called \"Project Mogul.\"\n\n## Anthropomorphic dummies\n\nAnother explanation is that the incident was a misidentification of anthropomorphic dummies, which were used in military experiments.\n\n## Roswell as modern myth and folklore\n\nThe Roswell incident has also been interpreted as a modern myth and folklore, reflecting the cultural and societal anxieties of the time.\n\n# Cultural impact\n\nThe Roswell incident has had a significant cultural impact, inspiring numerous books, films, and television shows.\n\n## Tourism and commercialization\n\nThe incident has also led to a thriving tourism industry, with numerous UFO-themed attractions and businesses emerging in the area.\n\n## Popular fiction\n\nThe Roswell incident has been featured in numerous works of popular fiction, including films, television shows, and books.\n\n## Statements by US Presidents\n\nThe incident has also been referenced by several US Presidents, including Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of reported UFO sightings\n* Project Blue Book\n* Unidentified flying object\n* Extraterrestrial life\n\n# References\n\n* Sources:\n* Books:\n* Articles:\n\n# External links\n\n* Roswell UFO Museum and Research Center\n* Project Blue Book\n* National UFO Reporting Center", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Roswell_incident\" following this outline:\n\n#1947 military balloon crash\n#UFO conspiracy theories (1947–1978)\n##Aztec crashed saucer hoax\n##Hangar 18\n#Roswell conspiracy theories (1978–1994)\n##The Roswell Incident\n##Majestic 12 hoax\n##Role of Glenn Dennis\n##Competing accounts and schism\n###UFO Crash at Roswell\n###Crash at Corona\n###The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell\n#Air Force response\n#Later theories and hoaxes (1994–present)\n##Alien Autopsy\n##The Day After Roswell\n##Related debunked or fringe theories\n#Explanations\n##Project Mogul\n##Anthropomorphic dummies\n##Roswell as modern myth and folklore\n#Cultural impact\n##Tourism and commercialization\n##Popular fiction\n##Statements by US Presidents\n#See also\n#References\n##Sources\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This approach to set theory was developed as an alternative to classical set theory, which relies heavily on non-constructive principles such as the law of excluded middle and the axiom of choice.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nConstructive set theory is based on the idea that mathematical objects, including sets, should be constructed in a explicit and intuitive way. This approach is in contrast to classical set theory, which often relies on indirect methods and non-constructive proofs. The constructive approach to set theory has its roots in the work of mathematicians such as L.E.J. Brouwer and Errett Bishop, who developed the foundations of constructive mathematics.\n\n**Constructive Outlook**\n\n### Preliminary on the use of intuitionistic logic\n\nConstructive set theory is based on intuitionistic logic, which is a branch of logic that rejects the law of excluded middle and the principle of non-contradiction. Intuitionistic logic is based on the idea that mathematical statements should be constructed in a explicit and intuitive way, rather than relying on indirect methods and non-constructive proofs.\n\n### Imposed restrictions on a set theory\n\nConstructive set theory imposes certain restrictions on the sets that can be constructed. For example, the power set axiom, which states that every set has a power set, is not accepted in constructive set theory. This is because the power set axiom implies the existence of non-constructive sets, which are not allowed in constructive set theory.\n\n### Metalogic\n\nMetalogic is the study of the properties of logical systems. In the context of constructive set theory, metalogic is used to study the properties of intuitionistic logic and its relationship to classical logic.\n\n### Anti-classical principles\n\nConstructive set theory rejects certain anti-classical principles, such as the law of excluded middle and the principle of non-contradiction. These principles are not accepted in constructive set theory because they imply the existence of non-constructive sets, which are not allowed.\n\n**History and Overview**\n\nConstructive set theory has its roots in the work of mathematicians such as L.E.J. Brouwer and Errett Bishop, who developed the foundations of constructive mathematics. The modern version of constructive set theory was developed in the 1970s and 1980s by mathematicians such as Per Martin-Löf and Peter Aczel.\n\n### Models\n\nThere are several models of constructive set theory, including the model of Aczel and the model of Martin-Löf. These models are based on different interpretations of the constructive approach to set theory.\n\n**Notation**\n\nThe notation used in constructive set theory is similar to the notation used in classical set theory. However, there are some differences in the notation used to represent constructive sets.\n\n### Language\n\nThe language used in constructive set theory is based on intuitionistic logic. This means that the language is constructive, and all mathematical statements must be constructed in an explicit and intuitive way.\n\n### Variables\n\nVariables in constructive set theory are used to represent constructive sets.

Two sets are equal if they are extensionally equivalent.\n\n### Alternative approaches\n\nThere are alternative approaches to equality in constructive set theory, including the use of intensional equality.

It is a common and usually benign condition, but can be alarming for parents and caregivers. Febrile seizures are a leading cause of pediatric emergency room visits and hospitalizations. This article provides an overview of the signs and symptoms, types, causes, mechanism, diagnosis, prevention, treatment, prognosis, and epidemiology of febrile seizures.\n\nSigns and Symptoms\n-------------------\n\nA febrile seizure typically begins with a sudden loss of consciousness, followed by convulsions, which can be generalized or focal. The seizure may be accompanied by a fever, which can be mild or high-grade. The child may also exhibit other symptoms, such as:\n\n* Loss of muscle tone\n* Stiffening of the body\n* Twitching or jerking movements\n* Eye rolling or deviation\n* Drooling or foaming at the mouth\n* Changes in breathing or heart rate\n\n## Types\n\nThere are two main types of febrile seizures: simple and complex.\n\n* Simple febrile seizures are the most common type, accounting for approximately 70-80% of cases. They are characterized by a short duration (less than 15 minutes), a single episode, and a generalized tonic-clonic seizure.\n* Complex febrile seizures are less common, accounting for approximately 20-30% of cases. They are characterized by a longer duration (greater than 15 minutes), multiple episodes, or focal seizures.\n\nCauses\n--------\n\nFebrile seizures are caused by a rapid increase in body temperature, which can be due to various factors, such as:\n\n* Viral or bacterial infections (e.g., ear infections, respiratory tract infections)\n* Vaccinations (e.g., measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine)\n* Environmental factors (e.g., hot weather, excessive clothing)\n* Genetic predisposition\n\nMechanism\n------------\n\nThe exact mechanism of febrile seizures is not fully understood, but it is believed to involve a combination of factors, including:\n\n* Neurotransmitter imbalance: Changes in the levels of neurotransmitters, such as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate, may contribute to the development of febrile seizures.\n* Brain hyperexcitability: The rapid increase in body temperature may lead to an increase in brain activity, making the brain more susceptible to seizures.\n* Immature brain development: The brains of young children are still developing, and the immature neural circuits may be more prone to seizures.\n\nDiagnosis\n----------\n\nThe diagnosis of febrile seizures is based on a combination of clinical evaluation, medical history, and laboratory tests. The healthcare provider will typically:\n\n* Perform a physical examination to assess the child's overall health and look for signs of infection or other underlying conditions.\n* Take a medical history to determine the child's vaccination status, previous illnesses, and family history of seizures.\n* Order laboratory tests, such as blood tests or imaging studies (e.g., computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans), to rule out other conditions that may be causing the seizures.\n\nPrevention\n------------\n\nWhile it is not possible to completely prevent febrile seizures, there are some measures that can be taken to reduce the risk:\n\n* Vaccinations: Keeping up-to-date with recommended vaccinations can help prevent infections that may lead to febrile seizures.\n* Fever management: Using antipyretic medications, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, to manage fever can help reduce the risk of febrile seizures.\n* Environmental measures: Avoiding exposure to extreme temperatures, using light clothing, and keeping the child hydrated can help reduce the risk of febrile seizures.\n\nTreatment\n----------\n\nThe treatment of febrile seizures typically involves managing the underlying fever and providing supportive care. The healthcare provider may:\n\n* Administer antipyretic medications, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, to reduce the fever.\n* Use benzodiazepines, such as diazepam or lorazepam, to stop the seizure if it is prolonged or recurrent.\n* Provide supportive care, such as hydration and rest, to help the child recover.\n\nPrognosis\n----------\n\nThe prognosis for children with febrile seizures is generally good. Most children outgrow febrile seizures by the age of 5-6 years, and the risk of developing epilepsy is low. However, some children may be at higher risk for developing epilepsy or other neurodevelopmental disorders.\n\nEpidemiology\n--------------\n\nFebrile seizures are a common condition, affecting approximately 2-5% of children under the age of 5 years. The peak age of onset is between 12-18 months, and boys are more likely to be affected than girls. The incidence of febrile seizures varies by region and country, with higher rates reported in developing countries.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Febrile_seizure\" following this outline:\n\n#Signs and symptoms\n##Types\n#Causes\n#Mechanism\n#Diagnosis\n#Prevention\n#Treatment\n#Prognosis\n#Epidemiology\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The party was founded in 1990 and has been active in California politics ever since. With a focus on ecological sustainability, social justice, and grassroots democracy, the Green Party of California has become a significant player in the state's electoral landscape.\n\n#History\n\n##Qualifying for elections\n\nThe Green Party of California qualified for the ballot in 1991, after a successful petition drive gathered over 80,000 signatures. This achievement allowed the party to participate in state and local elections, marking a significant milestone in its history.\n\n##Electoral milestones\n\nIn 1992, the party achieved its first electoral success when Ross Mirkarimi was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. This victory marked the beginning of a string of electoral successes for the party, which would go on to elect numerous candidates to local offices throughout the state.\n\n##Top-two primaries\n\nIn 2010, California voters approved Proposition 14, which established a top-two primary system for statewide and congressional elections. Under this system, the two candidates with the most votes in the primary would advance to the general election, regardless of party affiliation. While this change presented challenges for smaller parties like the Green Party, it also created opportunities for Greens to compete in the general election.\n\n#Platform\n\nThe Green Party of California's platform is based on the Ten Key Values of the Green Party of the United States. These values include grassroots democracy, social justice, ecological wisdom, nonviolence, decentralization, community-based economics, feminism, respect for diversity, personal and global responsibility, and future focus and sustainability. The party's platform also addresses a range of specific issues, including climate change, healthcare, education, and economic justice.\n\n#Organization\n\n##Membership\n\nMembership in the Green Party of California is open to anyone who supports the party's values and platform. Members can participate in local county councils, attend state party meetings, and vote in party elections. The party also has a number of caucuses and working groups focused on specific issues and constituencies.\n\n#Current elected officials\n\n##Mayoral offices\n\nAs of 2022, there are no Green Party members serving as mayors in California. However, the party has had success electing mayors in the past, including Gayle McLaughlin, who served as mayor of Richmond from 2007 to 2014.\n\n##Municipal councils\n\nThere are currently several Green Party members serving on municipal councils throughout California. These include:\n\n* John Selawsky, a member of the Berkeley City Council\n* Jesse Arreguin, a member of the Berkeley City Council\n* Pamela Jahn, a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors\n\n#Election results\n\n##Presidential\n\nThe Green Party of California has participated in every presidential election since 1992. While the party has not yet won a presidential election, its candidates have achieved significant vote totals in the state. In 2016, Jill Stein won over 278,000 votes in California, or 2.4% of the total.\n\n##Gubernatorial\n\nThe party has also participated in gubernatorial elections, with candidates including Peter Camejo, who ran for governor in 2002 and 2003, and Laura Wells, who ran in 2010.\n\n##Election qualifying\n\nIn order to qualify for the ballot, the Green Party of California must gather a certain number of signatures or achieve a certain percentage of the vote in a previous election. The party has successfully qualified for the ballot in every election cycle since 1991.\n\n#Notable members\n\n* Ross Mirkarimi, former member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors\n* Gayle McLaughlin, former mayor of Richmond\n* Peter Camejo, former gubernatorial candidate and member of the Green Party of the United States\n* Laura Wells, former gubernatorial candidate and member of the Green Party of the United States\n\n#See also\n\n* Green Party of the United States\n* Politics of California\n* List of Green Party politicians who have held office in the United States\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is a general overview of the Green Party of California.

His philosophical system, known as absolute idealism, had a profound impact on the development of modern thought, influencing fields such as philosophy, politics, art, and theology. This article provides an overview of Hegel's life, philosophical system, and influences, as well as his key writings and ideas.\n\n# Life\n\n## Formative years\n\n### Stuttgart, Tübingen, Berne, Frankfurt (1770–1800)\n\nHegel was born in Stuttgart, Württemberg, Germany, in 1770. His father, Georg Ludwig Hegel, was a secretary to the Duke of Württemberg, and his mother, Maria Magdalena Fromm, was a homemaker. Hegel's early education took place at the Stuttgart Gymnasium, where he excelled in his studies and developed a strong interest in philosophy and literature.\n\nIn 1788, Hegel enrolled at the University of Tübingen, where he studied theology, philosophy, and literature. During his time at Tübingen, Hegel became close friends with Friedrich Hölderlin and Friedrich Schelling, both of whom would go on to become influential figures in German philosophy.\n\nAfter completing his studies at Tübingen, Hegel worked as a private tutor in Berne and Frankfurt.

At Berlin, Hegel became one of the most prominent philosophers of his time, attracting students from all over Europe.\n\nDuring his time at Berlin, Hegel wrote several major works, including his _Philosophy of Right_ and _The Philosophy of History_. He also delivered several series of lectures, which were later published as books.\n\n# Influences\n\nHegel's philosophical system was influenced by a wide range of thinkers, including Immanuel Kant, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, and Friedrich Schelling. He was also influenced by the ideas of the French Revolution and the intellectual movements of his time, such as Romanticism and Idealism.\n\n# The Phenomenology of Spirit\n\nThe _Phenomenology of Spirit_ is one of Hegel's most famous works, published in 1807. In this book, Hegel explores the nature of consciousness and the development of the human spirit. He argues that the human spirit is a dialectical process, in which opposing forces are synthesized into higher levels of understanding.\n\n# Philosophical system\n\n## Science of Logic\n\nHegel's _Science of Logic_ is a comprehensive work that outlines his philosophical system. In this book, Hegel argues that logic is not just a matter of formal rules, but rather a way of understanding the nature of reality.\n\n## Philosophy of the real\n\nHegel's philosophy of the real is based on his idea that reality is a dialectical process, in which opposing forces are synthesized into higher levels of understanding. He argues that reality is not just a collection of individual objects, but rather a complex web of relationships.\n\n## The Philosophy of Nature\n\nHegel's _Philosophy of Nature_ is a work that explores the natural world and the laws that govern it. He argues that nature is a dialectical process, in which opposing forces are synthesized into higher levels of understanding.\n\n## The Philosophy of Spirit\n\n### Subjective spirit\n\nHegel's philosophy of subjective spirit explores the nature of human consciousness and the development of the human spirit. He argues that the human spirit is a dialectical process, in which opposing forces are synthesized into higher levels of understanding.\n\n### Objective spirit\n\nHegel's philosophy of objective spirit explores the nature of human society and the institutions that govern it. He argues that human society is a dialectical process, in which opposing forces are synthesized into higher levels of understanding.\n\n### Absolute spirit\n\nHegel's philosophy of absolute spirit explores the nature of art, religion, and philosophy. He argues that these three spheres of human activity are interconnected and that they represent the highest levels of human understanding.\n\n# Philosophy of art\n\nHegel's philosophy of art is based on his idea that art is a form of spiritual expression. He argues that art is a way of capturing the essence of reality and that it represents a higher level of understanding than science or philosophy.\n\n# Christianity\n\nHegel's philosophy of Christianity is based on his idea that Christianity represents a higher level of understanding than other religions. He argues that Christianity is a dialectical process, in which opposing forces are synthesized into higher levels of understanding.\n\n## Early Romantic writings\n\nHegel's early writings on Christianity were influenced by the ideas of Romanticism. He argued that Christianity was a form of spiritual expression that represented a higher level of understanding than other religions.\n\n## The Phenomenology of Spirit\n\nIn the _Phenomenology of Spirit_, Hegel explores the nature of Christianity and its relationship to other forms of spiritual expression.

Some have argued that his ideas represent a form of pantheism, while others have seen them as a form of orthodox Christianity.\n\n# Philosophy of history\n\nHegel's philosophy of history is based on his idea that history is a dialectical process, in which opposing forces are synthesized into higher levels of understanding.

The votes were widely condemned by the international community as illegitimate and a precursor to Russia's annexation of the regions.\n\n# Background\n\nThe referendums were announced by Russian-backed separatists in the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts on September 20, 2022, and were quickly endorsed by Russian President Vladimir Putin. The votes were seen as a response to the Ukrainian military's gains in the regions and a desire by Russia to solidify its control over the territories. The referendums were also viewed as a way for Russia to legitimize its presence in the regions and to create a pretext for further military action.\n\n# Organization\n\nThe referendums were organized by the Russian-backed separatist governments in the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, with assistance from the Russian government. The votes were held in areas under Russian control, and the ballots were printed in Russia. The referendums were overseen by Russian officials, and the results were widely seen as predetermined.\n\n# Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts\n\n## Questions\n\nIn the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, voters were asked whether they supported joining Russia as a federal subject. The question on the ballot was: \"Do you support the entry of the Donetsk People's Republic into the Russian Federation as a federal subject?\"\n\n## Results\n\nAccording to the results announced by the Russian-backed separatist governments, an overwhelming majority of voters supported joining Russia. In the Donetsk oblast, 99.2% of voters supported joining Russia, while in the Luhansk oblast, 98.4% supported joining. The turnout was reported to be high, with over 80% of eligible voters participating in both oblasts.\n\n# Kherson Oblast\n\n## Question\n\nIn the Kherson oblast, voters were asked whether they supported joining Russia as a federal subject. The question on the ballot was: \"Do you support the entry of the Kherson region into the Russian Federation as a federal subject?\"\n\n## Result\n\nAccording to the results announced by the Russian-backed separatist government, 87% of voters supported joining Russia. The turnout was reported to be over 70% of eligible voters.\n\n# Zaporizhzhia Oblast\n\n## Question\n\nIn the Zaporizhzhia oblast, voters were asked whether they supported joining Russia as a federal subject. The question on the ballot was: \"Do you support the entry of the Zaporizhzhia region into the Russian Federation as a federal subject?\"\n\n## Result\n\nAccording to the results announced by the Russian-backed separatist government, 93% of voters supported joining Russia. The turnout was reported to be over 80% of eligible voters.\n\n# Other planned locations\n\n## Mykolaiv Oblast\n\nThere were reports that a referendum on joining Russia was also planned in the Mykolaiv oblast, but it was not held due to the Ukrainian military's control over the region.\n\n## Kharkiv Oblast\n\nThere were also reports that a referendum on joining Russia was planned in the Kharkiv oblast, but it was not held due to the Ukrainian military's control over the region.\n\n# Opinion polls\n\nOpinion polls conducted in the regions before the referendums showed that a significant majority of the population opposed joining Russia. However, the polls were not conducted in areas under Russian control, and the results were widely seen as unreliable.\n\n# Opinions on the goals of holding referendums\n\nThe goals of holding the referendums were widely seen as a way for Russia to legitimize its presence in the regions and to create a pretext for further military action. The referendums were also viewed as a way for Russia to solidify its control over the territories and to prevent the Ukrainian government from regaining control.\n\n# Conduct\n\n## First day\n\nThe referendums were held over a period of five days, from September 23 to 27, 2022. On the first day, voters in the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts went to the polls, and the voting was reported to be peaceful.\n\n## Second day\n\nOn the second day, voters in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts went to the polls, and the voting was also reported to be peaceful.\n\n## Third day\n\nOn the third day, voters in the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts continued to vote, and the turnout was reported to be high.\n\n## Fourth day\n\nOn the fourth day, voters in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts continued to vote, and the turnout was also reported to be high.\n\n## Fifth day\n\nOn the fifth and final day, the voting was reported to be peaceful, and the turnout was reported to be high.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## Ukraine\n\nThe Ukrainian government condemned the referendums as illegitimate and a precursor to Russia's annexation of the regions. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy vowed to continue fighting to regain control over the territories.\n\n## Russia\n\nThe Russian government welcomed the results of the referendums and vowed to protect the regions from Ukrainian aggression. Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree recognizing the independence of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts.\n\n## International organisations\n\nThe international community widely condemned the referendums as illegitimate and a violation of international law. The United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres called for the respect of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\n## Countries\n\nMany countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany, condemned the referendums as illegitimate and a precursor to Russia's annexation of the regions.\n\n## Human rights organizations\n\nHuman rights organizations, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, condemned the referendums as a sham and a violation of human rights.\n\n## Other\n\nThe referendums were also condemned by many other organizations and individuals, including the European Union, the Council of Europe, and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe.\n\n# Possible consequences\n\nThe possible consequences of the referendums include the annexation of the regions by Russia, the escalation of the conflict in Ukraine, and the deterioration of relations between Russia and the West.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe aftermath of the referendums saw the Russian government's recognition of the independence of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, and the signing of a decree by Russian President Vladimir Putin to annex the regions.\n\n# See also\n\n## Likewise referendums\n\n* 2014 Crimean referendum\n* 2014 Donbass status referendums\n\n## Irredentism\n\n* Russian irredentism\n* Ukrainian nationalism\n\n## Geopolitical aspects\n\n* Russian-Ukrainian War\n* 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation\n\n# References\n\n# External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_annexation_referendums_in_Russian-occupied_Ukraine\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Organization\n#Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts\n##Questions\n##Results\n#Kherson Oblast\n##Question\n##Result\n#Zaporizhzhia Oblast\n##Question\n##Result\n#Other planned locations\n##Mykolaiv Oblast\n##Kharkiv Oblast\n#Opinion polls\n#Opinions on the goals of holding referendums\n#Conduct\n##First day\n##Second day\n##Third day\n##Fourth day\n##Fifth day\n#Reactions\n##Ukraine\n##Russia\n##International organisations\n##Countries\n##Human rights organizations\n##Other\n#Possible consequences\n#Aftermath\n#See also\n##Likewise referendums\n##Irredentism\n##Geopolitical aspects\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The Geelong Cats won the match by a margin of 81 points, claiming their 16th VFL/AFL premiership.\n\n# Background\n\nThe 2022 AFL season was the 126th season of the Australian Football League, the top-level Australian rules football competition. The season featured 18 teams, with each team playing 23 matches during the home-and-away season. The top eight teams then qualified for the finals, with the first-placed team earning a double chance in the finals. The Geelong Cats, led by coach Chris Scott, finished the home-and-away season on top of the ladder, earning the minor premiership. The Sydney Swans, led by coach John Longmire, finished the season in fourth place, but went on to defeat the Melbourne Football Club and the Collingwood Football Club in the finals to qualify for the Grand Final.\n\n# Ceremonies and entertainment\n\n## Parade\n\nThe traditional Grand Final parade was held on the morning of the match, with players and officials from both teams participating in a procession through the streets of Melbourne.

The Cats took a 63-point lead into the final break.\n\n## Final quarter\n\nThe final quarter saw the Cats continue to press their advantage, with a number of their players getting on the scoreboard. The Swans, meanwhile, were able to kick a few late goals, but it was too little, too late.

He is often referred to as the \"Father of the Constitution\" for his role in drafting and promoting the United States Constitution and the Bill of Rights. Madison was a key figure in the development of the Democratic-Republican Party and played a leading role in shaping the country's early years.\n\n#Early life and education\n\nJames Madison was born on March 16, 1751, in Port Conway, Virginia, to James Madison Sr. and Nelly Conway Madison. He was the oldest of 12 children, and his family was considered to be among the wealthiest in the area. Madison's early education took place at home, where he was tutored by his mother and a private tutor. In 1769, he attended the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University), where he studied philosophy, law, and politics. Madison graduated in 1771 and returned to Virginia, where he began to study law.\n\n#American Revolution and Articles of Confederation\n\nDuring the American Revolution, Madison served as a member of the Orange County Committee of Safety and as a delegate to the Virginia State Legislature. In 1780, he was appointed to the Continental Congress, where he played a key role in securing French support for the American cause. After the war, Madison returned to Virginia and became a strong advocate for a stronger central government. In 1787, he attended the Annapolis Convention, which laid the groundwork for the Constitutional Convention the following year.\n\n#Ratification of the Constitution\n\nIn 1787, Madison played a leading role in the Constitutional Convention, where he was instrumental in drafting the United States Constitution. He worked closely with George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, and other Founding Fathers to create a framework for the new government. After the convention, Madison returned to Virginia and became a leading advocate for the ratification of the Constitution. He wrote several essays, including Federalist No. 10, which helped to persuade the public of the need for a stronger central government.\n\n#Congressman and party leader (1789–1801)\n\n##Election to Congress\n\nIn 1789, Madison was elected to the United States House of Representatives, where he became a key figure in the development of the Democratic-Republican Party. He worked closely with Thomas Jefferson, who was serving as Secretary of State, to promote the principles of limited government and individual liberty.\n\n##Bill of Rights\n\nIn 1789, Madison was instrumental in drafting the Bill of Rights, which was added to the Constitution in 1791. He worked closely with George Mason and other Founding Fathers to create a set of amendments that would protect individual liberties and limit the power of the federal government.\n\n##Founding the Democratic–Republican Party\n\nIn the 1790s, Madison and Jefferson founded the Democratic-Republican Party, which opposed the Federalist Party and its vision of a strong central government. Madison became a leading figure in the party and played a key role in shaping its platform and policies.\n\n##Marriage and family\n\nIn 1794, Madison married Dolley Payne Todd, a widow with one son. The couple had no children of their own, but they raised Dolley's son from her previous marriage.\n\n##Adams presidency\n\nDuring the presidency of John Adams, Madison opposed the Alien and Sedition Acts, which he believed were an attack on civil liberties. He also opposed the Quasi-War with France, which he believed was an unnecessary and unconstitutional use of presidential power.\n\n#Secretary of State (1801–1809)\n\nIn 1801, Madison was appointed Secretary of State by President Thomas Jefferson. He played a key role in shaping the country's foreign policy, including the Louisiana Purchase and the Embargo Act of 1807.\n\n##1808 presidential election\n\nIn 1808, Madison was elected President of the United States, defeating Charles Pinckney in the general election. He became the fourth President of the United States and the first to be born after the American Revolution.\n\n#Presidency (1809–1817)\n\n##Inauguration and cabinet\n\nMadison was inaugurated as President on March 4, 1809. He appointed a cabinet that included Robert Smith as Secretary of State, Paul Hamilton as Secretary of the Navy, and William Eustis as Secretary of War.\n\n##War of 1812\n\n###Prelude to war\n\nDuring Madison's presidency, tensions with Great Britain increased over issues such as trade restrictions, impressment of American sailors, and British support for Native American resistance. In 1812, Madison asked Congress to declare war on Great Britain, which they did on June 18, 1812.\n\n###Military actions\n\nThe War of 1812 was marked by a series of military defeats for the United States, including the burning of Washington, D.C. by British troops. Madison himself was forced to flee the capital and seek refuge in the countryside. However, the war also saw several American victories, including the Battle of Lake Erie and the Battle of New Orleans.\n\n##Postwar period and decline of the Federalist opposition\n\nAfter the War of 1812, Madison's popularity increased, and he was able to consolidate his power and influence. The Federalist Party, which had opposed the war, declined in influence and eventually disappeared.\n\n##Native American policy\n\nMadison's Native American policy was marked by a series of treaties and agreements that expanded American territory and influence. However, he also faced opposition from Native American leaders, including Tecumseh, who resisted American expansion.\n\n##Election of 1816\n\nIn 1816, Madison declined to run for re-election, and James Monroe was elected as his successor. Madison retired to his estate at Montpelier, where he lived out the rest of his life.\n\n#Post-presidency (1817–1836)\n\n##Death\n\nJames Madison died on June 28, 1836, at the age of 85. He was buried on his estate at Montpelier, where he was later joined by his wife Dolley.\n\n#Political and religious views\n\n##Federalism\n\nMadison was a strong advocate for federalism, which he believed was essential for a strong and effective government. However, he also believed in the importance of individual liberties and limited government.\n\n##Religion\n\nMadison was a member of the Episcopal Church and believed in the importance of separation of church and state. He opposed the establishment of a national church and believed that individuals should be free to practice their own religion.\n\n#Slavery\n\nMadison owned slaves throughout his life, but he also believed in the importance of gradual emancipation. He opposed the expansion of slavery and believed that it was morally wrong.\n\n#Legacy\n\nJames Madison's legacy is complex and multifaceted. He is remembered as the \"Father of the Constitution\" and a key figure in the development of the Democratic-Republican Party. He is also remembered for his role in shaping the country's early years and his commitment to individual liberties and limited government.\n\n#Notes\n\nNote: This article is a summary of James Madison's life and presidency.

The area has become synonymous with a large homeless encampment and the social and economic issues associated with it. This article provides an overview of the history and current situation surrounding Mass. and Cass.\n\nAftermath of Long Island closure\n\nThe closure of the Long Island shelter in 2014 had a significant impact on the homeless population in Boston. The shelter, which provided emergency housing and support services for approximately 400 individuals, was shut down due to structural damage and safety concerns. The closure left many individuals without access to essential services, leading to an influx of people seeking assistance in other areas of the city.\n\nClosure of Long Island services\n\nThe closure of the Long Island shelter resulted in the loss of essential services, including emergency housing, food, and medical care. Many individuals who relied on these services were forced to seek alternative accommodations, leading to an increase in homelessness in other areas of the city. The loss of services also had a significant impact on the mental health and well-being of individuals who relied on the shelter.\n\nShelter openings at Mass. and Cass\n\nIn response to the closure of the Long Island shelter, several temporary shelters were opened in the area surrounding Mass. and Cass. These shelters provided emergency housing and support services for individuals in need. However, the shelters were often overcrowded, and the services provided were limited. The shelters also struggled to address the underlying issues driving homelessness, such as poverty, addiction, and mental illness.\n\nBusiness concerns\n\nThe growth of the homeless encampment at Mass. and Cass has raised concerns among local business owners. Many businesses in the area have reported a decline in foot traffic and sales, citing the presence of homeless individuals and the associated crime and disorder. Some businesses have also reported incidents of theft, vandalism, and harassment. The business community has called for increased action to address the issue, including the provision of additional services and support for homeless individuals.\n\nPopulation\n\nThe population of the homeless encampment at Mass. and Cass is estimated to be in the hundreds. The exact number is difficult to determine, as many individuals come and go, and some may not be accounted for in official counts. However, it is clear that the encampment has grown significantly in recent years, with many individuals seeking shelter and support in the area.\n\nEfforts to clear out the encampment\n\nEfforts to clear out the encampment at Mass. and Cass have been ongoing for several years. These efforts have included the provision of alternative housing and support services, as well as law enforcement actions to address crime and disorder.\n\nOperation Clean Sweep\n\nIn 2019, the City of Boston launched Operation Clean Sweep, a multi-agency effort to address the homeless encampment at Mass. and Cass. The operation involved the provision of alternative housing and support services, as well as law enforcement actions to address crime and disorder. However, the operation was met with criticism from some advocates, who argued that it did not provide sufficient support for homeless individuals and that it prioritized law enforcement over social services.\n\nSheriff's proposal to force treatment of individuals\n\nIn 2020, the Suffolk County Sheriff proposed a plan to force treatment on individuals struggling with addiction at Mass. and Cass. The plan would have involved the use of court-ordered treatment, with individuals who refused treatment facing potential incarceration. However, the plan was met with opposition from some advocates, who argued that it did not address the underlying causes of addiction and that it prioritized punishment over treatment.\n\nExecutive order to clear encampment\n\nIn 2020, the Mayor of Boston issued an executive order to clear the encampment at Mass. and Cass. The order authorized the use of law enforcement to clear the area, with individuals who refused to leave facing potential arrest. However, the order was met with criticism from some advocates, who argued that it did not provide sufficient support for homeless individuals and that it prioritized law enforcement over social services.\n\nSweep and diversion to low-threshold shelters\n\nIn 2020, the City of Boston conducted a sweep of the encampment at Mass. and Cass, with the goal of diverting individuals to low-threshold shelters. Low-threshold shelters provide emergency housing and support services with minimal barriers to entry, such as sobriety requirements. The sweep was accompanied by outreach efforts to provide support and services to homeless individuals. However, the effectiveness of the sweep in reducing homelessness in the area is unclear.\n\nCollection of syringes\n\nThe collection of syringes has become a significant issue at Mass. and Cass. Many individuals in the area struggle with addiction, and the use of syringes is common. However, the disposal of syringes has become a concern, with many syringes being left on the ground or in public areas. The City of Boston has implemented a program to collect syringes, with the goal of reducing the risk of transmission of blood-borne diseases.\n\nRise in violence\n\nViolence has become a growing concern at Mass. and Cass. Many individuals in the area struggle with addiction and mental illness, and the use of violence is not uncommon. However, the rise in violence has also been attributed to the presence of gangs and other criminal activity. The City of Boston has increased police presence in the area in an effort to address the issue.\n\nPolice presence\n\nThe police presence at Mass. and Cass has increased in recent years, with the goal of addressing crime and disorder. However, the effectiveness of the increased police presence in reducing crime is unclear.\n\nOvertime spending\n\nThe Boston Police Department has reported significant overtime spending in the area surrounding Mass. and Cass. The overtime spending is attributed to the increased police presence in the area, with officers working extended hours to address crime and disorder.\n\nLack of intervention in violence\n\nDespite the increased police presence, there have been reports of a lack of intervention in violent incidents at Mass. and Cass. Some advocates have argued that the police presence prioritizes enforcement over intervention, with officers failing to provide adequate support and services to victims of violence.\n\nCommand center\n\nIn 2020, the City of Boston established a command center in the area surrounding Mass. and Cass. The command center provides a central location for law enforcement and social services to coordinate efforts to address crime and disorder. However, the effectiveness of the command center in reducing crime and improving services for homeless individuals is unclear.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Mass._and_Cass\" following this outline:\n\n#Aftermath of Long Island closure\n##Closure of Long Island services\n##Shelter openings at Mass. and Cass\n#Business concerns\n#Population\n#Efforts to clear out the encampment\n##Operation Clean Sweep\n##Sheriff's proposal to force treatment of individuals\n##Executive order to clear encampment\n##Sweep and diversion to low-threshold shelters\n#Collection of syringes\n#Rise in violence\n#Police presence\n##Overtime spending\n##Lack of intervention in violence\n##Command center\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

As a key member of the Second Viennese School, Webern's music had a profound influence on the course of Western classical music.\n\nBiography\n----------\n\n### 1883–1908: Upbringing between late Imperial Vienna and countryside\n\nWebern was born on December 3, 1883, in Vienna, Austria-Hungary. His family moved frequently during his childhood, spending time in various towns and cities, including Graz, Klagenfurt, and Vienna.\n\n#### Bucolic Heimat\n\nWebern's childhood was marked by a deep connection to nature and the Austrian countryside. His family would often spend summers in the country, where he developed a love for hiking, fishing, and the outdoors. This idyllic upbringing would later influence his music, particularly in his use of natural imagery and folk melodies.\n\n#### University\n\nWebern began his musical studies at the University of Vienna, where he was a student of Arnold Schoenberg. Under Schoenberg's guidance, Webern developed his compositional skills and began to explore the possibilities of atonality.\n\n#### Schoenberg and his circle\n\nWebern became a member of Schoenberg's circle, a group of composers and artists who were pushing the boundaries of modern music. This circle included other notable composers, such as Alban Berg and Erwin Stein. Through his association with Schoenberg and his circle, Webern was exposed to the latest developments in atonality and twelve-tone technique.\n\n### 1908–1918: Early adulthood in Austria-Hungary and German Empire\n\nWebern's early adulthood was marked by a series of personal and professional struggles.\n\n#### Marriage\n\nIn 1911, Webern married Wilhelmine Mörtl, a singer and pianist. The couple had two children, a daughter named Amalie and a son named Peter.\n\n#### Early conducting career\n\nWebern began his conducting career in 1908, leading a series of concerts in Vienna and other Austrian cities. He quickly gained a reputation as a skilled conductor, known for his precision and attention to detail.\n\n#### Psychotherapy\n\nIn 1912, Webern underwent a series of psychotherapy sessions with Alfred Adler, a prominent Viennese psychoanalyst. These sessions helped Webern to work through his personal struggles and find a greater sense of purpose and direction.\n\n#### \"Old song\" of \"lost paradise\"\n\nWebern's music from this period is characterized by a sense of longing and nostalgia. Many of his works feature folk melodies and natural imagery, evoking a sense of a lost paradise.\n\n#### World War I\n\nWebern served in the Austro-Hungarian Army during World War I, stationed on the Italian front. The experience had a profound impact on him, leading to a deeper exploration of his own mortality and the human condition.\n\n#### Austrian defeat and socioeconomic strain\n\nThe defeat of Austria-Hungary in 1918 led to a period of socioeconomic strain, as the country struggled to rebuild and redefine itself. Webern's music from this period reflects this uncertainty, often featuring dissonant harmonies and fragmented melodies.\n\n### 1918–1933: Rise in Rotes Wien (Interwar Vienna)\n\nWebern's career began to flourish in the 1920s, as he became a leading figure in the musical life of Vienna.\n\n#### Society for Private Musical Performances\n\nIn 1919, Webern co-founded the Society for Private Musical Performances, a group dedicated to promoting new and experimental music.

His works were regularly performed by leading ensembles, and he became a respected figure in the city's musical community.\n\n### 1933–1938: Perseverance in Schwarzes Wien (Austrofascist Vienna)\n\nWebern's career was marked by a series of challenges in the 1930s, as Austria became increasingly fascist.\n\n#### Marginalization at home\n\nWebern's music was seen as too radical and avant-garde by the Austrofascist authorities, leading to a decline in performances and commissions.\n\n#### Besieged milieu and political confusion\n\nThe rise of Nazism in Germany and Austria created a sense of uncertainty and fear among artists and intellectuals. Webern's music from this period reflects this confusion, often featuring dissonant harmonies and fragmented melodies.\n\n#### Visiting conducting career\n\nWebern continued to conduct abroad, leading performances in countries such as Switzerland and the Netherlands.\n\n### 1938–1939: Inner emigration in Nazi Germany\n\nIn 1938, Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany, leading to a period of inner emigration for Webern.\n\n#### Anschluss\n\nWebern's music was banned by the Nazi authorities, and he was forced to flee to Austria's countryside.\n\n#### Kristallnacht and recoil\n\nThe Kristallnacht pogrom in 1938 marked a turning point for Webern, as he became increasingly disillusioned with the Nazi regime.\n\n### 1939–1945: Hope and disillusionment during World War II\n\nWebern's music from this period reflects a sense of hope and disillusionment, as he struggled to come to terms with the Nazi occupation.\n\n#### Swiss and Reich prospects\n\nWebern considered emigrating to Switzerland or the United States, but ultimately remained in Austria.\n\n#### Wartime hopes and reality\n\nWebern's music from this period often features a sense of longing and nostalgia, as he looked back to a lost past.\n\n#### Refuge and death in Mittersill\n\nWebern was killed in 1945, while in hiding in the Austrian town of Mittersill. He was shot by an American soldier who was part of a group of occupation forces.\n\nMusic\n------\n\nWebern's music is characterized by a sense of precision and attention to detail, often featuring complex harmonies and fragmented melodies.\n\n### 1899–1908: Formative juvenilia and emergence from study\n\nWebern's early works were influenced by the music of Richard Wagner and Gustav Mahler.\n\n### 1908–1914: Atonality and aphorisms\n\nWebern's music from this period is marked by a sense of experimentation and innovation, as he explored the possibilities of atonality.\n\n### 1914–1924: Mid-period Lieder\n\nWebern's songs from this period feature complex harmonies and fragmented melodies, often evoking a sense of longing and nostalgia.\n\n### 1924–1945: Formal coherence and expansion\n\nWebern's music from this period is characterized by a sense of formal coherence and expansion, as he developed his unique style.\n\n### Arrangements and orchestrations\n\nWebern was a skilled arranger and orchestrator, often reworking the music of other composers for specific ensembles.\n\nReception, influence, and legacy\n--------------------------------\n\nWebern's music had a profound influence on the development of Western classical music, particularly in the areas of atonality and twelve-tone technique.\n\n### Performance practice\n\nWebern's music is known for its complexity and technical difficulty, requiring a high level of skill and precision from performers.\n\n### Contemporaries\n\nWebern's contemporaries included other notable composers, such as Arnold Schoenberg and Alban Berg.\n\n#### Artists\n\nWebern's music was influenced by the work of artists such as Wassily Kandinsky and Kazimir Malevich.\n\n#### Musicians\n\nWebern's music was performed by leading musicians of his time, including the Kolisch Quartet and the Vienna Philharmonic.\n\n### 1947–1950s: (Re)discovery and post-Webernism\n\nWebern's music experienced a resurgence in popularity in the 1940s and 1950s, particularly among composers such as Pierre Boulez and Karlheinz Stockhausen.\n\n### 1950s onward: Beyond (late) Webern\n\nWebern's legacy continued to influence composers in the decades following his death, particularly in the areas of atonality and twelve-tone technique.\n\n### Eastern Europe\n\nWebern's music was performed and admired in Eastern Europe, particularly in countries such as Poland and Czechoslovakia.\n\n#### Eastern Bloc\n\nWebern's music was seen as a symbol of Western cultural values, and was often performed in secret by musicians in the Eastern Bloc.\n\n#### Soviet Russia\n\nWebern's music was banned in Soviet Russia, but continued to be admired and performed by musicians in secret.\n\n### Dance\n\nWebern's music has been used in various dance productions, particularly in the area of modern dance.\n\n### Since the 1980s: Reappraisals and historiography\n\nWebern's music has undergone a series of reappraisals and reevaluations, particularly in the areas of atonality and twelve-tone technique.\n\nRecordings by Webern\n-------------------\n\nWebern was a prolific recording artist, and his music has been recorded by numerous ensembles and musicians.\n\nNotes\n------\n\nThis article provides a comprehensive overview of Anton Webern's life and music, including his biography, musical style, and legacy.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n* Bibliography\n\t+ Adorno, Theodor W.

The storm was the sixth named storm, fourth hurricane, and third major hurricane of the 2022 Atlantic hurricane season. Fiona caused catastrophic damage and loss of life in several countries, particularly in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic.\n\n#Meteorological history\n\nFiona formed from a tropical wave that emerged from the west coast of Africa on September 1, 2022. The wave moved westward across the Atlantic, gradually developing a closed circulation and convection. On September 14, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring the system, and by September 15, it had developed into a tropical depression. The depression intensified into Tropical Storm Fiona on September 16, while located about 800 miles (1,300 km) east of the Leeward Islands.\n\nFiona continued to intensify as it moved westward, becoming a hurricane on September 17. The storm then underwent rapid intensification, reaching Category 3 strength on September 18 and Category 4 strength on September 19. Fiona's maximum sustained winds reached 140 mph (220 km/h) on September 20, while the storm was located about 100 miles (160 km) south of Puerto Rico.\n\n#Preparations\n\nAs Fiona approached the Caribbean, several countries issued tropical storm watches and warnings. The governments of Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and the Turks and Caicos Islands declared states of emergency, while the U.S. National Weather Service issued flash flood watches for parts of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nIn Puerto Rico, residents stocked up on food, water, and supplies, while many tourists were evacuated from the island. The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) activated its emergency response plan, while the island's water authority, the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (PRASA), took steps to protect its infrastructure.\n\n#Impact\n\nFiona caused significant damage and loss of life in several Caribbean countries and Eastern Canada.\n\n##Guadeloupe\n\nFiona brought strong winds and heavy rainfall to Guadeloupe, causing power outages and damage to homes and infrastructure. The storm's strong winds knocked down trees and power lines, while the heavy rainfall caused flooding in several areas.\n\n##Puerto Rico\n\nFiona made landfall in Puerto Rico on September 18, bringing catastrophic damage and flooding to the island. The storm's strong winds knocked down trees and power lines, while the heavy rainfall caused widespread flooding and landslides. The storm's center passed directly over the city of Ponce, causing significant damage to homes and infrastructure.\n\nThe Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) reported that over 1 million customers lost power, while the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (PRASA) reported that over 500,000 customers lost access to running water. The storm's flooding and landslides caused several fatalities, while many residents were left stranded in their homes.\n\n##Dominican Republic\n\nFiona made landfall in the Dominican Republic on September 19, causing widespread damage and flooding. The storm's strong winds knocked down trees and power lines, while the heavy rainfall caused widespread flooding and landslides. The storm's center passed directly over the city of Cabo San Rafael, causing significant damage to homes and infrastructure.\n\nThe Dominican Republic's emergency management agency, the General Directorate of Civil Defense (DGCD), reported that over 1,000 homes were damaged or destroyed, while over 10,000 customers lost power. The storm's flooding and landslides caused several fatalities, while many residents were left stranded in their homes.\n\n##Turks and Caicos\n\nFiona brought strong winds and heavy rainfall to the Turks and Caicos Islands, causing power outages and damage to homes and infrastructure. The storm's strong winds knocked down trees and power lines, while the heavy rainfall caused flooding in several areas.\n\n##Antigua\n\nFiona brought strong winds and heavy rainfall to Antigua, causing power outages and damage to homes and infrastructure. The storm's strong winds knocked down trees and power lines, while the heavy rainfall caused flooding in several areas.\n\n##Bermuda\n\nFiona brought strong winds and heavy rainfall to Bermuda, causing power outages and damage to homes and infrastructure. The storm's strong winds knocked down trees and power lines, while the heavy rainfall caused flooding in several areas.\n\n##Eastern Canada\n\nFiona brought strong winds and heavy rainfall to Eastern Canada, particularly in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. The storm's strong winds knocked down trees and power lines, while the heavy rainfall caused flooding in several areas. The storm's center passed directly over the city of Halifax, causing significant damage to homes and infrastructure.\n\n#Aftermath\n\n##Puerto Rico\n\nIn the aftermath of Fiona, Puerto Rico faced significant challenges in recovering from the storm's damage. The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) worked to restore power to affected areas, while the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (PRASA) worked to restore access to running water.\n\nThe Puerto Rican government established several shelters for displaced residents, while the American Red Cross and other relief organizations provided food, water, and other supplies to affected areas.\n\n##Dominican Republic\n\nIn the aftermath of Fiona, the Dominican Republic faced significant challenges in recovering from the storm's damage. The Dominican Republic's emergency management agency, the General Directorate of Civil Defense (DGCD), worked to assess the damage and provide relief to affected areas.\n\nThe Dominican government established several shelters for displaced residents, while the American Red Cross and other relief organizations provided food, water, and other supplies to affected areas.\n\n#Retirement\n\nDue to the significant damage and loss of life caused by Fiona, the name \"Fiona\" was retired from use in the Atlantic Basin by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in 2023.\n\n#See also\n\n* List of Atlantic hurricanes\n* List of Category 4 Atlantic hurricanes\n* List of retired Atlantic hurricane names\n\n#References\n\n*Note: This article does not include any citations or references, as per the requirements.\n\n#External links\n\n*Note: This article does not include any external links, as per the requirements.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Hurricane_Fiona\" following this outline:\n\n#Meteorological history\n#Preparations\n#Impact\n##Guadeloupe\n##Puerto Rico\n##Dominican Republic\n##Turks and Caicos\n##Antigua\n##Bermuda\n##Eastern Canada\n#Aftermath\n##Puerto Rico\n##Dominican Republic\n#Retirement\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The cyclone caused significant damage and disruption, resulting in loss of life, displacement of people, and economic losses.\n\n# Meteorological history\n\nCyclone Gabrielle formed as a tropical low on February 5, 2023, in the Coral Sea, northeast of Australia. The system gradually intensified, and by February 8, it had developed into a tropical cyclone, with sustained winds of 65 km/h (40 mph). Over the next few days, Gabrielle continued to strengthen, reaching Category 3 cyclone status on February 10, with winds of 120 km/h (75 mph).\n\nAs the cyclone moved southeast, it began to interact with a mid-latitude trough, which led to a significant increase in wind shear. Despite this, Gabrielle continued to maintain its intensity, and on February 12, it reached its peak intensity, with winds of 150 km/h (90 mph) and a central pressure of 970 hPa (28.64 inHg).\n\nOn February 13, Gabrielle made landfall in New Zealand, bringing strong winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surges to the eastern coast of the North Island.\n\n# Effects\n\n## Melanesia\n\nCyclone Gabrielle brought strong winds and heavy rainfall to several islands in Melanesia, including Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands, and New Caledonia. The cyclone caused widespread damage to homes, infrastructure, and crops, particularly in Vanuatu, where over 1,000 people were displaced.\n\n## Norfolk Island\n\nGabrielle passed close to Norfolk Island on February 11, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall. The island experienced significant disruption, with power outages, road closures, and damage to buildings.\n\n## New Zealand\n\nCyclone Gabrielle had a significant impact on New Zealand, particularly in the North Island. The cyclone brought strong winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surges to the eastern coast, causing widespread damage and disruption.\n\n### Northland\n\nNorthland was one of the hardest-hit regions, with widespread power outages, road closures, and damage to homes and infrastructure. The region experienced significant flooding, particularly in the towns of Kaikohe and Kawakawa.\n\n### Auckland\n\nAuckland experienced strong winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surges, causing significant disruption to the city. The Auckland Harbour Bridge was closed due to strong winds, and several buildings were damaged.\n\n### Waikato\n\nThe Waikato region experienced significant flooding, particularly in the town of Cambridge. The Waikato River burst its banks, causing widespread damage to homes and infrastructure.\n\n### Gisborne\n\nGisborne was one of the worst-hit regions, with widespread damage to homes, infrastructure, and crops. The city experienced significant flooding, with several buildings and roads damaged.\n\n### Hawke's Bay\n\nHawke's Bay experienced significant flooding, particularly in the town of Napier. The region's agricultural sector was severely impacted, with significant losses to crops and livestock.\n\n### Manawatū-Whanganui\n\nThe Manawatū-Whanganui region experienced significant flooding, particularly in the town of Whanganui. The region's rural communities were severely impacted, with several homes and buildings damaged.\n\n### Other regions\n\nOther regions, including the Bay of Plenty, Taranaki, and Wellington, also experienced significant disruption, with strong winds, heavy rainfall, and power outages.\n\n# Responses\n\n## New Zealand\n\nThe New Zealand government, civil society, and emergency services responded quickly to the disaster, with relief efforts focused on search and rescue, provision of aid, and rebuilding.\n\n### Relief\n\nRelief efforts were coordinated by the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), with support from local councils, emergency services, and non-governmental organizations. Aid was provided to affected communities, including food, water, shelter, and medical care.\n\n### Government\n\nThe New Zealand government pledged significant funding for relief and recovery efforts, including NZD 100 million for immediate relief and NZD 500 million for long-term recovery. The government also established a Cyclone Gabrielle Recovery Office to coordinate recovery efforts.\n\n### Civil society\n\nCivil society organizations, including non-governmental organizations and community groups, played a significant role in responding to the disaster, providing aid, support, and advocacy to affected communities.\n\n### Inquiries\n\nThe New Zealand government announced an independent inquiry into the response to Cyclone Gabrielle, to identify lessons learned and areas for improvement.\n\n### Managed retreat\n\nThe New Zealand government also announced plans to implement managed retreat in affected areas, to reduce the risk of future flooding and damage. Managed retreat involves the planned relocation of homes, infrastructure, and communities away from high-risk areas.\n\n# Retirement\n\nCyclone Gabrielle was retired from the list of tropical cyclone names in the South Pacific by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in 2023, due to the significant damage and loss of life caused by the cyclone.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of retired tropical cyclone names\n* Cyclone season\n* Tropical cyclone\n\n# References\n\n*Note: This section will be populated with references once the article is complete*\n\n# External links\n\n*Note: This section will be populated with external links once the article is complete*", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Cyclone_Gabrielle\" following this outline:\n\n#Meteorological history\n#Effects\n##Melanesia\n##Norfolk Island\n##New Zealand\n###Northland\n###Auckland\n###Waikato\n###Gisborne\n###Hawke's Bay\n###Manawatū-Whanganui\n###Other regions\n#Responses\n##New Zealand\n###Relief\n###Government\n###Civil society\n###Inquiries\n###Managed retreat\n#Retirement\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The case centers on allegations of conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, obstruction of an official proceeding, and conspiracy against rights, all related to Trump's efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.\n\n# Background\n\n## Accusations of Electoral Fraud and Attempts to Overturn the Election\n\nFollowing the 2020 presidential election, Trump and his allies made numerous allegations of electoral fraud, despite a lack of credible evidence to support these claims. Trump's campaign and its supporters filed numerous lawsuits in various states, seeking to overturn the election results. These lawsuits were largely unsuccessful, with many being dismissed due to lack of evidence or on procedural grounds.\n\n## January 6 Capitol Attack and Investigations\n\nOn January 6, 2021, a mob of Trump supporters stormed the United States Capitol, in an attempt to disrupt the certification of the presidential election results. The attack resulted in the deaths of five people, including a police officer, and injuries to many others. The incident sparked widespread outrage and condemnation, and led to the launch of multiple investigations, including a congressional inquiry and a federal probe.\n\n# Original Indictment and Arraignment\n\nOn August 1, 2023, a federal grand jury returned an indictment against Trump, charging him with four counts related to his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. The indictment was unsealed on August 3, 2023, and Trump was arraigned on August 24, 2023. During the arraignment, Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges.\n\n# Superseding Indictment and Arraignment\n\nOn September 12, 2023, a superseding indictment was returned against Trump, which included additional charges and allegations. Trump was arraigned on the superseding indictment on October 2, 2023, and again pleaded not guilty to all charges.\n\n# Statements in the Indictment\n\n## Allegations and Statements\n\nThe indictment alleges that Trump and his co-conspirators engaged in a scheme to defraud the United States by attempting to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. The indictment further alleges that Trump and his co-conspirators used various means, including false statements and intimidation, to pressure state officials to change the outcome of the election.\n\n## Count One: Conspiracy to Defraud the United States\n\nThe first count of the indictment charges Trump with conspiracy to defraud the United States, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371. The count alleges that Trump and his co-conspirators engaged in a scheme to defraud the United States by attempting to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.\n\n## Further Allegations and Statements\n\nThe indictment further alleges that Trump and his co-conspirators made numerous false statements about the election, including claims that the election was \"stolen\" and that there was widespread voter fraud. The indictment also alleges that Trump and his co-conspirators attempted to intimidate state officials into changing the outcome of the election.\n\n## Count Two: Conspiracy to Obstruct an Official Proceeding\n\nThe second count of the indictment charges Trump with conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1512(k). The count alleges that Trump and his co-conspirators engaged in a scheme to obstruct the certification of the presidential election results.\n\n## Count Three: Obstruction of an Official Proceeding\n\nThe third count of the indictment charges Trump with obstruction of an official proceeding, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1512(c). The count alleges that Trump and his co-conspirators engaged in conduct that obstructed the certification of the presidential election results.\n\n## Count Four: Conspiracy against Rights\n\nThe fourth count of the indictment charges Trump with conspiracy against rights, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 241. The count alleges that Trump and his co-conspirators engaged in a scheme to deprive individuals of their right to vote.\n\n# Co-conspirators\n\nThe indictment names several co-conspirators, including former Trump advisors and associates. The co-conspirators are alleged to have played various roles in the scheme to defraud the United States and obstruct the certification of the presidential election results.\n\n# Pretrial Proceedings\n\n## Initial Timetable\n\nFollowing Trump's arraignment, the court set an initial timetable for pretrial proceedings. The timetable included deadlines for the filing of pretrial motions and the exchange of discovery materials.\n\n## Protective Orders and Security Measures\n\nThe court also issued protective orders and security measures to protect sensitive information and ensure the safety of witnesses and parties involved in the case.\n\n## Other Pre-trial Motions\n\nTrump's defense team filed several pre-trial motions, including a motion to dismiss the indictment and a motion to suppress evidence. The prosecution filed responses to these motions, and the court is expected to rule on them in the coming weeks.\n\n## Immunity Dispute\n\nA dispute arose over the issue of immunity for certain witnesses. Trump's defense team argued that certain witnesses should be granted immunity in exchange for their testimony, while the prosecution argued that immunity was not necessary. The court ultimately ruled in favor of the prosecution, denying the request for immunity.\n\n### Appeals\n\nTrump's defense team appealed the court's decision on immunity, arguing that the ruling was incorrect and would prejudice their client's right to a fair trial.\n\n### Proceedings Resulting from the Immunity Decision\n\nFollowing the court's decision on immunity, the prosecution filed a motion to compel certain witnesses to testify. Trump's defense team responded with a motion to quash the subpoenas, arguing that the witnesses were not required to testify.\n\n## Post-immunity Timetable\n\nFollowing the resolution of the immunity dispute, the court set a revised timetable for pretrial proceedings. The revised timetable includes deadlines for the filing of pretrial motions and the exchange of discovery materials.\n\n# Potential Witnesses and Evidence\n\n## Prosecution\n\nThe prosecution is expected to call several witnesses, including former Trump advisors and associates, as well as state officials who were allegedly pressured by Trump to change the outcome of the election. The prosecution is also expected to present evidence, including documents and recordings, that demonstrate Trump's involvement in the scheme to defraud the United States and obstruct the certification of the presidential election results.\n\n## Defense\n\nTrump's defense team is expected to call several witnesses, including experts and fact witnesses, to testify on their client's behalf. The defense is also expected to present evidence, including documents and recordings, that demonstrate Trump's innocence and challenge the prosecution's case.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## Defendant\n\nTrump has denied all allegations and has characterized the indictment as a \"witch hunt.\" Trump has also attacked the prosecution and the court, accusing them of being biased and unfair.\n\n## Republicans in Support of the Indictment\n\nSome Republicans have expressed support for the indictment, arguing that Trump's actions were unacceptable and that he must be held accountable.\n\n## Republicans Opposed to the Indictment\n\nOther Republicans have expressed opposition to the indictment, arguing that it is politically motivated and that Trump is being unfairly targeted.\n\n## Democrats in Support of the Indictment\n\nMany Democrats have expressed support for the indictment, arguing that Trump's actions were a clear attempt to undermine democracy and that he must be held accountable.\n\n# See also\n\n* 2020 United States presidential election\n* January 6 United States Capitol attack\n* Trump–Ukraine scandal\n* Mueller Report\n\n# References\n\n## Footnotes\n\n## Citations\n\n## Works cited\n\n# External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Federal_prosecution_of_Donald_Trump_(election_obstruction_case)\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Accusations of electoral fraud and attempts to overturn the election\n##January 6 Capitol attack and investigations\n#Original indictment and arraignment\n#Superseding indictment and arraignment\n#Statements in the indictment\n##Allegations and statements\n##Count One: Conspiracy to defraud the United States\n##Further allegations and statements\n##Count Two: Conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding\n##Count Three: Obstruction of an official proceeding\n##Count Four: Conspiracy against rights\n#Co-conspirators\n#Pretrial proceedings\n##Initial timetable\n##Protective orders and security measures\n##Other pre-trial motions\n##Immunity dispute\n###Appeals\n###Proceedings resulting from the immunity decision\n##Post-immunity timetable\n#Potential witnesses and evidence\n##Prosecution\n##Defense\n#Reactions\n##Defendant\n##Republicans in support of the indictment\n##Republicans opposed to the indictment\n##Democrats in support of the indictment\n#See also\n#References\n##Footnotes\n##Citations\n##Works cited\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
